    "description": "PyTin is a CGI framework that provides shortcuts for application writers to\nfocus less on common tasks and more on their application's functionality.\n\nRequests\n========\nRequests take all the data that exists in different areas like environment\nvariables and standard input, and puts it all into one, cleanly organized\nobject.\n\nResponses\n=========\nResponses are file-like objects, but with convenience methods named ``w`` (with\na newline) and ``wn`` (without one). They also have custom attributes for\nsetting common HTTP headers like ``Content-Type`` and ``Location``.\n\nRQMods/RSMods\n=============\nThese are applied to requests and responses. You pass a list of them as the\n``rqmods`` and ``rsmods`` keyword arguments. They're not required, and PyTin\ndoesn't even ship with any (yet), but they could be very helpful if you're in\na situation where you'd need one.\n\nBake\n====\nBake is the major function you need to know. It will publish your object,\ncollect the environment variables, enable tracebacks if needed, and pass extra\nsettings to your application. After your request has been returned, it will be\ncompiled and returned.\n\nPrebake\n=======\nThe prebake function is designed to allow extra security and lighter script\nfiles. It's a command-line-based wizard that produces a simple file that imports\na function stored in a module and automatically bakes it.",
