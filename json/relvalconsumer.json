    "description": "relvalconsumer\n==============\n\n``relvalconsumer`` is a fedmsg consumer for creating Fedora release\nvalidation test events. It replaces the old\n``relval nightly --if-needed`` sub-command, which was expected to be run\nnightly as a cron job. Like the old system, each time a compose appears,\nit runs various checks to decide whether it should create an event for\nthe compose. It creates events for both nightly composes and 'candidate'\ncomposes.\n\nIt should create a first nightly for the next release shortly after a\nrelease goes out. From then until the release, it will create new\nnightly events periodically. It will never create a nightly event fewer\nthan three days after the current event. Between three and fourteen days\nafter the current event, it will create a new event if certain packages\nhave changed (these are defined in the code). After fourteen days it\nwill create an event as soon as a nightly compose appears. It will\ncreate events for all candidate composes as soon as they appear.\n\nIt should never create an event for a given release from a Rawhide\ncompose after that release branches, because at that point wikitcms will\ndecide that any notional event for a Rawhide compose would be for the\nrelease *two* after the current stable release, and this script will\ncreate events only for the release *one* after the current stable\nrelease.\n\nNote that in production mode the consumer is configured to create events\nin the production wiki and send announcement emails to the test@ mailing\nlist. So, really, only one person should ever have it running in\nproduction mode, and that's probably me. Please don't run it in\nproduction mode unless you're taking over my job or something.\n\nThe code was written with Python 3 in mind, but it turns out that\nverification of fedmsg message signatures does not currently work in\nPython 3, so it should be run under Python 2 for now.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nPython libraries:\n\n-  `fedmsg <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedmsg>`__\n-  `fedfind <https://pagure.io/fedora-qa/fedfind>`__\n-  `wikitcms <https://pagure.io/fedora-qa/python-wikitcms>`__\n-  `mwclient <https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient>`__\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall the required external Python libraries, then use setuptools to\ninstall, e.g.:\n\n::\n\n        python setup.py install\n\nTest and production modes\n-------------------------\n\nTwo consumers are provided, a 'test' and a 'production' consumer. For\n'test':\n\n-  The consumer listens for ``dev`` (not ``prod``) messages\n-  The consumer does not validate message signatures\n-  The consumer creates events on the staging wiki (not production wiki)\n-  The announcement email is logged rather than being mailed out\n\nIn this mode it is fairly safe to play around with the consumer, and you\ncan use a tool like ``fedmsg-dg-replay`` to trigger event creation by\nreplaying a relevant fedmsg (which will show up with a ``dev`` topic\nrather than ``prod``).\n\nFor 'production':\n\n-  The consumer listens for ``prod`` (not ``dev``) messages\n-  The consumer validates message signatures\n-  **The consumer creates events on the production wiki**\n-  **The consumer sends email notifications to public mailing lists**\n\n**PLEASE** do not enable the production consumer unless you're\nabsolutely sure it's your job to create the official events.\n\nThe fedmsg config keys for the consumers are\n``relvalconsumer.test.enabled`` and ``relvalconsumer.prod.enabled``\nrespectively.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n``relvalconsumer`` is released under the\n`GPL <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt>`__, version 3 or later. See\n``COPYING`` and the header of ``relvalconsumer.py`` itself.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nIssues and pull requests can be filed in\n`Pagure <https://pagure.io/fedora-qa/relvalconsumer>`__.
