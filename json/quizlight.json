    "description": "# quizlight\nquizlight is a simple terminal-based program for test taking and creation. It is written in Python 3. It comes with a Python 3 test module, based on [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/).\n\n## Installing\nSee the latest instructions on the [releases page](https://github.com/dogoncouch/quizlight/releases)\n\n\n# Usage\n\n## Options\n    usage: quizlight [-h] [--version] [-d DIRECTORY] [--learn] [file]\n    \n    positional arguments:\n      file          set the module import file\n    \n    optional arguments:\n      -h, --help    show this help message and exit\n      --version     show program's version number and exit\n      -d DIRECTORY  set the module import directory\n      --learn       turn on learning mode (immediate answer feedback)\n\n## Interface\nquizlight has a menu driven interface, based on the lightcli library. There are two modes: test mode, and edit mode.\n\n### Test mode\nTest mode is for taking tests. Tests in `/usr/share/doc/quizlight/modules` are loaded by default, unless another directory or file is specified.\n\nTest mode is somewhat secure. EOF and Keyboard Interrupt errors are caught, and there should be no way to get back to the start of the test after a result file is selected. To let someone take a test, save the results, and log them out of the system, run quizlight as follows:\n\n    quizlight ; exit\n\nSelect the module, set the save file for results, and the test should be somewhat secure. This has NOT been extensively tested.\n\n#### Learning mode\nLearning mode turns on immediate answer feedback. After each question is answered, the correct answer is shown, along with the reason (if present).\n\n### Edit mode\nEdit mode is for creating and extending tests. It allows the user to create new tests, add new chapters to existing tests, and extend existing chapters. Editing requires write permission on the module file. Chapters and questions can not be deleted within quizlight.\n\n\n# Modules\n\n## Files\nquizlight modules are stored in python JSON format. quizlight will automatically add the `.json` file extension to new modules, unless it is already there. Files can be written to and loaded from any directory (assuming the right permissions). By default, quizlight looks for modules to load in `/usr/share/doc/quizlight/modules`.\n\n## Creating and Editing\nCreating and editing modules is easy; edit mode functions as an interactive guide. There are four steps:\n1. Enter a question prompt\n2. Enter a list of answers\n3. Set the correct answer\n4. Enter a reason (optional)\n\nHere is an example:\n\n#### Enter a question prompt\n    \n    Which animal is the most dangerous?\n\n    a. Fox\n    b. Rabbit\n    c. Lion\n    d. Elephant\n\n#### Enter a list of answers\n    \n    a\n    b\n    c\n    d\n\n#### Set the correct answer\n    \n    b\n\n#### Enter a reason\n    \n    According to a well respected british documentary about King Arthur, there are very dangerous rabbits out there.\n\n## Contributing\nCommunity contributions are welcome!
