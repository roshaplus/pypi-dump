But when the errand fails, Ripley kills the installation and begins\nto assume his life.\n\n  .. |---| unicode:: U+2014  .. em dash\n\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nThis package provides a simple way to replay requests made to a web server,\nfor example an existing Zope/Plone site, to another Zope/Plone site.  It has\na slight speech impediment, though, causing it to not being able to \"ripley\"\nall of those requests correctly (e.g. POSTs) and also not to pronounce its\nown name.  This was probably caused by the fact that the package was created\non a Silly Friday |tm|.\n\n  .. |tm| unicode:: U+2122  .. trademark\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.0a1 - Unreleased\n------------------\n\n* Initial release\n  [witsch]",
