    "description": "jtypes.jython\n=============\n\nJava Embedded Python.\n\nOverview\n========\n\n  | jtypes.jython embeds CPython in Java.\n  | It is safe to use in a heavily threaded environment.\n  |\n  | jtypes.jython is a Python Java package, based on the ctypes FFI library.\n  | It is an implementation of substantial part of Jython Java bridge and API\n    by reimplementing it's functionality and in a clean CPython.\n\nAbout Jython:\n-------------\n\nNote from the `original website <http://www.jython.org/archive/22/>`__:\n\n  **What is Jython?**\n\n  Jython is an implementation of the high-level, dynamic, object-oriented language Python\n  seamlessly integrated with the Java platform. The predecessor to Jython, JPython,\n  is certified as 100% Pure Java. Jython is freely available for both commercial and\n  non-commercial use and is distributed with source code. Jython is complementary to Java\n  and is especially suited for the following tasks:\n\n  Embedded scripting - Java programmers can add the Jython libraries to their system\n  to allow end users to write simple or complicated scripts that add functionality to the\n  application. Interactive experimentation - Jython provides an interactive interpreter\n  that can be used to interact with Java packages or with running Java applications.\n  This allows programmers to experiment and debug any Java system using Jython.\n  Rapid application development - Python programs are typically 2-10X shorter than the\n  equivalent Java program. This translates directly to increased programmer productivity.\n  The seamless interaction between Python and Java allows developers to freely mix the two\n  languages both during development and in shipping products.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n- Java >= 1.6 - either the Sun/Oracle JRE/JDK or OpenJDK.\n- Numpy (optional) >= 1.5 (numpy >= 1.7 recommended)\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n::\n\n    pip install --upgrade jtypes.jython\n\nTo ensure everything is running correctly you can run the tests using\n\n::\n\n    python -m jt.jython.tests\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n+ Python 2.7 or higher or 3.3 or higher\n\n  * http://www.python.org/\n  * Versions lower than 2.7 or lower than 3.3 WON'T WORK.\n  * 2.7 and 3.4 are primary test environments.\n\n+ pip or setuptools\n\n  * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip\n  * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n  | Copyright (c) 2014-2016 Adam Karpierz\n  |\n  | Licensed under the zlib/libpng License\n  | http://opensource.org/licenses/zlib\n  | Please refer to the LICENSE file.\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\n* Adam Karpierz <python@python.pl>\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n0.0.0 (2012-10-05)\n------------------\n- Initial version.",
