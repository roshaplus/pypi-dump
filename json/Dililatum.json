    "description": "=========\nDililatum\n=========\n\nHave you ever heard of Dililatum?\n\nPerhaps not. For Dililatum is Something New. Dililatum has a quest;\nand that quest is to distribute Python power to quest-oriented\nRPG-like computer-based keyboard-using video games. At least that's\nits purpose.\n\nDililatum can be considered a game engine, but in reality it's a game\nlibrary. It is written in Python using PyGame for graphics and sound\nin games. Dililatum also depends on NumPy. More specifically, it's\nlike this:\n\n\nDependencies\n============\n\nDililatum depends on the following programs/libraries::\n\n    Python 2.5+\n    Dililatum is written in Python\n    <http://python.org/>\n    Debian etc.: apt-get install python\n    Fedora etc.: yum install python\n\n    PyGame 1.8.1+\n    Dililatum uses PyGame for its graphics and sound\n    <http://python.org/>\n    Debian etc.: apt-get install python-pygame\n    Fedora etc.: yum install pygame\n\n    NumPy\n    Dililatum uses NumPy for internal arrays describing\n    where it's okay to walk -- and where it's not ok.\n    <http://numpy.scipy.org/>\n    Debian etc.: apt-get install python-numpy\n    Fedora etc.: yum install python-numpy\n\nOptional modules\n----------------\n\nAdditionally, you can also install these libraries::\n\n    setproctitle\n    Changes 'python' to 'dililatum'\n    <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setproctitle/>\n    sudo easy_install setproctitle\n\n    termcolor\n    Colors Dililatum's terminal output\n    <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor>\n    sudo easy_install termcolor\n\n\nDetails\n=======\n\nDililatum is released under the GNU GPLv3+ and is free\nsoftware. Dililatum is downloadable from\nhttp://metanohi.org/projects/dililatum/. The version of this\nDililatum is v0.1. Many features are not complete yet.\n\nFor an example of what Dililatum is capable of, try downloading\nForestQuest. It's available at\nhttp://metanohi.org/projects/forestquest/. It's still a work in\nprogress, but it works.\n\nThe logo of Dililatum, found in the \"logo\" directory, is available\nunder the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 (or\nany later version) Unported license. A copy of this license is\navailable at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n\n\nInstalling\n==========\n\nTo install Dililatum, write this in a terminal::\n\n    $ ./setup.py install\n\nAfter installing it, you can run it like this::\n\n    $ dililatum GAME\n\nIf you choose not to install it, the Python file you should run is\ncalled \"dililatum\" and located in the \"bin\" directory.\n\nNote that Dililatum has many command-line options, which is why it's a\ngood idea to run \"dililatum --help\".\n\nDililatum comes with several tools for more easily developing\ngames. These are named 'dilatiumdev*'.\n\nDocumentation is available in the \"docs\" directory.\n\nDevelopers are very welcome.\n\nThe original author of Dililatum is Niels Serup <ns@metanohi.org>.",
