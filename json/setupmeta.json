    "description": "Simplify your ``setup.py``\n==========================\n\nWriting a ``setup.py`` typically involves lots of boilerplate and copy-pasting from project to project.\n\nThis package aims to simplify that, here's what your setup.py could look like with setupmeta_::\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Short description of the project\n    \"\"\"\n\n    from setuptools import setup\n\n    __version__ = '1.0.0'                   # This could come instead from your __about__.py etc (see below)\n    __title__ = 'myproject'                 # Some project like to have this as a reusable constant\n\n    setup(\n        setup_requires='setupmeta'          # This is where setupmeta comes in\n    )\n\nAnd that should be it - setupmeta_ will take it from there, extracting everything else from your project, following the typical conventions commonly used.\n\nYou can use the explain_ command to see what setupmeta deduced from your project, for the above it would look like so (you can see which file, and which line each setting came from)::\n\n    Definitions:\n    ------------\n         description: (setup.py:2) Short description of the project\n                name: (setup.py:8) myproject\n          py_modules: (auto-fill ) ['myproject']\n             version: (setup.py:7) 1.0.0\n\n\nSee examples_ for more.\n\nNote that setuptools_ **version 38+** is required, if your version is too old, you can see the `alternative way`_ of using setupmeta.\n\n\nHow it works?\n=============\n\n- Everything that you explicitly provide in your original ``setup.py`` -> ``setup()`` call is taken as-is (never changed), and internally labelled as ``explicit`` (see the explain_ command below).\n  So if you don't like something that setupmeta deduces, you can always explicitly state it.\n\n- ``name`` is auto-filled from your setup.py's ``__title__``, if there is one (sometimes having a constant is quite handy...)\n\n- ``description`` will be the 1st line of the docstring of your ``setup.py``\n\n- ``packages`` and ``package_dir`` is auto-filled accordingly if you have a ``<name>/__init__.py`` or ``src/<name>/__init__.py`` file\n\n- ``py_modules`` is auto-filled if you have a ``<name>.py`` file\n\n- ``version``, ``url``, ``download_url``, ``license``, ``keywords``, ``author``, ``contact``, ``maintainer``, and ``platforms`` will be auto-filled from:\n\n    - Lines of the form ``__version__ = \"1.0.0\"`` in your modules (simple constants only, expressions are ignored - the modules are not imported but scanned using regexes)\n\n    - Lines of the form ``version: 1.0.0`` in your docstring\n\n    - Files are examined in this order (first find wins):\n\n        - ``setup.py``\n\n        - ``<package>.py`` (mccabe_ for example)\n\n        - ``<package>/__about__.py`` (cryptography_, pipfile_ for example do this)\n\n        - ``<package>/__version__.py`` (requests_ for example)\n\n        - ``<package>/__init__.py`` (changes_, arrow_ for example)\n\n        - ``src/`` is also examined (for those who like to have their packages under ``src``)\n\n    - URLs can be simplified:\n\n        - ``url`` may use ``{name}``, it will be expanded appropriately\n\n        - if ``url`` points to your general github repo (like: https://github.com/zsimic), the ``name`` of your project is auto-appended to it\n\n        - if ``download_url`` is a relative path, it is auto-filled by prefixing it with ``url``\n\n        - ``download_url`` may use ``{name}`` and/or ``{version}``, those will be expanded appropriately\n\n    - ``author``, ``maintainer`` and ``contact`` names and emails can be combined into one line (setupmeta will figure out the email part and auto-fill it properly)\n\n        - i.e.: ``author: Bob D bob@d.com`` will yield the proper ``author`` and ``author_email`` settings\n\n- ``long_description`` is auto-filled from your README file (looking for ``README.rst``, ``README.md``, then ``README*``, first one found wins).\n  Special tokens can be used (notation aimed at them easily being `rst comments`_):\n\n    - ``.. [[end long_description]]`` as end marker, so you don't have to use the entire file as long description\n\n    - ``.. [[include <relative-path>]]`` if you want another file included as well (for example, people like to add ``HISTORY.txt`` as well)\n\n    - these tokens must appear either at beginning/end of line, or be after/before at least one space character\n\n- ``classifiers`` is auto-filled from file ``classifiers.txt`` (one classification per line, ignoring empty lines and python style comments)\n\n- ``entry_points`` is auto-filled from file ``entry_points.ini`` (bonus: tools like PyCharm have a nice syntax highlighter for those)\n\n- ``install_requires`` is auto-filled if you have a pipfile_ (or the old school ``requirements.txt`` or ``pinned.txt`` file)\n\n- ``tests_require`` is auto-filled if you have a pipfile_ (or ``requirements-dev.txt`` file)\n\n- ``test_suite`` is auto-filled to ``tests`` folder if you have one (no other places are examined, stick to the standard)\n\n- ``py.test`` is automatically used for ``setup.py test`` if you have it in your pipfile_ (or reqs).\n\nThis should hopefully work nicely for the vast majority of python projects out there.\nIf you need advanced stuff, you can still leverage ``setupmeta`` for all the usual stuff above, and go explicit wherever needed.\n\n\nCommands\n========\n\n``setupmeta`` also introduces a few commands to make your life easier (more to come in the future).\n\n\nexplain\n-------\n\n``python setup.py explain`` will show you what ``setupmeta`` found out about your project, what definitions came from where, example::\n\n    ~/dev/setupmeta: python setup.py explain\n    Definitions:\n    ------------\n              author: (auto-adjust    ) Zoran Simic\n                  \\_: (setupmeta.py:27) Zoran Simic zoran@simicweb.com\n        author_email: (auto-adjust    ) zoran@simicweb.com\n         classifiers: (classifiers.txt) 247 chars [Development Status :: 4 - Beta ...]\n         description: (setup.py:2     ) Simplify your setup.py\n            keywords: (setup.py:4     ) convenient, setup.py\n             license: (setupmeta.py:25) MIT\n    long_description: (README.rst     ) 7754 chars [Simplify your setup.py ======= ...]\n                name: (explicit       ) setupmeta\n          py_modules: (auto-fill      ) ['setupmeta']\n         script_args: (explicit       ) ['explain']\n         script_name: (explicit       ) setup.py\n       tests_require: (Pipfile        ) ['coverage', 'flake8', 'mock', 'pytest', 'pytest-runner']\n                 url: (setupmeta.py:26) https://github.com/zsimic/setupmeta\n             version: (setupmeta.py:24) 0.0.1\n\nIn the above output:\n\n- The ``author`` key was seen in ``setupmeta.py`` line 27, and the value was name + email,\n  that got \"auto-adjusted\" and filled in as ``author`` + ``author_email`` properly as shown.\n\n- Note that the ``\\_`` indication tries to convey the fact that ``author`` in this example had a value that came from 2 different sources,\n  final value showing at top, while all the other values seen showing below with the ``\\_`` indicator.\n\n- ``classifiers`` came from file ``classifiers.txt``, ``description`` came from ``setup.py`` line 2, etc\n\n- ``name`` was ``explicit`` (ie: explicitly given to the original ``setup()`` call in ``setup.py``)\n\n- ``py_modules`` was auto-filled to ``['setupmeta']``\n\n- Note that ``script_args`` and ``script_name`` are injected by setuptools\n  (they appear as \"explicit\" from setupmeta's point of view - you get some insight as to what setuptools is doing here as well)\n\n\nentrypoints\n-----------\n\nThis will simply show you your ``entry_points/console_scripts``. I added it because pygradle_ requires it (if you use pygradle_, it'll come in handy...).\n\n\ntest\n----\n\n\nThe ``test`` command is customized to run ``pytest``, if you have it as a test/dev dependency.\nIf you don't, then setupmeta falls back to the regulars setuptools implementation for the test command...\n\nNote that **all** tests are ran via ``py.tests -vvv <test_suite>``, you can't customize that (no options supported).\nJust use something like ``pipenv run py.test ...`` if you want to run a subset of tests, ``setup.py``'s CLI interface is wonky anyway.\n\n\nupload\n------\n\nUpload was customized to use ``twine upload``, if you don't have twine_ installed, the ``upload`` command will fail (I hear the default one is not good, so not falling back to it...)\n\n\n.. _setupmeta: https://github.com/zsimic/setupmeta\n\n.. _alternative way: https://github.com/zsimic/setupmeta/alternative-way.rst\n\n.. _examples: https://github.com/zsimic/setupmeta/tree/master/examples\n\n.. _setuptools: https://github.com/pypa/setuptools\n\n.. _twine: https://github.com/pypa/twine\n\n.. _rst comments: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#comments\n\n.. _pipfile: https://github.com/pypa/pipfile\n\n.. _requests: https://github.com/requests/requests/tree/master/requests\n\n.. _cryptography: https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/tree/master/src/cryptography\n\n.. _changes: https://github.com/michaeljoseph/changes/blob/master/changes/__init__.py\n\n.. _arrow: https://github.com/crsmithdev/arrow/blob/master/arrow/__init__.py\n\n.. _mccabe: https://github.com/PyCQA/mccabe/blob/master/mccabe.py\n\n.. _pygradle: https://github.com/linkedin/pygradle/\n\n----\n\n=======\nHistory\n=======\n\n0.0.3 (2017-12-03)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed bootstrap, so that ``PKG-INFO`` gets the right metadata (bootstrapping in 2 passes)\n\n* setupmeta can now be used via ``setup_requires='setupmeta'``\n\n* Allow to use portion of README via ``.. [[end long_description]]``\n\n* Allow to use include other files in long description via something like ``.. [[include HISTORY.rst]]``\n\n",
