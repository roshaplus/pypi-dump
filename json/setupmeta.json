    "description": "Simplify your setup.py\n======================\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/setupmeta.svg\n    :target: https://pypi.org/project/setupmeta/\n    :alt: version\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/zsimic/setupmeta.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/zsimic/setupmeta\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/setupmeta.svg\n    :target: https://github.com/zsimic/setupmeta\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/zsimic/setupmeta.svg\n    :target: https://github.com/zsimic/setupmeta\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/setupmeta.svg\n\n----\n\nWriting a ``setup.py`` typically involves lots of boilerplate and copy-pasting from project to project.\n\nThis package aims to simplify that and bring some DRY_ principle to python packaging.\nHere's what your setup.py could look like with setupmeta_::\n\n    from setuptools import setup\n\n    __version__ = '1.0.0'               # This can come from your __about__.py etc\n\n    setup(\n        name='myproject',\n        setup_requires='setupmeta'      # This is where setupmeta comes in\n    )\n\nAnd that should be it (even the ``__version__`` mention above is not necessary, it's there for illustration purposes) - setupmeta_ will\ntake it from there, extracting everything else from your project, following the typical conventions commonly used.\n\nYou can use the explain_ command to see what setupmeta deduced from your project, for the above it would look like so\n(you can see which file, and which line each setting came from)::\n\n    ~/myproject: python setup.py explain\n         description: (setup.py:2) First line of your README\n    long_description: (README.rst) Long description would be your inlined README\n                name: (setup.py:6) myproject\n          py_modules: (auto-fill ) ['myproject']\n             version: (setup.py:3) 1.0.0\n\nThe above would be what you get with just those few lines in your ``setup.py``, plus a ``README.rst`` file\n(assumed here for auto-fill illustration purposes - you don't have to have those, they just get automatically picked up if you do)\n\nSee examples_ for more.\n\n\nHow it works?\n=============\n\n- Everything that you explicitly provide in your original ``setuptools.setup()`` call is taken as-is (never changed), and internally labelled as ``explicit`` (see the explain_ command below).\n  So if you don't like something that setupmeta deduces, you can always explicitly state it.\n\n- ``name`` is auto-filled from your setup.py's ``__title__``, if there is one (sometimes having a constant is quite handy...)\n\n- ``packages`` and ``package_dir`` is auto-filled accordingly if you have a ``<name>/__init__.py`` or ``src/<name>/__init__.py`` file\n\n- ``py_modules`` is auto-filled if you have a ``<name>.py`` file\n\n- ``description`` will be the 1st line of your README (unless that 1st line is too short, or is just the project's name),\n  or the 1st line of the first docstring found in the scanned files (see list below)\n\n- ``version`` can be stated explicitly, or be computed from git tags using ``versioning='tag'``, in which case:\n\n    - If git tag is of the form ``v<Major>.<minor>.<patch>``, version will correspond to that tag, with ``bN`` added if there are commits since that tag (N being the number of changes since tag)\n\n    - If git tag is of the form ``v<Major>.<minor>``, version will be auto-complete with <patch> deduced from how many commits occurred since latest tag\n\n    - Use the bump_ command to easily bump (ie: increment major, minor or patch + apply git tag)\n\n    - See VERSIONING_ for more info\n\n- ``version``, ``url``, ``download_url``, ``license``, ``keywords``, ``author``, ``contact``, ``maintainer``, and ``platforms`` will be auto-filled from:\n\n    - Lines of the form ``__version__ = \"1.0.0\"`` in your modules (simple constants only, expressions are ignored - the modules are not imported but scanned using regexes)\n\n    - Lines of the form ``version: 1.0.0`` in your docstring\n\n    - Files are examined in this order (first find wins):\n\n        - ``setup.py``\n\n        - ``<package>.py`` (mccabe_ for example)\n\n        - ``<package>/__about__.py`` (cryptography_ for example)\n\n        - ``<package>/__version__.py`` (requests_ for example)\n\n        - ``<package>/__init__.py`` (changes_, arrow_ for example)\n\n        - ``src/`` is also examined (for those who like to have their packages under ``src``)\n\n    - URLs can be simplified:\n\n        - ``url`` may use ``{name}``, it will be expanded appropriately\n\n        - if ``url`` points to your general github repo (like: https://github.com/zsimic), the ``name`` of your project is auto-appended to it\n\n        - if ``download_url`` is a relative path, it is auto-filled by prefixing it with ``url``\n\n        - ``download_url`` may use ``{name}`` and/or ``{version}``, those will be expanded appropriately\n\n    - ``author``, ``maintainer`` and ``contact`` names and emails can be combined into one line (setupmeta will figure out the email part and auto-fill it properly)\n\n        - i.e.: ``author: Bob D bob@d.com`` will yield the proper ``author`` and ``author_email`` settings\n\n- ``long_description`` is auto-filled from your README file (looking for ``README.rst``, ``README.md``, then ``README*``, first one found wins).\n  Special tokens can be used (notation aimed at them easily being `rst comments`_):\n\n    - ``.. [[end long_description]]`` as end marker, so you don't have to use the entire file as long description\n\n    - ``.. [[include <relative-path>]]`` if you want another file included as well (for example, people like to add ``HISTORY.txt`` as well)\n\n    - these tokens must appear either at beginning/end of line, or be after/before at least one space character\n\n- ``classifiers`` is auto-filled from file ``classifiers.txt`` (one classification per line, ignoring empty lines and python style comments)\n\n- ``entry_points`` is auto-filled from file ``entry_points.ini`` (bonus: tools like PyCharm have a nice syntax highlighter for those)\n\n- ``install_requires`` is auto-filled if you have a ``requirements.txt`` (or ``pinned.txt``) file\n\nThis should hopefully work nicely for the vast majority of python projects out there.\nIf you need advanced stuff, you can still leverage ``setupmeta`` for all the usual stuff above, and go explicit wherever needed.\n\n\nVersioning\n==========\n\nsetumeta can also help with versioning, by leveraging git tags (a bit like setuptools_scm_).\nYou can leverage that feature by specifying a ``versioning`` attribute, either in your ``setup.py``\n(or ``__versioning__`` in one of your ``__init__.py``-s, works similarly to how all other fields are picked up as described above)\n\n2 simple strategies are pre-configured (see `versioning doc`_ for more info):\n\n* ``versioning='tag'`` to compute version from latest git tag + beta addendum\n\n    * suitable for controlled publications (1 tag = 1 publish)\n\n    * format is ``{major}.{minor}.{patch}{beta}``\n\n    * tag \"v1.0.0\" at current commit -> version is 1.0.0\n\n    * one commit after tag \"v1.0.0\" -> version becomes 1.0.0b1\n\n* ``versioning='changes'`` to compute version from latest git tag + number of changes since that tag\n\n    * suitable for \"publish on every commit\" (without having to tag every commit)\n\n    * format is ``{major}.{minor}.{changes}``\n\n    * tag \"v1.0\" at current commit -> version is 1.0.0 (last zero means \"zero changes\")\n\n    * one commit after tag \"v1.0\" -> version becomes 1.0.1\n\n* There's a \"local\" addendum when checkout is not clean, its default format is ``{dev}``\n\n* It's possible to fine-tune this via ``versioning=dict(...)`` (see `versioning doc`_ for more info)\n\n\nCommands\n========\n\n``setupmeta`` also introduces a few commands to make your life easier (more to come in the future).\n\n\nexplain\n-------\n\n``python setup.py explain`` will show you what ``setupmeta`` found out about your project, what definitions came from where.\n\nFor example, this is what setupmeta says about itself (it's self-using)::\n\n    ~/dev/setupmeta: python setup.py explain\n              author: (auto-adjust            ) Zoran Simic\n                  \\_: (setupmeta/__init__.py:6) Zoran Simic zoran@simicweb.com\n        author_email: (auto-adjust            ) zoran@simicweb.com\n         classifiers: (classifiers.txt        ) 22 items: ['Development Status :: 4 -

this simply means the constant ``__title__`` was used as ``name``\n\n- Note that ``title*`` is shown with an asterisk, the asterisk means that setupmeta saw the value and can use it, but doesn't transfer it to setuptools\n\n- ``packages`` was auto-filled to ``['setupmeta']``\n\n- ``version`` was determined from git tag (due to ``versioning='tag'`` in setup.py), in this case ``0.7.3b1.dev1`` means:\n\n    * latest tag was 0.7.3\n\n    * there was one commit since that (``b1`` means one change since tag, \"b\" denotes this would be a \"beta\" version, and should play nicely with PEP-440_)\n\n    * the ``.dev1`` suffix means that the checkout wasn't clean when ``explain`` command was ran here\n\n\nbump\n----\n\nIf you're using the ``versioning='tag'`` feature, you can then use the ``python setup.py bump`` command to bump your git-tag driven version. See ``--help`` for more info.\nTypical usage::\n\n    python setup.py bump --help             # What were the options?\n    python setup.py bump --minor            # Check everything looks as expected\n    python setup.py bump --minor --commit   # Effectively bump\n\n\nentrypoints\n-----------\n\nThis will simply show you your ``entry_points/console_scripts``. I added it because pygradle_ requires it (if you use pygradle_, it'll come in handy...).\n\n.. _DRY: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself\n\n.. _setuptools_scm: https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm\n\n.. _versioning doc: https://github.com/zsimic/setupmeta/blob/master/VERSIONING.rst\n\n.. _PEP-440: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/\n\n.. _setupmeta: https://github.com/zsimic/setupmeta\n\n.. _examples: https://github.com/zsimic/setupmeta/tree/master/examples\n\n.. _setuptools: https://github.com/pypa/setuptools\n\n.. _rst comments: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#comments\n\n.. _requests: https://github.com/requests/requests/tree/master/requests\n\n.. _cryptography: https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/tree/master/src/cryptography\n\n.. _changes: https://github.com/michaeljoseph/changes/blob/master/changes/__init__.py\n\n.. _arrow: https://github.com/crsmithdev/arrow/blob/master/arrow/__init__.py\n\n.. _mccabe: https://github.com/PyCQA/mccabe/blob/master/mccabe.py\n\n.. _pygradle: https://github.com/linkedin/pygradle/\n\n=======\nHistory\n=======\n\n0.7.10 (2017-12-25)\n-------------------\n\n* Better defined versioning strategies\n\n",
