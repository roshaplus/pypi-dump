Work is in\nprogress!*\n\nThe file management automation tool.\nInstall with ``pip install organize`` (Python 3+ only).\n\n\nWhy you might find this useful\n------------------------------\nYour desktop is a mess? You cannot find anything in your downloads and\ndocuments? Sorting and renaming all these files by hand is too tedious?\nTime to automate it once and benefit from it forever.\n\nThe following yaml code goes into a file named `config.yaml` in the folder\nshown with ``$ organize config``:\n\n- `config.yaml`:\n\n  .. code:: yaml\n\n      rules:\n        - folders: '~/Desktop'\n          filters:\n            - FileExtension:\n                - png\n                - jpg\n            - OlderThan: {years: 1}\n          actions:\n            - Trash\n\n``$ organize run`` will now move all PNGs and JPGs older than one year from your\ndesktop into the trash. It is that easy.\n\nFeeling insecure? Run ``$ organize sim`` to see what would happen without\ntouching your files.\n\nBut there is more. You want to move files, use custom\nshell scripts or match filenames with regular expressions?\n`organize` has you covered. You can even use template strings and extract\ninformation from your files.\n\nHave a look at the full documentation at organize.readthedocs.io.\n\n\nCommand line interface\n----------------------\n::\n\n    Usage:\n        organize sim\n        organize run\n        organize config\n        organize list\n        organize --help\n        organize --version\n\n    Arguments:\n        sim             Simulate organizing your files. This allows you to check your rules.\n        run             Organizes your files according to your rules.\n        config          Open the organize config folder\n        list            List available filters and actions\n\n    Options:\n        --version       Show program version and exit.\n        -h, --help      Show this screen and exit.\n",
