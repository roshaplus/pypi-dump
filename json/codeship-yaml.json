Codeship, though one of the\nmost appealing platforms, is missing this feature.  You have to add commands\nregarding setup, testing and deployment in your Codeship project settings.\nThis has various disadvantages, but even though `users are complaining`_\nCodeship is not planning to address the issue on its traditional build server\ninfrastructure.  (Only Codeship's new Docker-based infrastructure will finally\nmake you more happy.)\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nCreate a ``codeship.yml`` file in your repository at root level.  The syntax\nis inspired by `Travis CI`_ and `Shippable`_, though only limited features are\nsupported.  Example:\n\n.. code-block:: yaml\n\n   install:\n     - pip install flake8\n   before_script:\n     - touch codeship-yaml-was-here\n   script:\n     - flake8\n   after_success:\n     - echo \"Now we can deploy\"\n\nTo make Codeship read and interpret your ``codeship.yml`` file, and execute\nthe commands in it add the following lines in the **Setup Commands** text box\nat *Codeship* > *Select Project...* > *(your project)*, *Project Settings* >\n*Test Settings*.\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   pip install codeship-yaml\n   codeship-yaml\n\nThis will make ``codeship-yaml`` execute the commands you specified in the\ndefault sections in the following section order:\n\n#. ``install``\n#. ``before_script``\n#. ``script``\n#. ``after_success``\n\nMore Control\n------------\n\nIf you want more control over which sections are executed you can specify the\nrequested section as a parameter.  For example, you could add the following\ncommands into the below-mentioned text boxes of your Codeship project:\n\n*Project Settings* > *Test Settings* > **Setup Commands**\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   pip install codeship-yaml\n   codeship-yaml install\n\n*Project Settings* > *Test Settings* > **Test Commands**\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   codeship-yaml before_script script\n\n*Project Settings* > *Deployment* > **(branch name)**\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   codeship-yaml after_success\n\nAdding custom sections, other than the default ones, to your ``codeship.yml``\nfile is possible but discouraged (to avoid losing similarity with other build\nplatforms).  If you want an additional section, which is established on other\nplatforms already, please consider placing a `pull request`_.\n\nPython 3\n========\n\nThe build image of Codeship's classic infrastructure supports both `Python\n2.7 and 3.4`_, but for Python 3 some outdated packages will make you run into\nbroken builds (e.g. when you install `packages with environment markers`_ in\nsetup.py).\n\nTo have fully working Python 3.4 support use the following setup commands in\n*Project Settings* > *Test Settings* > **Setup Commands**:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   virtualenv -p $(which python3) \"${HOME}/cache/python3_env\"\n   . \"${HOME}/cache/python3_env/bin/activate\" && python --version\n   pip install --upgrade setuptools && pip list | grep setuptools\n\nUpdate:\n   More Python versions are now supported via a ``python.sh`` script\n   provided by Codeship. See the `top of the script`_ for usage instructions.\n\nContribute\n==========\n\nFor development we use `tox`_, which handles both static code analysis and\ntests for all supported Python versions.  ``tox`` is automatically installed\nfor the test runs and will work out-of-the-box when you run the tests through\n``setup.py``.  Unfortunately, you'll have to install ``virtualenv`` though:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   $ pip install virtualenv\n\nAfter making your code changes don't forget to add tests, and simply run:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   $ python setup.py test\n\nWhen you place a `pull request`_ all tests are run on the build server\ninfrastructure of `Codeship`_, `Travis CI`_, `Shippable`_ and `Vexor`_ again.\nPlease check if they all pass to ensure the syntax stays compatible across the\ndifferent build infrastructures.\n\nTo remove all build files and folders including Python byte code you can run:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   $ python setup.py clean\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nThis project is brought to you by `Painless Software`_, a best-practice\nconsultancy in software development.
