The service allows lookups by zip code and house number,\nproviding street name and city. The lookups will be triggered in the partner\nform views when a zip code or house number is entered or modified. Only\nDutch addresses (which is assumed to include addresses with no country) are\nauto-completed.\n\nMore info about the lookup service here: http://www.postcodeapi.nu/\n\nInstallation\n============\nThis module depends on the module partner_street_number, which will split\nup the street field into separate fields for street name and number.\n\nThis module can be gotten from https://github.com/oca/partner-contact/tree/9.0\n\nYou also need to have the 'pyPostcode' Python library by Stefan Jansen\ninstalled (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyPostcode).\n\nConfiguration\n=============\nPlease enter the API key that you request from PostcodeAPI into the system\nparameter 'l10n_nl_postcodeapi.apikey'\n\nProvinces are autocompleted if a country state with the exact name is found in\nthe system. A CSV file with the Dutch provinces is included in the data\ndirectory, but not loaded by default. You can import the file manually.\n\nCompatibility\n=============\nThis module is compatible with Odoo 9.0.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/176/9.0\n\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/l10n-netherlands/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed feedback.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n* Stefan Rijnhart (Therp BV) <stefan@therp.nl>\n\nMaintainer\n----------\n\n.. image:: http://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: http://odoo-community.org\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA at https://github.com/OCA/l10n-netherlands\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and promote its widespread use.\n\nTo contribute to this module, please visit http://odoo-community.org.",
