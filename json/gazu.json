    "description": "![Gazu Logo](https://gazu.cg-wire.com/gazu.png)\n\n# Gazu, stero\u00efds for your CG\u00a0tools\n\nGazu is a Python client that allows to fetch data easily from your CG production\nenvironment (tasks, shots, assets, casting and dependencies). \nMore than giving access to data, it allows to perform operations\nlike generating file paths, marking a task as started, setting a thumbnail on a\nshot and many more. To make it short, it will boost your pipeline tools!\n\nIt is made to be used with the [Zou API](https://zou.cg-wire.com). It requires\nan up and running instance of Zou to run properly.\n\n[![Build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/cgwire/gazu.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cgwire/gazu)\n\n[![Gitter badge](https://badges.gitter.im/cgwire/Lobby.png)](https://gitter.im/cgwire/Lobby)\n\n## Quickstart\n\nInstall Gazu in your application environment via pip:\n\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/cgwire/gazu.git\n```\n\nor clone this repository in a directory contained in your PYTHONPATH\nenvironment variable.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/cgwire/gazu.git\n```\n\nThe client requires a few extra configuration before being used. It needs\nto know where is located the API\u00a0server:\n\n```python\nimport gazu\n\ngazu.client.set_host(\"https://zou-server-url\")\n```\n\nLet's finish with an example. Fetch all the open projects:\n\n```\nprojects = gazu.projects.open_projects()\n```\n\nThen jump to the [documentation](https://gazu.cg-wire.com) to see what features\nare available!\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is available on a dedicated website:\n\n[https://gazu.cg-wire.com/](https://gazu.cg-wire.com)\n\n## Contributions\n\nAll contributions are welcome as long as they respect the [C4\ncontract](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4).\n\nCode must follow the pep8 convention.\n\n## About authors\n\nGazu is written by CG Wire, a company based in France. We help small to\nmidsize CG\u00a0studios to manage their production and build pipeline efficiently.\n\nWe apply software craftmanship principles as much as possible. We love\ncoding and consider that strong quality and good developer experience matter a\n lot.\nOur extensive experience allows studios to get better at doing software and\n focus\nmore on the artistic work.\n\nVisit [cg-wire.com](https://cg-wire.com) for more information.\n\n[![CGWire Logo](https://gazu.cg-wire.com/cgwire.png)](https://cg-wire.com)\n\n\n",
