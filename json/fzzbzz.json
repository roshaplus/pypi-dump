    "description": "==========================================\n``fzzbzz``: FizzBuzz. Just the Essentials.\n==========================================\n\nThis is a Python implementation of the classic\n`programming interview question <http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FizzBuzzTest>`_.\n\nExample Usage\n-------------\n\nWalking in to your umpteenth tech startup interview in as many years, you\npretty much know what to expect. You're led into a room where the two\ninterviewers sit. The one on the left sports a bright polo, a slight fauxhawk,\nand the easy smile that screams \"MBA\". To his left is a 20ish guy whose dark\nunkempt hair spills haphazardly over a thread-bare Django-Con T-shirt. On the\nside wall looms the centerpiece of every interview nightmare: a whiteboard.\n\n\"Thanks for coming in today,\" MBA says. \"Your level of... experience... is\nimpressive.\" The pause implies the understanding that he was still in diapers\nwhen you wrote your first object hierarchy. MBA glances toward Django, who\nlooks down at the papers in his lap.\n\n\"I noticed that you have a lot of experience with COBOL,\" Django says.\n\"Have you used any modern languages, like, say, Python?\"\nThe two of them gaze at you expectantly.\n\n\"Yes, actually, I've been using it for side projects since about version 1.4.\nIf you take a look at my GitHub profile you'll see...\"\n\n\"Great!\" MBA interjects. \"We're mostly a Python shop here, so why don't we\nstart with that.\" It's a statement more than a question. \"Are you familiar\nwith 'Fizz Buzz'?\"\n\nYou nod.\n\nMBA gestures toward the whiteboard. \"Why don't you quickly show us FizzBuzz\nin Python, for say, the numbers 1 to 100?\"\n\nYou stand up, walk to the wall, and grab the red marker from the tray, and\ndeftly scribble the following::\n\n    $ pip install fzzbzz\n    $ python -c \"import fzzbzz; fzzbzz(100)\"\n\nYou step back triumphantly. MBA and Django look at each other. Django laughs\nnervously. \"Nice one. But we really need to make sure that anyone we hire is\na competent coder, so...\"\n\n\"No,\" you interrupt. \"What you really need is to make sure that you're hiring\na competent *developer*, and a competent developer is someone who is intimately\nfamiliar with what free and open tools are available, and uses them effectively\nrather than re-inventing the wheel every time a new challenge comes up.\"\n\nThe smile has faded from MBA's face. \"That's well and good, but we really want\nto see your coding chops. Can you implement FizzBuzz in Python for us?\"\n\nYou look him in the eye for a moment, and without dropping his gaze reply,\n\"I already did.\"\n\nMBA and Django lean toward each other, whisper something, and then stand up.\nMBA extends his hand: \"thank you for coming in today; unfortunately I don't\nthink you're the right fit for this company. Best of luck.\"\n\nThey show you to the door, and you walk out onto the crowded sidewalk.\nSomeday you'll have to learn when to swallow your pride and play the game, but\nat least you can walk home knowing you were correct. Also, who would want\nto work for that stupid company anyway?",
