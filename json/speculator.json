Predicts the next trend of a ticker like USDT to BTC.\n\n`speculator/market.py`  Module with market technical analysis features and their setup to a machine learning model.\n\n`speculator/models/` Package of machine learning models.\n\n`speculator/examples/`  Package of python script examples of Speculator's API and their related documentation/walkthrough/how-to. **This is important to understand Speculator's API**\n\n`speculator/features/`  Package of market technical analysis indicators.\n\n`speculator/utils/` Package with modules for basic functions like getting market data from an API or converting dates to epochs.\n\n### Dependencies\nMake sure these packages are installed before running Speculator:\n* [Delorean](http://delorean.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html), `pip3 install delorean`\n* [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/#install) `pip3 install requests`\n* [NumPy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html), `pip3 install numpy`\n* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html), `pip3 install scikit-learn`\n* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html), `pip3 install pandas`\n\nOr just use a one-liner:\n``` bash\npip3 install delorean requests numpy scikit-learn pandas\n```\n\n## Contact for Feedback, Questions, or Issues\nFeel free to send me a message on Reddit at [/u/shneap](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=shneap).  I am happy to hear any concerns, good or bad, in order to progress the development of this project.\n\n\n### Contributing\nPlease read the detailed [contributing doc](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Basis\nPart of this project is focused on an implementation of the research paper [\"Predicting the direction of stock market prices using random forest\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.00003.pdf), by Luckyson Khaidem, Snehanshu Saha, and Sudeepa Roy Dey.  I hope to gain insights into the accuracy of market technical analysis combined with modern machine learning methods.\nThis tool should not be used as financial advice, but serve merely as offering a display of technical analysis which may offer another perspective on any investments.",
