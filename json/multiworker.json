    "description": "=============\n multiworker\n=============\n\nBackground\n==========\n\nToday's computers are almost always multicore machines. However, due to CPython's GIL, exploiting these multiple cores\nare not simple. The ``multithreading`` module, for instance, are practically rendered impotent as multithreading won't\nhappen unless a thread is being tied up in an I/O operation.\n\nHowever, Python provides a way to actually harness multicore parallelism: The ``multiprocessing`` module.\n\nThe problem with ``multiprocessing`` is that you are given a very 'low-level' plumbing mechanism. It provides you with\ntools to create multiple (sub-)processes, tools to communicate between the (sub-)processes, tools to synchronize\nbetween the (sub-)processes... but that's about it. When you start making programs to harness ``multiprocessing``'s\npowers, you'll quickly find out that you have to keep building the exact same code structure. And along the way, you\nkeep 're-creating the wheel', so to speak.\n\nThis package aims to provide Python programmers with a 'slightly higher level' view of ``multiprocessing``, by removing\nthe necessity of keep having to create the 'harness' code.\n\n*In a nutshell*, this code aims to be to ``multiprocessing`` what ``requests`` did for ``urllib``: Abstracting all the\nplumbing and providing a more intuitive toolset to implement multicore-aware programs.",
