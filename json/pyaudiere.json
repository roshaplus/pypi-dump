    "description": "PyAudiere is a very flexible and easy to use audio library.\n        Available methods allow you to read soundfiles of various formats\n        into memory and play them, or stream them if they are large. You\n        can pass sound buffers as NumPy arrays of float32's to play\n        (non-blocking). You can also create pure tones, square waves, or\n        'on-line' white or pink noise. All of these functions can\n        be utilized concurrently. Sweet!",
