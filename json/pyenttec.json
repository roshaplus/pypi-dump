    "description": "Python module for sending DMX using the Enttec Pro (or compatible) DMX port.\r\n\r\nInstall using setuptools.  I'll get this on PyPI at some point.\r\n\r\nIn general, this interface attempts to be as pythonic as possible.  Since rendering\r\nDMX is a real-time operation, the interface is lightweight and does not attempt\r\nto massage out of range inputs (such as DMX values greater than 255).  The client\r\nis expected to supply proper values.\r\n\r\nOn OS X, use is very simple using the select_port function::\r\n\r\n    import pyenttec as dmx\r\n    port = dmx.select_port()\r\n    port.dmx_frame[0] = 123\r\n    port.render()\r\n\r\nOn windows or linux, the select_port function can be modified.  Windows uses\r\nnumbered com ports, and on linux your serial port directory and port name will\r\nprobably be different.  You can also just call the DMXConnection constructor\r\ndirectly with the right argument.\r\n\r\nSupport is included for setting various port parameters such as refresh rate\r\nand universe length.  For certain applications (very fast strobe control,\r\nfor exmaple) using a truncated universe with refresh_rate = 0 permits faster\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nThis module started as bug fixes to the pySimpleDMX package.\r\nhttps://github.com/c0z3n/pySimpleDMX\r\n\r\nIt then mutated into a complete rewrite based on the Objective-C enttec implemention by Coil\r\nhttps://github.com/coil-lighting",
