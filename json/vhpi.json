    "description": "Very Hungry Pi\n==============\n\nNews\n----\n\nVersion 2 (beta) released.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI'm happy to announce Version 2 (beta) of *vhpi*. It's an entire\nrewrite. There is a ``vhpi`` package now on\n`pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/vhpi>`__ and a simple command line\ninterface to run *vhpi* more conveniently. There are some minor breaking\nChanges in the config. The most important thing to notice, if you\nupgrade from v1 to v2, is that the snapshot directories have a new\nnaming convention. ``monthly.1`` would now be\n``2017-10-11__02:07:03__monthly.1``. The timestamp tells you when the\nbackup was finished. If you want to use your current snapshots with v2,\nyou should adjust their names accordingly. See\n`CHANGELOG.md <https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/blob/2.0/CHANGELOG.md>`__\nfor more changes.\n\nContents\n--------\n\n-  `Description <#description>`__\n-  `Features <#features>`__\n-  `Requirements <#requirements>`__\n-  `Example Config <#example_config>`__\n-  `Installation & Configuration <#install>`__\n\n Description\n------------\n\nWith **vhpi** you can turn your Raspberry Pi into a silent backup module\nfor your Network. *Vhpi* creates\n`incremental <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_backup>`__\n`snapshot <https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/wiki/Snapshots-explanation>`__\nbackups of available network shares (e.g.\n`NFS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System>`__,\n`Samba <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)>`__) silently and\nautomated with a minimum of disk space required. *Vhpi* runs entirely on\n'server-side'; clients only need to share/export backup sources with the\nPi and let the Pi run the backups in the background. *Vhpi* uses battle\nproven tools like `rsync <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync>`__ to\ncreate the backups and `cp <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cp_(Unix)>`__\nto create hardlinks for the snapshots. To get the most control over the\nbackups *vhpi* takes raw `rsync\noptions <http://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync>`__ for configuration. *Vhpi*\nwrites two log files: one for a short overview of the entire process\n(`info.log exmpl. <vhpi/examples/info.log>`__) and one for debugging\n(`debug.log exmpl. <vhpi/examples/debug.log>`__).\n\n**TL;DR:** Just setup *vhpi*, run your Pi 24/7 and don't care about\nbackups no more.\n\n Features\n---------\n\n-  *Vhpi* works with any rsync command you like. This gives you a wide\n   and well documented variety of configuration options for your backup.\n-  You can create multiple *exclude-lists* to exclude files/dirs from\n   the backup. (See 'exclude\\_lib' in `Example\n   Config <#example_config>`__)\n-  *Vhpi* creates\n   `snapshots <https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/wiki/Snapshots-explanation>`__\n   for any time-interval you like. (e.g. 'hourly', 'daily', 'weekly',\n   'monthly', 'each-4-hours', 'half-yearly', etc...) Just add the\n   interval name and its duration in seconds to the config. (See\n   'intervals' in `Example Config <#example_config>`__).\n-  You can set the amount of snapshots that you want keep for each used\n   interval. E.g. if you want to keep 3 snapshots for the 'hourly'\n   interval you get three snapshot dirs: ``hourly.0``, ``hourly.1``,\n   ``hourly.2``. Each snapshot reaches an hour further into the past.\n-  Snapshots require a minimum of disk space:\n\n   -  because the backups are created incrementally.\n   -  because *vhpi* creates new snapshots as 'hard links' for all files\n      that haven't changed. (No duplicate files.. just links)\n\n-  The process is nicely logged ('info.log', 'debug.log').\n-  If a backup process takes long, *vhpi* blocks any attempt to start a\n   new backup process until the first one has finished to prevent the Pi\n   from overloading.\n-  More features are planned (See: `Version\n   Overview <https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/wiki/Version-Overview-(TODOs)>`__)\n\n Requirements:\n--------------\n\n-  You need Python >= 3.6 on your Pi for *vhpi* to run. (`How to install\n   Python3.x on your\n   Pi <https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/wiki/Install-Python3.X-from-source-on-a-Raspberry-Pi-(Raspbian)>`__)\n-  The file system of your Backup destination has to support hard links.\n   (most common fs like NTFS and ext do...)\n\n Example Config\n---------------\n\n``~/.config/vhpi/vhpi_cfg.yaml``\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n| \\`\\`\\`yaml\n| # IMPORTANT: If you use paths that contain spaces, make sure to escape\n  them # with \u00a0(backslash).

Just share/export them with ``NFS`` or ``Samba``. Perhaps *vhpi*\ncan create local backups as well.\n\nYou should use ``autofs`` or similar to automatically mount the shared\ndirectories with your Pi whenever they are available. This way your Pi\nwill automatically mount the directories whenever a machine enters the\nnetwork.\n\nThere is a tutorial on this in the wiki: `How to share sources with your\nRaspberry Pi using\nNFS. <https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/wiki/How-to-share-sources-with-your-Raspberry-Pi-using-NFS.>`__\n\nDownload and Install:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSimplest way to install *vhpi* is by useing pip. You need Python3.6 for\n*vhpi* to run. (`How to install Python3.x on your\nPi <https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/wiki/Install-Python3.X-from-source-on-a-Raspberry-Pi-(Raspbian)>`__)\nAfter you installed Python3.6 you can run pip to install *vhpi* like\nthis:\n\n::\n\n    $ pip3.6 install vhpi\n\nRun this command to check if *vhpi* was isntalled successfully:\n\n::\n\n    $ vhpi --help\n\nIt should print the help text to the terminal.\n\nConfigure vhpi:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWhen you run *vhpi* for the first time, it creates a config dir at\n``~/.config/vhpi/``, you'll find a file called ``vhpi_cfg.yaml`` there.\nThis is where you configure your backups. The config file is pretty self\nexplanatory, just have a look at the `Example\nConfig <#example_config>`__\n\nTest the configuration\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn order to test *vhpi* I suggest setting up some dummy backup sources\nthat point to some safe destinations. Maybe in the ``/tmp`` dir or so.\nThen just run the following command a couple of times and see if the\ndestination gets filled with backups/snapshots:\n\n``$ vhpi run``\n\nIf you get an error try to adjust the config. If you think there is a\nbug feel free to use the `github issue\ntracker <https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/issues>`__! The\nresults of each run is written to the log-files as well\n(``~/.config/vhpi/debug.log`` and ``~/.config/vhpi/info.log``)\n\n Create a Cronjob\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can run *vhpi* manually with this command ``vhpi run``, but I\nsuggest creating a cronjob that runs *vhpi* automatically every hour. To\ndo so you can add the following line to ``/etc/crontab``. (Replace\n``username`` with the username that is supposed to run *vhpi*.\n\n::\n\n    @hourly         username   vhpi run\n\n*NOTICE: You can use any time interval you like for the cronjob, but\nkeep in mind that the time interval should be at least as small as the\nsmallest snapshot interval that you use. E.g. if you want to create\nhourly snapshots the cronjob should run *\\ vhpi\\* at least every hour,\notherwise you won't get a snapshot for each hour. You should also keep\nin mind that the more frequently *vhpi* is run by your cronjob, the\nhigher is the chance you get a new backup. E.g. if you use a cronjob\nthat only starts every 24 hours, chances are high that you won't get a\nbackup for several days in a row, because your client machines might be\noffline at the particular time your cronjob fires. So even if your\nsmallest snapshot is supposed to happen daily, you should consider\nmaking the cronjob run *vhpi* each hour or so. That way chances are\nhigher that you get a daily backup.\\* **TL;DR** Just set the cronjob to\nrun *vhpi* hourly.\n\nYou can also add multiple cronjobs that execute *vhpi* in different\nintervals for different users.\n\nAfter you added the cronjob, you should restart your Pi or restart the\ncrontab like this:\n\n::\n\n    $ /etc/init.d/cron restart\n\nIf this is all done, your Pi should run *vhpi* every hour and you should\nsee some activity in the log files and of cause on your hard drive. Yay!\n:D\n",
