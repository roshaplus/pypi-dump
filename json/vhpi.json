    "description": "# Very Hungry Pi\n<img src=\"assets/slideshow.gif\" alt=\"slideshow\" />\n\n## News\n\n### Version 2 (beta) released.\n\nI'm happy to announce Version 2 (beta) of *vhpi*.\nIt's an entire rewrite. There is a `vhpi` package now on [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/vhpi) and a simple command line interface to run *vhpi* more conveniently. There are some minor breaking Changes in the config. The most important thing to notice, if you upgrade from v1 to v2, is that the snapshot directories have a new naming convention. `monthly.1` would now be `2017-10-11__02:07:03__monthly.1`. The timestamp tells you when the backup was finished. If you want to use your current snapshots with v2, you should adjust their names accordingly. See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/blob/2.0/CHANGELOG.md) for more changes.\n\n## Contents\n* [Description](#description)\n* [Features](#features)\n* [Requirements](#requirements)\n* [Example Config](#example_config)\n* [Installation & Configuration](#install)\n\n## <a name=\"description\"></a> Description\nWith **vhpi** you can turn your Raspberry Pi into a silent backup module for your Network.\n*Vhpi* creates [incremental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_backup) [snapshot](https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/wiki/Snapshots-explanation) backups of available network shares (e.g. [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System), [Samba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software))) silently and automated with a minimum of disk space required.\n*Vhpi* runs entirely on 'server-side'; clients only need to share/export backup sources with the Pi and let the Pi run the backups in the background. \n*Vhpi* uses battle proven tools like [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) to create the backups and [cp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cp_(Unix)) to create hardlinks for the snapshots. \nTo get the most control over the backups *vhpi* takes raw [rsync options](http://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) for configuration.\n*Vhpi* writes two log files: one for a short overview of the entire process ([info.log exmpl.](vhpi/examples/info.log)) and one for debugging ([debug.log exmpl.](vhpi/examples/debug.log)).\n\n\n**TL;DR:** Just setup *vhpi*, run your Pi 24/7 and don't care about backups no more.\n<br>\n\n## <a name=\"features\"></a> Features\n\n* *Vhpi* works with any rsync command you like. This gives you a wide and well documented variety of configuration options for your backup.\n* You can create multiple *exclude-lists* to exclude files/dirs from the backup. (See 'exclude_lib' in [Example Config](#example_config))\n* *Vhpi* creates [snapshots](https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/wiki/Snapshots-explanation) for any time-interval you like. (e.g. 'hourly', 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly', 'each-4-hours', 'half-yearly', etc...) Just add the interval name and its duration in seconds to the config. (See 'intervals' in [Example Config](#example_config)).\n* You can set the amount of snapshots that you want keep for each used interval.\n    E.g. if you want to keep 3 snapshots for the 'hourly' interval you get three snapshot dirs: `hourly.0`, `hourly.1`, `hourly.2`. Each snapshot reaches an hour further into the past.\n* Snapshots require a minimum of disk space:\n    * because the backups are created incrementally. \n    * because *vhpi* creates new snapshots as 'hard links' for all files that haven't changed. (No duplicate files.. just links)\n* The process is nicely logged ('info.log', 'debug.log').\n* If a backup process takes long, *vhpi* blocks any attempt to start a new backup process until the first one has finished to prevent the Pi from overloading.\n* More features are planned (See: [Version Overview](https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/wiki/Version-Overview-(TODOs)))\n\n## <a name=\"requirements\"></a> Requirements:\n\n* You need Python >= 3.6 on your Pi for *vhpi* to run. ([How to install Python3.x on your Pi](https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/wiki/Install-Python3.X-from-source-on-a-Raspberry-Pi-(Raspbian)))\n* The file system of your Backup destination has to support hard links. (most common fs like NTFS and ext do...)\n\n## <a name=\"install\"></a> Installation & Configuration\n\n\n### Sharing sources with the Pi:\n\nYour Pi needs access to the directories of each client that you want to backup. Just share/export them with `NFS` or `Samba`. Perhaps *vhpi* can create local backups as well.\n\nYou should use `autofs` or similar to automatically mount the shared directories with your Pi whenever they are available. This way your Pi will automatically mount the directories whenever a machine enters the network.\n\nThere is a tutorial on this in the wiki: [How to share sources with your Raspberry Pi using NFS.](https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/wiki/How-to-share-sources-with-your-Raspberry-Pi-using-NFS.)\n\n\n### Download and Install:\n\nSimplest way to install *vhpi* is by useing pip. You need Python3.6 for *vhpi* to run. ([How to install Python3.x on your Pi](https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/wiki/Install-Python3.X-from-source-on-a-Raspberry-Pi-(Raspbian)))\nAfter you installed Python3.6 you can run pip to install *vhpi* like this:\n```\n$ pip3.6 install vhpi\n```\n\nRun this command to check if *vhpi* was isntalled successfully:\n\n```\n$ vhpi --help\n```\nIt should print the help text to the terminal.\n\n\n### Configure vhpi:\n\nWhen you run *vhpi* for the first time, it creates a config dir at `~/.config/vhpi/`, you'll find a file called `vhpi_cfg.yaml` there. This is where you configure your backups. The config file is pretty self explanatory, just have a look at the [Example Config](#example_config)\n\n\n### Test the configuration \n\nIn order to test *vhpi* I suggest setting up some dummy backup sources that point to some safe destinations. Maybe in the `/tmp` dir or so. Then run the following command a couple of times and see if the destination gets filled with backups/snapshots:\n\n ```\n $ vhpi run\n ```\n \nIf you get an error try to adjust the config. If you think there is a bug feel free to use the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/issues)!\nThe results of each run is written to the log-files as well (`~/.config/vhpi/debug.log` and `~/.config/vhpi/info.log`)\n\n### <a name=\"create_cronjob\"></a> Create a Cronjob\n\nYou can run *vhpi* manually with this command `vhpi run`, but I suggest creating a cronjob that runs *vhpi* automatically every hour. To do so you can add the following line to `/etc/crontab`. (Replace `username` with the username that is supposed to run *vhpi*.)\n\n```\n@hourly         username   vhpi run\n```\n\nIf want to set the cronjob to something else than *hourly*, you might want to read this: [Choosing an interval for the cornjob.](https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/wiki/Choosing-an-interval-for-the-cronjob.)\n\nYou can also add multiple cronjobs that execute *vhpi* in different intervals for different users.\n\nAfter you added the cronjob, you should restart your Pi or restart the crontab like this:\n\n```\n$ /etc/init.d/cron restart\n```\n\nIf this is all done, your Pi should run *vhpi* every hour and you should see some activity in the log files and of cause on your hard drive. Yay! :D\n\n\n\n## <a name=\"example_config\"></a> Example Config\n\n#### `~/.config/vhpi/vhpi_cfg.yaml`\n\n ```yaml  \n# IMPORTANT: If you use paths that contain spaces, make sure to escape them \n# with \\ (backslash).
