    "description": "Package requirements checker\n============================\n\nThis module provides a plug-in for `flake8 <http://flake8.pycqa.org>`_, which checks/validates\npackage import requirements. It reports missing and/or not used project direct dependencies.\n\nThis plug-in adds new flake8 warnings:\n\n- ``I900``: Package is not listed as a requirement.\n- ``I901``: Package is require but not used.\n\nImportant notice\n----------------\n\nIn order to collect project's dependencies, this checker evaluates Python code from the\n``setup.py`` file stored in the project's root directory. Code evaluation is done with the\n`eval() <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval>`_ function.\n\nAt this point it is very important to be aware of the consequences of the above approach. One\nmight inject malicious code into the ``setup.py`` file, which will be executed by this checker.\nHence, this checker shall NEVER be use to check code from an unknown source! However, in most\ncases, one validates code from a known source (e.g. own code) and one will run script stored in\nthe ``setup.py`` file anyway. The worst case scenario is, that this checker will execute the\nequivalent of the ``python setup.py``, which shall be idempotent (it's a horribly designed\n``setup.py`` file if it's not).\n\nIf you have noticed some side effects during the ``flake8`` check and your ``setup.py`` file is\nwritten in a standard way (e.g. `pypa-sampleproject\n<https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/blob/master/setup.py>`_), please fill out a bug report.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can install, upgrade, or uninstall ``flake8-requirements`` with these commands::\n\n  $ pip install flake8-requirements\n  $ pip install --upgrade flake8-requirements\n  $ pip uninstall flake8-requirements\n\n\n",
