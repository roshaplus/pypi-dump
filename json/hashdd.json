    "description": "# hashdd\n\npyhashdd is a library for building and using hash databases. It also serves as the client library for interacting with the [hashdd.com](https://www.hashdd.com) [API](https://github.com/hashdd/api_documentation), an online hash database. \n\n# Installation\n\nWith all prerequisites installed, you can install pyhashdd with `pip`:\n\n```\npip install hashdd\n```\n\n## Prerequisites \n\n### Ubuntu\n```\nsudo apt-get install libfuzzy-dev libmhash-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev\n```\n\n### OSX/Darwin Prerequisites\n```\nbrew install ssdeep\n```\n\n**Note: ** Due to a [bug in py-mhash](https://github.com/niwinz/py-mhash/pull/4), pyhashdd on OSX may cause a free error when generating certain hash types. As a workaround until the maintainer accepts the open pull request, please install from this repository:\n\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/brad-anton/py-mhash.git\n```\n\n# Command Line Examples\n\nTo calculate the hash of a specific file (`-f sample`) and look it up (`-l`) in the hashdd.com database:\n```\nhashdd -l -f sample.exe\n```\n\nTo recusively (`-r goodfiles/`) calculate the SHA256 hashes of files in the `goodfiles/` directory and add those hashes to a new bloom filter (the bloom filter is stored in `hashdd.bloom`): \n\n```\nhashdd -b -r goodfiles/\n```\n\nWith the bloom filter created, the `-b` option now compares calculated hashes to the bloom. To calculate the SHA256 hash of `sample.exe` (`-f sample.exe`) and check if it is within the bloom filter (`-b`):\n\n```\nhashdd -b -f sample.exe\n```\n\nTo calculate all hashes (`--all`) and output them to the screen (`-s`):\n```\nhashdd -s -f sample.exe --all\n```\n\nTo calculate a specific hash type:\n```\nhashdd -s -f sample.exe -a md5w\n```\n\n# Library Examples\n\nTo hash a file using all algorithms and features, then store the results in Mongo:\n\n```\n>>> from hashdd import hashdd\n>>> h = hashdd(filename='sample.exe')\n>>> from pymongo import MongoClient\n>>> db = MongoClient().hashdd\n>>> db.hashes.insert_one(h.result)\n```\n\n# API Client Examples\n\nTo query the hashdd.com API for a basic status:\n\n```\n>>> from hashdd.api import client\n>>> c = client(None) # Basic status does not require an api_key, thus the None argument\n>>> c.status('39E1D81353B1002E5043317CE75FA966FDD8DB215E57BC6F72681673CDDA561C')\n{u'39E1D81353B1002E5043317CE75FA966FDD8DB215E57BC6F72681673CDDA561C': {u'known_level': 1, u'result': u'SUCCESS'}, u'result': u'SUCCESS'}\n```",
