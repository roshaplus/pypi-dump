So, if you're using the `python` script instead of the `windows binary` of this script, then you'll need to get things ready first. Follow the instructions mentioned below, according to your OS.\r\n\r\n### Linux/Debian :\r\nSince most (if not all) Linux/Debian OS come with python pre-installed, you don't have to install python manually. Make sure you're using python >= 2.7.x though.\r\n\r\nWe need `pip` to install any external dependenc(ies). So, open any terminal and type in `pip list` and if it shows some data, then it is fine. But, if it shows error, like `pip not found` or something along this line, then you need to install `pip`. Just type this command in terminal :\r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get install python-pip`\r\n\r\nIf you're on Fedora, CentOS/RHEL, openSUSE, Arch Linux, then you simply need to follow [`THIS TUTORIAL`](https://packaging.python.org/install_requirements_linux/) to install `pip`.\r\n\r\nIf this still doesn't work, then you'll manually need to install pip. Doing so is an easy one time job and you can follow   [`THIS TUTORIAL`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) to do so.\r\n\r\nWe need `PhantomJS` to access some websites. So, after all this, we'll install PhantomJS.\r\n\r\nFirst, make sure your system is updated :\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\nsudo apt-get install build-essential chrpath libssl-dev libxft-dev\r\n```\r\nGrab Dependencies for PhantomJS (most important) :\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev\r\nsudo apt-get install libfontconfig1 libfontconfig1-dev\r\n```\r\nGrab the suitable `tar.bz2` file from this [link](http://phantomjs.org/download.html)\r\nExtract the contents of this `tar.bz2` file you just downloaded. Open a terminal and follow the commands. \r\n* Don't forget the change the name of the file(s) mentioned here with the ones that you downloaded.There might be a newer version when you download\r\n```\r\ncd /Name/of_the/directory/that/contains/the/tar_bz2/file\r\nexport PHANTOM_JS=\"phantomjs-2.1.1-linux-x86_64\"\r\nsudo tar xvjf $PHANTOM_JS.tar.bz2\r\n```\r\nOnce downloaded, move Phantomjs folder to /usr/local/share/ and create a symlink:\r\n```\r\nsudo mv $PHANTOM_JS /usr/local/share\r\nsudo ln -sf /usr/local/share/$PHANTOM_JS/bin/phantomjs /usr/local/bin\r\n```\r\nIf none of these commands gave error(s), PhantomJS should be installed in your Linux/Debian systems just fine. You can check it by entering this command in any terminal :\r\n```\r\nphantomjs --version\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Windows :\r\nIf you're on windows, then it is recommended to download the [`windows binary`](https://github.com/Xonshiz/comic-dl#windows-binary) for this script. If you use the windows binary, you don't need to install anything. But, if for some weird reason you want to use Python script instead, then follow these steps :\r\n\r\n* Install Python > 2.7.6. Download the desired installer from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\r\n* [Add it in the system path](http://superuser.com/questions/143119/how-to-add-python-to-the-windows-path) (if not already added).\r\n* If you're using python >2.7.9, you don't need to install `PIP`. However, if you don't have pip installed and added in windows path, then do so by following [this little tutorial](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12476379).\r\n* Download [this `text`]() file and put it in some directory/folder.\r\n* Open Command Prompt and browse to the directory where you downloaded your requiremenets.txt file and run this command :\r\n```\r\npip install -r requirements.txt\r\n```\r\n* It should install the required external libraries.\r\n* Download PhantomJS : http://phantomjs.org/download.html\r\n\r\nWell, if everything came up good without any error(s), then you're good to go!\r\n\r\n### Mac OS X :\r\nMac OS X users will have to fetch their version of `Python` and `Pip`.\r\n* Python installation guide : http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/\r\n* Pip installation guide : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17271319/installing-pip-on-mac-os-x\r\n* PhantomJS Mac Binary : http://phantomjs.org/download.html (Download the latest build for your OS)\r\n\r\nAfter downloading and installing these, you need to add PIP & Python in your path. Follow [`THIS LITTLE GUIDE`](http://www.pyladies.com/blog/Get-Your-Mac-Ready-for-Python-Programming/) to install both, Python & pip successfully.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nAfter installing and setting up all the dependencies in your Operating System, you're good to go and use this script.\r\nThe instructions for all the OS would remain same. Download [`THIS REPOSITORY`](https://github.com/Xonshiz/comic-dl/archive/master.zip) and put it somewhere in your system. Move over the `comic_dl` folder.\r\n\r\n**Windows users**, it's better to not place it places where it requires administrator privileges. Good example would be `C:\\Windows`. This goes for both, the Python script and the windows binary file (.exe).\r\n\r\n**Linux/Debian** users make sure that this script is executable.just run this command, if you run into problem(s) :\r\n\r\n`chmod +x comic-dl.py`\r\n\r\nand then, execute with this :\r\n\r\n`./comic-dl.py`\r\n\r\n## Python Support\r\nThis script supports both, Python 3 and Python 2.\r\n\r\n## Windows Binary\r\nIt is recommended that windows users use this binary to save both, your head and time from installing all the dependencies. \r\n\r\nYou need to download [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/download.html) and keep it in the same directory as that of this windows binary file or you need to have PhantomJS in your path. PhantomJS is required for some websites, which you can check in the [list of supported sites](https://github.com/Xonshiz/comic-dl/blob/master/Supported_Sites.md).\r\n\r\nIf you already have it, then you can download this binary and start using the script right off the bat :\r\n* `Binary (x86)` : [Click Here](https://github.com/Xonshiz/comic-dl/releases/latest)\r\n\r\n\r\n## List of Arguments\r\nCurrently, the script supports these arguments :\r\n```\r\n-h, --help                             Prints the basic help menu of the script and exits.\r\n-i,--input                             Defines the input link to the comic/manga.\r\n-V,--version                           Prints the VERSION and exits.\r\n-a,--about                             Prints ABOUT and USAGE of the script and exits.\r\n-u,--username                          Indicates username for a website.\r\n-p,--password                          Indicates password for a website.\r\n-v,--verbose                           Enables Verbose logging.\r\n```\r\n#### Note :\r\nSome websites like bato.to don't let you view some pages if you're not logged in. You'll have to create an account and pass the login information to the script via `-p` and `-u` arguments.\r\n\r\n## Youtube Tutorial\r\n[![Check The YouTube Tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/TmQYhLHEZxA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmQYhLHEZxA)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nWith this script, you have to pass arguments in order to be able to download anything. Passing arguments in a script is pretty easy. Since the script is pretty basic, it doesn't have too many arguments. Go check the [`ARGUMENTS SECTION`](https://github.com/Xonshiz/comic-dl#list-of-arguments) to know more about which arguments the script offers.\r\n\r\nFollow the instructions according to your OS :\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\nAfter you've saved this script in a directory/folder, you need to open `command prompt` and browse to that directory and then execute the script. Let's do it step by step :\r\n* Open the folder where you've downloaded the files of this repository.\r\n* Hold down the **`SHIFT`** key and while holding down the SHIFT key, **`RIGHT CLICK`** and select `Open Command Prompy Here` from the options that show up.\r\n* Now, in the command prompt, type this :\r\n\r\n*If you're using the windows binary :*\r\n\r\n`comic-dl.exe -i <URL TO THE COMIC>`\r\n\r\n*If you're using the Python Script :*\r\n\r\n`comic-dl.py -i <URL TO THE COMIC>`\r\n\r\nURL can be any URL of the [supported websites](https://github.com/Xonshiz/comic-dl/blob/master/Supported_Sites.md).\r\n\r\n### Linux/Debian\r\nAfter you've saved this script in a directory/folder, you need to open `command prompt` and browse to that directory and then execute the script. Let's do it step by step :\r\n* Open a terminal, `Ctrl + Alt + T` is the shortcut to do so (if you didn't know).\r\n* Now, change the current working directory of the terminal to the one where you've downloaded this repository.\r\n* Now, in the Terminal, type this :\r\n\r\n`comic-dl.py -i <URL TO THE COMIC>`\r\n\r\nURL can be any URL of the [supported websites](https://github.com/Xonshiz/comic-dl/blob/master/Supported_Sites.md).\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nThis is a very basic and small sript, so at the moment it only have a few features.\r\n* Downloads a Single Chapter and puts in a directory with the comic name, volume and chapter.\r\n* Downloads all the chapters available for a series.\r\n* Skip if the file has already been downloaded.\r\n* Show human readable error(s) in most places.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\nYou can check the changelog [**`HERE`**](https://github.com/Xonshiz/comic-dl/blob/master/Changelog.md).\r\n\r\n## Opening An Issue/Requesting A Site\r\nIf your're planning to open an issue for the script or ask for a new feature or anything that requires opening an Issue, then please do keep these things in mind.\r\n\r\n### Reporting Issues\r\nIf you're going to report an issue, then please run the script again with the \"-v or --verbose\" argument. It should generate a file in the same directory, with the name \"Error Log.log\". Copy that log file's data and post it on a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and share that gist's link while reporting the issue here.\r\n\r\nIf you don't include the verbose log, there are chances it'll take time to fix the issue(s) you're having.\r\n \r\n### Suggesting A Feature\r\nIf you're here to make suggestions, please follow the basic syntax to post a request :\r\n\r\n**Subject** : Something that briefly tells us about the feature.\r\n\r\n**Long Explanation** : Describe in details what you want and how you want.\r\n\r\nThis should be enough, but it'll be great if you can add more ;)\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\ncomic.naver.com has korean characters and some OS won't handle those characters. So, instead of naming the file folder with the series name in korean, the script will download and name the folder with the comic's ID instead.",
