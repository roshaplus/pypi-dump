    "description": "spamsum is a fuzzy hash specifically designed for hashing email messages\r\n        to detect if they are SPAM. The spamsum utility includes the ability to\r\n        generate the spamsum hash and check a new message against a existing set\r\n        of hashes to find a match.\r\n        \r\n        pyspamsum is a Python wrapper for the core API of spamsum.\r\n        \r\n        The original spamsum code has been licensed under the terms of the\r\n        the Perl Artistic License. It has been slightly modified to remove\r\n        a special case for small window size checksums.\r\n        \r\n        The original code is Copyright Andrew Tridgell <tridge@samba.org> 2002.\r\n        It forms part of Andrew's junkcode, and is available here:\r\n        \r\n        http://www.samba.org/junkcode/#spamsum\r\n        \r\n        The spamsum code in this project is derived from an updated version that\r\n        was published at Linux.conf.au 2004:\r\n        \r\n        http://linux.anu.edu.au/linux.conf.au/2004/papers/junkcode/spamsum\r\n        \r\n        For details on spamsum itself, please see the spamsum README:\r\n        \r\n        http://samba.org/ftp/unpacked/junkcode/spamsum/README",
