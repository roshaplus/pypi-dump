    "description": "Filework\n========\n\nFileWork is a class for simplifying work with files.  Most of the tedious code for working with a file is contained in \nthe class, so the calling code doesn't need to bother with it.\n\nA FileWork object can:\n\n1. Create a file\n2. Write to a File\n3. Append content to a File\n4. Read the entire contents of a File\n5. Read a file one line at a time\n6. Open or Close the Connection to a File\n7. Delete a File\n\nThere is sphinx-generated documentation: the main page is docs/html/index.html. Included in the documentation is a Usage\nfile (docs/html/usage.html) which provides a simple and hopefully helpful explanation about how the methods work and how\nto call them.\n\nThis module was originally created for the waxtablet application.  \n\nAfter installation of this package is complete, trying to use the module might result in the following error: \"ImportError: No module named sqlitemgr\"\nor some other error message.\n\nThis probably indicates that the Python interpreter may not be able to locate the module.  In this case,\nthe following is recommended:\n\n\tOn Linux:\n\n\t\tLocate where the package was installed.  In the terminal, navigate to the root directory and execute the following command:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsudo find . -name sqlitemgr.py\n\n\n\t\tThis should give a path to the sqlitemgr.py file.  \n\t\tCreate a file called \"local_python.sh\" and put the following text in it:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPYTHONPATH=\"/usr/local/lib/python*.*/dist-packages/sqlitemgr/\":\"${PYTHONPATH}\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texport PYTHONPATH\n\n\t\tTo make the module available to all users, place this file in /etc/profile.d.  Then place a line to execute this\n\t\tfile somewhere in .bashrc or one of the other bash configuration files in the individual (non-root) user's terminal: \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    . /etc/profile.d/local_python.sh\n\n\t\tThis should cause the python interpreter to locate the sqlitemgr.py file in the module.   \n\n\n\n\n\n",
