Go to Timesheets > My Timesheets > Detailed Activities.\n#. Create a new record.\n#. If you don't select any \"Project\", you will be able to select any \"Issue\",\n   opened or not.\n#. Selecting an \"Issue\", the corresponding \"Project\" is filled.\n#. Selecting a \"Project\", \"Issues\" are filtered for only allowing\n   to select opened issues for that project. Remember that an opened issue is\n   an issue whose stage doesn't have \"Closed\" mark checked.\n#. At the end of the line, you will see an stop icon.\n#. When you press this button, the difference between \"Date\" field and the\n   current time, writing this in the field \"Duration\".\n#. You can modify the \"Date\" field for altering the computation of the\n   duration.\n\nor via issues:\n\n#. Go to Project > Search > Issues.\n#. Click on one existing issue or create a new one.\n#. On the \"Timesheets\" page, you will be able to handle records the same way\n   as you do in the above explanation (except the issue selection part, which\n   in this case doesn't appear as it's the current one).\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/140/10.0\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/project/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and\nwelcomed feedback `here <https://github.com/OCA/project/issues/new>`_.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nContributors\n------------\n* Pedro M.
