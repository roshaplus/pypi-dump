    "summary": "Enipy is a new set of python tools developed by Earth Networks to speed up analyzing large amount of weather data.  These tools were originally developed for internal use by the Earth Networks R&D department to speed up building proofs of concepts, and conducting case studies.  Currently, enipy supports Earth Networks lightning data, including reading and writing detection reports, opening real-time data feeds, reading and correlating raw waveform data, and visualizing the data.  The tools fully support, and have been used for, the analysis of very large data sets of 600 million lightning flashes or more.  Enipy is under continuous development by the Earth Networks R&D team, with features being added regularly.  The eventual goal is for these tools to support all Earth Networks data products.  As the tools should be generally useful to the community at large, they have been open-sourced under a very permissive the MIT license.",
