    "description": "GOcats\n======\n\n`GOcats` is an Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) parser and categorizing utility--currently specialized for the Gene\nOntology (GO)--which can help scientists interpret large-scale experimental results by organizing redundant and highly-\nspecific annotations into customizable, biologically-relevant concept categories. Concept subgraphs are defined by lists\nof keywords created by the user.\n\nCurrently, the `GOcats` package can be used to:\n   * Create subgraphs of GO which each represent a user-specified concept.\n   * Map specific, or fine-grained, GO terms in a Gene Annotation File (GAF) to an arbitrary number of concept\n     categories.\n   * Explore the Gene Ontology graph within a Python interpreter.\n\nCitation\n~~~~~~~~\nPlease cite the GitHub repository until our manuscript is accepted for publication: https://github.com/MoseleyBioinformaticsLab/GOcats.git\n\nInstallation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n`GOcats` runs under Python 3.4+, clone the git repo and install the following dependencies and you are ready to go!\n\nInstall on Linux\n----------------\n\nDependency installation\n.......................\n\nGOcats requires JSONPickle and docopt:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   pip3 install docopt\n   pip3 install jsonpickle\n\nPackage installation\n....................\n\nMake sure you have git_ installed:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   cd ~/\n   git clone https://github.com/MoseleyBioinformaticsLab/GOcats.git\n\nInstall on Windows\n------------------\nWindows version not yet available; sorry about that.\n\nQuickstart\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFor instructions on how to format your keyword list and advanced argument usage, consult the `tutorial <doc/tutorial.rst>`_, `guide <doc/guide.rst>`_, and `API <doc/api.rst>`_\n\nSubgraphs can be created from the command line. Either navigate to the GOcats directory or add the directory to your\nPYTHONPATH:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   python3 -m gocats create_subgraphs /path_to_ontology_file ~/GOcats/gocats/exampledata/examplecategories.csv ~/Output --supergraph_namespace=cellular_component --subgraph_namespace=cellular_component --output_termlist\n\nMapping files can be found in the output directory:\n\n   - GC_content_mapping.json_pickle  # A python dictionary with category-defining GO terms as keys and a list of all subgraph contents as values.\n   - GC_id_mapping.json_pickle  # A python dictionary with every GO term of the specified namespace as keys and a list of category root terms as values.\n\nGAF mappings can also be made from the command line:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   python3 -m gocats categorize_dataset YOUR_GAF.goa YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/GC_id_mapping.json_pickle YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY MAPPED_GAF_NAME.goa\n\n\nLicense\n~~~~~~~\n\nMade available under the terms of The Clear BSD License.
