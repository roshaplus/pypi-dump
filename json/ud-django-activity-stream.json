The object that performed the activity.\n * ``Verb``. The verb phrase that identifies the action of the activity.\n * ``Action Object``. *(Optional)* The object linked to the action itself.\n * ``Target``. *(Optional)* The object to which the activity was performed.\n\n``Actor``, ``Action Object`` and ``Target`` are `GenericForeignKeys <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/contenttypes/#django.contrib.contenttypes.fields.GenericForeignKey>`_ to any arbitrary Django object and so can represent any Django model in your project.\nAn action is a description of an action that was performed (``Verb``) at some instant in time by some ``Actor`` on some optional ``Target`` that results in an ``Action Object`` getting created/updated/deleted.\n\nFor example: `justquick <https://github.com/justquick/>`_ ``(actor)`` *closed* ``(verb)`` `issue 2 <https://github.com/justquick/django-activity-stream/issues/2>`_ ``(object)`` on `django-activity-stream <https://github.com/justquick/django-activity-stream/>`_ ``(target)`` 12 hours ago\n\nNomenclature of this specification is based on the Activity Streams Spec: `<http://activitystrea.ms/>`_\n\nFor complete documenation see `Django Activity Stream Documentation <https://django-activity-stream.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_",
