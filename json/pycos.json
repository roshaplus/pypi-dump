    "description": "pycos\n######\n\n`pycos <https://pycos.sourceforge.io>`_ is a Python framework for asynchronous,\nconcurrent, distributed programming with tasks, asynchronous completions and\nmessage passing.\n\nUnlike with other asynchronous frameworks, programs developed with pycos have\n**same logic and structure** as programs with threads, except for a few\nsyntactic changes - mostly using *yield* with asynchronous completions that give\ncontrol to pycos's scheduler, which interleaves executions of tasks, similar to\nthe way an operating system executes multiple processes. In addition, pycos has\nmany additional features, including message passing for communication,\ndistributed computing/programming etc.\n\nUnlike threads, creating tasks with pycos is very efficient. Moreover, with\npycos context switch occurs only when tasks use *yield* (typically with an\nasychronous call), so there is no need for locking and there is no overhead of\nunnecessary context switches.\n\npycos works with Python versions 2.7+ and 3.1+. It has been tested with\nLinux, Mac OS X and Windows; it may work on other platforms, too.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* No callbacks or event loops! No need to lock critical sections either,\n\n* Efficient polling mechanisms epoll, kqueue, /dev/poll, Windows\n  I/O Completion Ports (IOCP) for high performance and\n  scalability,\n\n* Asynchronous (non-blocking) sockets and pipes, for concurrent\n  processing of I/O,\n\n* SSL for security,\n\n* Asynchronous locking primitives similar to Python threading module,\n\n* Asynchronous timers and timeouts,\n\n* `Message passing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing>`_\n  for (local and remote) tasks to exchange messages one-to-one\n  with `Message Queue Pattern\n  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue>`_ or through\n  broadcasting channels with `Publish-Subscribe Pattern\n  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish/subscribe>`_,\n\n* `Location transparency\n  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location_transparency>`_ with naming\n  and locating (local and remote) resources,\n\n* Distributing computation components (code and data) for execution of\n  distributed communicating processes, for wide range of use cases, covering\n  `SIMD, MISD, MIMD <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn%27s_taxonomy>`_ system\n  architectures at the process level, `web interface\n  <https://pycos.sourceforge.io/dispycos.html#client-browser-interface>`_ to\n  monitor cluster/application status/performance; `in-memory processing\n  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-memory_processing>`_, data streaming,\n  real-time (live) analytics and cloud computing are supported as well,\n\n* Monitoring and restarting of (local or remote) tasks, for fault detection\n  and fault-tolerance,\n\n* Hot-swapping of task functions, for dynamic system reconfiguration,\n\n* Thread pools with asynchronous task completions, for executing (external)\n  synchronous tasks, such as reading standard input.\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\npycos is implemented with standard modules in Python.\n\nIf `psutil <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psutil>`_ is available on nodes, node\navailability status (CPU, memory and disk) is sent in status messages, and shown\nin web browser so node/application performance can be monitored.\n\nUnder Windows efficient polling notifier I/O Completion Ports (IOCP) is\nsupported only if `pywin32\n<http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/>`_ is available;\notherwise, inefficient *select* notifier is used.\n\nInstallation\n------------\nTo install pycos, run::\n\n   python -m pip install pycos\n\nAuthors\n-------\n* Giridhar Pemmasani\n\nLinks\n-----\n* `Project page <https://pycos.sourceforge.io>`_.\n* `GitHub (Code Repository) <https://github.com/pgiri/pycos>`_.",
