    "description": "This python module makes it possible to add new attributes to built-in\ntypes, enabling the user to modify types implemented in C, which is not\npossible from Python code.\n\nThe code doing the monkey patching is in ext/_ext.c. It basically adds\na new attribute to a built-in type's __dict__, and then calls\nPyType_Modified on the type. This way it is possible to add new methods\n(implemented in Python or C) or other class attributes to built-in types\n(like list).\nThe module is experimental. I'm not sure which problems can result from\nmodifying the dict of a built-in type.\nThe module doesn't allow replacing an existing attribute of a type, so it\nis harder to render unusable the built-in types. The monkey patching also\nworks on types implemented in Python (it just calls setattr after checking\nif there is already an attribute with the given name).",
