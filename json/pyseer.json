    "description": "pyseer\n======\n\n[SEER](https://github.com/johnlees/seer), reimplemented in python by\n[Marco Galardini](https://github.com/mgalardini) and [John Lees](https://github.com/johnlees)\n\n    pyseer kmers.gz phenotypes.tsv structure.tsv --min-af 0.01 --max-af 0.99 --cpu 15 --filter-pvalue 1E-8\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mgalardini/pyseer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mgalardini/pyseer)\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nKmers-based GWAS analysis is particularly well suited for bacterial samples,\ngiven their high genetic variability. This approach has been for the first\ntime formally implemented by [Lees, Vehkala et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12797),\nin the form of the [SEER](https://github.com/johnlees/seer) software.\n\nThe reimplementation presented here should be consistent with the\ncurrent version of seer. Based on our few\ntests the results are going to be very similar to the\nC++ implementation, though approximation at low p-values may cause small\ndifferences. However, **no guarantee whatsoever is given that the\nscript works in the same way as the original**, especially for corner cases\nand across millions of kmers.\n\nCitation\n--------\n\n``Lees, John A., et al. \"Sequence element enrichment analysis to determine\nthe genetic basis of bacterial phenotypes.\" Nature communications 7 (2016): 12797.``\n\n``doi: 10.1038/ncomms12797``\n\nPrerequisites\n-------------\n\nBetween parenthesis the versions the script was tested against:\n\n* python 3+ (3.5.3)\n* numpy (1.13.3)\n* scipy (1.0.0)\n* pandas (0.21.0)\n* statsmodels (0.8.0)\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nSince everything fits in a script (`pyseer`), you can just place it in your `$PATH`,\nmake it executable (`chmod 755 pyseer`) and type:\n\n    pyseer -h\n\n**Note:** if you wish to use multithreading,\nthe script assumes that your default python's interpreter is at least version 3.\nIf that is not the case then edit the first line to:\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nPopulation structure\n--------------------\n\n`pyseer` accepts as input a tab-delimited square matrix of distances between samples, with\nthe first row and column listing sample names. Such a square matrix can be easily obtained\nby piping the `mash dist` command into the provided `square_mash` script:\n\n    mash dist samples.msh samples.msh | python square_mash > mash.tsv\n\n**Note:** `square_mash` extracts the sample names as the string after the last `/` character\nand up to the first full stop (`.`).\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nWhile waiting on proper unit tests to be implemented, you can check that the script doesn't crash\nby running:\n\n    cd test/ && bash run_test.sh && cd ../\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nSEER's features present in this script:\n\n* binary and continuos phenotypes\n* binary phenotypes: Firth regression upon failure of Newton-Raphson\n* population structure correction\n* MAF filtering\n* kmers prefiltering\n* multi-threading\n* filtering of results based on LRT p-value\n* covariates and intercept betas are reported\n* user-defined covariates (NOTE: still experimental and possibly bugged)\n* automatic determination of binary/continuous phenotypes\n\nAbsent features:\n\n* reasons for failures are not reported\n\nAdditional features:\n\n* Multidimensional scaling from squared [mash](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0997-x) matrix\n* List of samples without the kmer are also output\n\nCopyright\n---------\n\nCopyright (C) <2017> EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as\npublished by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of\nthe License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
