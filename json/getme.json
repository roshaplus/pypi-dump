What if the\nwebsite changes its structure, or we have to extract content from another\nwebsite? You'd likely to rewrite your code over and over again.\n\n**getme** is created to help people minimize that effort. You don't have\nto write code, but need to understand HTML structure enough to extract the\ncontent.\n\n\n.. :changelog:\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n0.0.1 (2013-03-29)\n+++++++++++++++++\n\n- Working Conception\n- Ugly template",
