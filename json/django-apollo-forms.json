    "description": "### What Apollo Is\nAt [Morgan & Morgan](https://www.forthepeople.com/), the development team builds lots of forms. A lot. While most of the\nheavy lifting for form management was done for us by the marketing platform, Hubspot, there were some major gaps that forced us to consider\na switch:\n\n1. Cost. Our Hubspot license was > $50,000 yearly where the only utility came from the form management tooling.\n2. Lack of flexibility. While defining basic validation rules and field layouts was OK, doing anything more complex \n(e.g. email blacklists, geo-based submission filtering, etc.) was impossible. In fact, since their switch to React rendered\nforms, [custom validation in a Hubspot form doesn't work at all](https://integrate.hubspot.com/t/integration-with-jquery-validator-customized-validation/1172/9).\n3. Lack of control. The Hubspot JS library is 300kb+ in size before gzip and sets short-term cache expiration headers. Why? It's hard to say without access to the unminified source.  \n![more than 300kb](http://static.forthepeople.com/engineering/apollo/big_hubspot.png)\n\n\nWith these problems in mind, we built **Apollo** as a solution. \n\nApollo is a Django application which - in conjunction with the [Icarus Javascript Library](https://github.com/Morgan-and-Morgan/icarus) -\naims to act as a plug-and-play solution for the busy engineer. In addition to providing a management interface for building\nform fields, designing forms, and viewing form submissions, Apollo makes the assumption that it should make no assumptions about\ndomain specific requirements of the host application. Thus, it decouples form management from submission processing,\nleaving the job of reacting to events within the host. To facilitate this architecture, Apollo opts for a Pub/Sub design, notifying listeners\non key events like:\n\n* _form submission_\n* _form submission validation_\n* _form submission validation failure_\n\n\n### Why Apollo\nApollo is a hybrid of SASS form services (e.g. Hubspot, Typeform) and tightly integrated framework based applications (e.g. Gravity Forms, WP Forms).\nIt's advantages over these services are three-fold:\n\n1. It is - and always will be - free and open source\n2. It has no dependency on what environment form usage occurs in.\n3. Its powerful and hyper-customizeable form creation interface.\n\n\n### Installation\n```bash\npip install django-apollo\n\n# add the App to the list of INSTALLED_APPS\nINSTALLED_APPS = {\n  ...\n  'apollo'\n  ...\n}\n# run the migrations to generate DB tables\npython manage.py makemigrations apollo\npython manage.py migrate apollo\n\n# collectstatic to generate the static files for the form builder interface\npython manage.py collectstatic\n```\n\n\n### Features\n\n###### Setup field templates for your forms. These define the default configurations for fields and can be overridden on a per-form basis. \n![](http://static.forthepeople.com/engineering/apollo/feature_create_field-min.png)\n\n---\n\n###### Step-by-step form builder interface.\n![](http://static.forthepeople.com/engineering/apollo/feature_create_form_step_1-min.png)\n\n---\n\n###### Powerful layout creator with the ability to apply different layouts for desktop and mobile screens.\n![](http://static.forthepeople.com/engineering/apollo/feature_build_layouts-min.png)\n\n---\n\n\n### Form Usage\nWhen it comes to actually using the forms built by Apollo, you have two options:\n \n1. Use the [Icarus Javascript Library](https://github.com/Morgan-and-Morgan/icarus) (_Recommended_)\n2. DIY.\n\nIf you decide to pursue (2), you'll want to consult the [API guide](https://morgan-and-morgan.github.io/apollo/api) for details on authentication, request format,\nand available queries / mutations.",
