It is very similar to the ``decorating`` package,\nwhich currently has way more features and probably serves you better then\n``clanim``. I wanted to create ``clanim`` anyway as a means of practicing\nwith decorators and command line animations. It doesn't seem like ``decorating`` \ncurrently supports async functions, so that's the one area where ``clanim`` \npotentially is superior at this time.\n\nRequirements\n============\nPython 3.6 or higher and the ``daiquiri`` package (used for development and\nwill probably be removed in a final release).\n\nQuickstart\n==========\nThe API for ``clanim`` consists of the ``@animate`` decorator, as well as the\nanimations in ``clanim.animation``. All of these are package level imports,\nso e.g. the ``@animate`` decorator can be accessed like this:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    # option 1\n    import clanim\n\n    @clanim.animate\n    def func():\n        time.sleep(2)\n\n    # option 2\n    from clanim import animate\n\n    @animate\n    def func():\n        time.sleep(2)\n\nThe ``animate`` decorator works both with and without parameters, and supports\nboth regular functions:\n\n.. image:: images/clanim_sync.gif\n    :alt: animate decorator with regular functions\n\nand async functions:\n\n.. image:: images/clanim_async.gif\n    :alt: animate decorator with async functions\n\nInstall\n=======\nOption 1: Install from PyPi with ``pip``\n----------------------------------------\nThe latest release of ``clanim`` is on PyPi, and can thus be installed as usual\nwith ``pip``.  I strongly discourage system-wide ``pip`` installs (i.e. ``sudo\npip install <package>``), as this may land you with incompatible packages in a\nvery short amount of time. A per-user install can be done like this:\n\n1. Execute ``pip install --user clanim`` to install the package.\n2. Further steps to be added ...\n\n\nOption 2: Clone the repo and the install with ``pip``\n-----------------------------------------------------\nIf you want the dev version, you will need to clone the repo, as only release\nversions are uploaded to PyPi. Unless you are planning to work on this\nyourself, I suggest going with the release version.\n\n1. Clone the repo with ``git``:\n    - ``git clone https://github.com/slarse/clanim``\n2. ``cd`` into the project root directory and install with ``pip``.\n    - ``pip install --user .``, this will create a local install for the current user.\n    - Or just ``pip install .`` if you use ``virtualenv``.\n    - For development, use ``pip install -e .`` in a ``virtualenv``.\n3. Further steps to be added ...\n\nLicense\n=======\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.
