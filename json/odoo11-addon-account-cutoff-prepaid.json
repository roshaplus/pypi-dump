It uses the **Start Date** and **End Date** fields of journal entries (copied from the same fields of invoice lines).\n\nFor\nexample, if you have an insurance contrat for your company that run from April\n1st 2013 to March 31st 2014, you will enter these dates as start and end dates\non the supplier invoice line. If your fiscal year ends on December 31st 2013,\n3 months of expenses are part of the 2014 fiscal year and should not be part of\nthe 2013 fiscal year. So, thanks to this module, you will create a *Prepaid\nExpense* on December 31st 2013 and OpenERP will identify this expense with the\n3 months that are after the cut-off date and propose to generate the\nappropriate cut-off journal entry.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nOn the form view of the company, in the *Configuration* tab, there is a *Cut-offs* section where you can configure:\n\n* the *Default Cut-off Journal*, which is the journal in which the cut-off journal items will be generated by default,\n* the *Default Account for Prepaid Revenue*,\n* the *Default Account for Prepaid Expense*.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo compute the prepaid revenue, go to the menu *Accounting > Cut-offs\n> Prepaid Revenue* and click on the *Create* button. Enter the cut-off\ndate, check that the source journals contains all your sale journals\nand click on the button *Re-Generate lines*: Odoo will scan all the\njournal entries of the source journals and will get all the lines that\nhave an end date after the cut-off date and, for each line, it will\ncompute the prepaid revenue. If you agree with the result, click on the\nbutton *Create Journal Entry*: Odoo will generate an account move at the\ncut-off date to cut these prepaid revenue. Hint: you can then use the reversal\nfeature to generate the reverse journal items on the next day.\n\nIf you need to answer a question such as *How much revenue did I already\ninvoice for my next fiscal year ?*, you will be interested by the\n*forecast* feature. For that, on the Prepaid Revenue form, click on\nthe *Forecast* option and you will see 2 new fields: *Start Date* and\n*End Date*. Enter the start date and the end date of your next fiscal\nyear and click on the button *Re-Generate lines*: you will see all the\nrevenue that you already have in your source journals for that period.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/89/11.0\n\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/account-closing/issues>`_.
