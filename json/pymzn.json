    "description": "PyMzn\n=====\n\nPyMzn is a Python library that wraps and enhances the `MiniZinc\n<http://minzinc.org>`__ tools for CSP modelling and solving.  It is built on top\nof the `minizinc <https://github.com/MiniZinc/MiniZincIDE>`__ toolkit and\nprovides a number of off-the-shelf functions to readily solve problems encoded\nin MiniZinc and parse the solutions into Python objects.\n\nUsage\n-----\nFirst, you need a MiniZinc model encoding the problem you want to solve.\nHere is a simple 0-1 knapsack problem encoded with MiniZinc:::\n\n    %% test.mzn %%\n    int: n;                     % number of objects\n    set of int: OBJ = 1..n;\n    int: capacity;              % the capacity of the knapsack\n    array[OBJ] of int: profit;  % the profit of each object\n    array[OBJ] of int: size;    % the size of each object\n\n    var set of OBJ: x;\n    constraint sum(i in x)(size[i]) <= capacity;\n    var int: obj = sum(i in x)(profit[i]);\n    solve maximize obj;\n\n\n    %% test.dzn %%\n    n = 5;\n    profit = [10, 3, 9, 4, 8];\n    size = [14, 4, 10, 6, 9];\n\nYou can solve the above problem using the ``pymzn.minizinc`` function::\n\n    import pymzn\n    pymzn.minizinc('test.mzn', 'test.dzn', data={'capacity': 20})\n\nThe result will be::\n\n    SolnStream(solns=[{'x': {3, 5}}], complete=True)\n\nThe returned object represent a solution stream, which can be directly\nreferenced and iterated as a list. The ``minizinc`` function automatically\nflattens the MiniZinc model, using the provided mzn and dzn files. It executes\nthe solver on the flattened model and parses the solution stream to get the\nsolutions as Python dictionaries.\n\nPyMzn is also able to:\n\n* Convert python objects to `dzn <http://paolodragone.com/pymzn/reference/dzn/>`__ format and back;\n* Interface with `different solvers <http://paolodragone.com/pymzn/reference/solvers/>`__;\n* Perform `dynamic modelling <http://paolodragone.com/pymzn/reference/model/>`__;\n* `Serialize <http://paolodragone.com/pymzn/reference/serialization.html>`__ several instances of one problem;\n* and more ...\n\nFor a follow-up of this example, read the\n`Quick Start guide <http://paolodragone.com/pymzn/quick_start.html>`__.\n\nFor more information on the PyMzn functions read the\n`reference manual <http://paolodragone.com/pymzn/reference/>`__.\n\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nPyMzn can be installed via Pip::\n\n    pip3 install pymzn\n\nor from the source code available\non `GitHub <https://github.com/paolodragone/pymzn>`__::\n\n    python3 setup.py install\n\nCurrently, PyMzn is developed and maintained in Python v3.5 with a\nporting to Python v2.7 at every release (the python2 branch does not always\ncontain the most recent changes).\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\nPyMzn requires some additional software to be installed on your system\nbefore you can use it properly, namely:\n\n* The `MiniZinc toolkit <https://github.com/MiniZinc/MiniZincIDE>`__;\n* A CSP solver compatible with the FlatZinc encoding, e.g. `Gecode <http://www.gecode.org>`__.\n\nYou can use any solver you like, but the default one for PyMzn is `Gecode\n<http://www.gecode.org>`__. If you use the Gecode solver, PyMzn will work\nout-of-the-box. PyMzn also supports most of the solvers included in the MiniZinc\ntoolkit. If the solver you are looking for is not supported by PyMzn you can\nimplement your own interface and use it with little configuration (see the\n`Solvers section <reference/solvers/>`__).\n\nDetailed instructions on how to install *MiniZinc* and *Gecode* can be found in\nthe `Install section <http://paolodragone.com/pymzn/install.html>`__ of the\ndocumentation.\n\n\nContribute\n----------\n\nIf you find a bug or think of a useful feature, please submit an issue on the\n`GitHub page <https://github.com/paolodragone/pymzn/>`__ of PyMzn.\n\nPull requests are very welcome too. If you are interested in contributing to\nthe PyMzn source code, read about its\n`implementation details <http://paolodragone.com/pymzn/reference/internal.html>`__.\nSome things that would be very useful are:\n\n* Implement specific interfaces for not yet supported solvers;\n* Enhance existing ones.\n\n\nHeads up on future changes\n--------------------------\n\nBe aware that this project is still currently under development and thus it is\nnot in a stable version yet. Things in the future *will* certainly change. This\nis especially due to recent changes in the minizinc library, which are\nintroducing lots of new features that could make some of PyMzn's features\nobsolete. At any rate, PyMzn will stay updated to the most recent changes in\nMiniZinc and keep enhancing its python interface.\n\n\nAuthor\n------\n\n`Paolo Dragone <http://paolodragone.com>`__, PhD student at the University of\nTrento.\n",
