    "description": "# PyU4V\r\nA library showing some of the functionality possible using the ReST API of Dell EMC's UniSphere for VMAX.\r\nThis code has been adapted from https://github.com/scottbri/PyVMAX.\r\nGet the Unisphere for VMAX Rest documentation by navigating to https://<ip-address>:<port-number>/univmax/restapi/docs,\r\nwhere <ip-address> = the ip of your Unisphere server and <port-number> = the corresponding port to connect through,\r\neg: https://10.0.0.1:8443/univmax/restapi/docs.\r\n\r\n# WHAT'S SUPPORTED\r\nThis package supports Unisphere version 8.3 onwards, although the calls *should* work on 8.0, 8.1 and 8.2 also.\r\nWe support VMAX3 and VMAX All-Flash (All Flash from 8.3 onwards).\r\n\r\n# INSTALLATION\r\nTo give it a try, install the package using pip (pip install PyU4V). Copy the sample PyU4V.conf into your working\r\ndirectory, and add your server and array details to the top of the PyU4V.conf configuration file, under the [setup]\r\nheading. Alternatively, you can pass some or all of these details on initialisation.\r\nPassword, username, server_ip, port, and array MUST be set (either in the config file or on initialisation).\r\nVerify can be left as is, or you can enable SSL verification by following the directions below\r\n(see SSL CONFIGURATION).\r\n\r\n# SSL CONFIGURATION\r\n1. Get the CA certificate of the Unisphere server.\r\n\t$ openssl s_client -showcerts -connect {server_hostname}:8443 </dev/null 2>/dev/null|openssl x509 -outform PEM > {server_hostname}.lss.emc.com.pem\r\n    (This pulls the CA cert file and saves it as server_hostname.lss.emc.com.pem e.g. esxi01vm01.lss.emc.com.pem)\r\n2.\tCopy the pem file to the system certificate directory\r\n\t$ sudo cp {server_hostname}.lss.emc.com.pem /usr/share/ca-certificates/{server_hostname}.lss.emc.com.lss.emc.com.crt\r\n3. \tUpdate CA certificate database with the following commands\r\n\t$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates (Ensure the new cert file is highlighted)\r\n\t$ sudo update-ca-certificates\r\n4. In the conf file insert the following:\r\n   verify=/path-to-file/irco3sd23vm08.lss.emc.com.pem OR pass the value in on initialization.\r\n\r\n# USAGE\r\nPyU4V could also be used as the backend for a script, or a menu etc. Just import the PyU4V package (import PyU4V),\r\ncreate an instance of rest_functions (e.g. \"rf = PyU4V.rest_functions()\"), and you're good to go.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to query another array without changing the configuration file, call the set_array() function.\r\n\r\n# EXAMPLES\r\nThere are a number of examples which can be run with minimal set-up. For details on how to run these,\r\nand other very useful information, please see Paul Martin's blog https://community.emc.com/people/PaulCork/blog\r\n\r\n# FUTURE\r\nThis is still a work in progress. To be expected in the future:\r\n- Expansion of the rest_functions library (including new Unisphere versions - see below)\r\n- Increased exception handling and logging\r\n- Unittests\r\n\r\n# VERSION FUTURE\r\nThe Rest API is undergoing substantial transformation for the 8.4 release. With that in mind, we will be creating a\r\nnew 84 version when that is released.\r\n\r\n# CONTRIBUTION\r\nPlease do! Create a fork of the project into your own repository. Make all your necessary changes and create a pull\r\nrequest with a description on what was added or removed and details explaining the changes in lines of code.\r\nIf it all looks good, I'll merge it.\r\n\r\n# SUPPORT\r\nPlease file bugs and issues on the Github issues page for this project. This is to help keep track and document\r\neverything related to this repo. For general discussions and further support you can join the {code} Community\r\nslack channel. Lastly, for questions asked on Stackoverflow.com please tag them with EMC. The code and\r\ndocumentation are released with no warranties or SLAs and are intended to be supported through a community driven\r\nprocess.\r\n",
