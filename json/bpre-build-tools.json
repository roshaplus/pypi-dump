    "description": "BPRE Build Tools\n----------------\n\nThis just packages Touched\u2019s insert and build scripts for BPRE for\nsetuptools and pip.\n\nHow to install?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n``pip install bpre-build-tools``\n\nHow to use?\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you\u2019re familar wth Touched/FBI\u2019s C project directory structure,\ncongratulations, you already know how to use this. Because that is\nliterally all this is! Ripped straight from `here`_, they haven\u2019t been\nmodified.\n\nOnce you have installed, they should be added to your PATH. Rather than\ncalling, for example, ``python scripts/build`` you just call\n``bpre-build``. There are two build scripts - ``bpre-build`` and\n``bpre-build2``. There are three insert scripts - ``bpre-insert``,\n``bpre-insert2``, and ``bpre-insert3``. Which one you use will depend on\nhow you set up your environment.\n\nThe build and insert scripts expect a particular project structure to be\nformed by the current working directory. In particular, you should have\na ``hooks`` file, a ``BPRE.ld`` file, a ``linker.ld`` file, and a\n``src`` directory. A minimal project skeleton can be found\n`here <https://github.com/Sagiri/bpre-minimal-skeleton>`__.\n\nThe build scripts take no command line arguments.\n\nThe insert scripts have four command line arguments.\n\n| ``bpre-insert --debug`` will print out all the symbols and where they\n  were inserted.\n| ``bpre-insert --offset 500`` will insert at 500. The argument must be\n  in decimal, and defaults to (the decimal equivalent of) 0x800000.\n| ``bpre-insert --input in.gba --output out.gba`` will read from\n  ``in.gba`` and write to ``out.gba``. They default to ``BPRE0.gba`` and\n  ``test.gba``, respectively.\n\n.. _here: https://github.com/EternalCode/Empty-Template",
