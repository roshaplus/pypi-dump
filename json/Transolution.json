    "description": "Transolution is a Computer Aided Translation (CAT) suite supporting the XLIFF\r\nstandard. It provides the open source community with features and concepts that\r\nhave been used by commercial offerings for years to improve translation\r\nefficiency and quality. The suite is modular to make it flexible and provides an\r\nXLIFF Editor, translation memory engine and filters to convert different formats\r\nto and from XLIFF. The use of XLIFF means that almost any content can be\r\nlocalized as long as there is a filter for it (XML, SGML, PO, RTF,\r\nStarOffice/OpenOffice, etc.).",
