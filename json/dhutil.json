Create this folder and populate it with the desired files.\n\n\nMongoDB\n-------\n\nTo enable MongoDB access, put a ``mongodb_credentials.json`` file in the ``~/.datahack`` folder with the following properties:\n\n.. code-block:: json\n\n  {\n    \"host\": \"ds162883.mlab.com\",\n    \"port\": \"26552\",\n    \"usr\": \"some_user\",\n    \"pwd\": \"pAsswOrd\",\n    \"authSource\": \"db_name\"\n  }\n\nThese are example values; you need to use the database-specific host and port supplied by *mlab*, a username and password of a user created inside that *mlab* database (not the username and password used to log into *mlab*!), and the name of that database as the ``authSource`` parameter.\n\n\nEmail\n-----\n\nTo enable email access, put an ``email_credentials.json`` file in the ``~/.datahack`` folder with the following properties:\n\n.. code-block:: json\n\n  {\n      \"host\": \"smtp.zoho.com\",\n      \"port\": \"587\",\n      \"usr\": \"zoho_username\",\n      \"pwd\": \"wOwPassWord\"\n  }\n\nThese are example values; host and port are correct (for the ZohoMail SMTP server), but you need to put the username and password of the ZohoMail account you want to use to send emails, or put in the details of another SMTP server.\n\n\nUse\n===\n\nWhen you install ``dhutil`` a command (of the corresponding name) giving access to its CLI is installed on your system. Type ``dhutil`` in terminal to get a list of the available sub-commands:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  ~ dhutil\n  Usage: dhutil [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n\n  A command-line interface for dhutil.\n\n  Options:\n    --help  Show this message and exit.\n\n  Commands:\n    mail  Email related commands.\n\n\nmail\n----\n\nSome email-related utilities. Type ``dhutil mail`` in terminal to get a list of the available email-related commands:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  ~ dhutil mail\n  Usage: dhutil mail [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n\n    Email related commands.\n\n  Options:\n    --help  Show this message and exit.\n\n  Commands:\n    confirm_send  Send confirmation emails.\n    confirm_stat  Status of confirmation emails.\n\n\nconfirm_stat\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe ``dhutil mail confirm_stat`` terminal command will print to termintal how many users got *confirmation* emails (not acceptance emails):\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  ~ dhutil mail confirm_stat\n  Emails stas on DataHack 2017 registration:\n  432 total users in the system.\n  415 users got a confirmation email.\n\n\nconfirm_send\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe ``dhutil mail confirm_send`` terminal command will first print to terminal confirmation emails stats, and then will send *confirmation* emails (not acceptance emails) to any registered user who has not gotten one yet, and will mark them as such. Emails are sent with 50 recipents per-email (so not to use up the daily email quota), which are all BCCed so they can't see who else is CCed:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  ~ dhutil mail confirm_send\n  Emails stas on DataHack 2017 registration:\n  250 total users in the system.\n  247 users got a confirmation email.\n  Sending confirmation emails to all non-confirmed users.\n  Sending a confirmation email to the following addresses:\n  ['test.tesi@test.com', 'second.example@gmail.com', 'third@gmail.com']\n  Email sent successfully\n  Users marked as confirmed on MongoDB\n\n  ==========\n  1 confirmation emails were sent to 3 users.\n\n\nContributing\n============\n\nPackage author and current maintainer is Shay Palachy (shay.palachy@gmail.com); You are more than welcome to approach him for help. Contributions are very welcomed.\n\nInstalling for development\n--------------------------\n\nClone:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  git clone git@github.com:DataHackIL/dhutil.git\n\n\nInstall in development mode with test dependencies:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  cd dhutil\n  pip install -e \".[test]\"\n\n\nRunning the tests\n-----------------\n\nTo run the tests (none at the moment), use\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  python -m pytest --cov=dhutil\n\n\nAdding documentation\n--------------------\n\nThis project is documented using the `numpy docstring conventions`_, which were chosen as they are perhaps the most widely-spread conventions that are both supported by common tools such as Sphinx and result in human-readable docstrings (in my personal opinion, of course). When documenting code you add to this project, please follow `these conventions`_.\n\n.. _`numpy docstring conventions`: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt\n.. _`these conventions`: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt\n\n\nCredits\n=======\nCreated by Shay Palachy  (shay.palachy@gmail.com).\n\n.. |PyPI-Status| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/dhutil.svg\n  :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dhutil\n\n.. |PyPI-Versions| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/dhutil.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dhutil\n\n.. |LICENCE| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/dhutil.svg\n  :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dhutil\n",
