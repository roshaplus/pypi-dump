    "description": "This package is meant to help manage development environments using docker, while providing an interface similar to that of python's virtualenvwrapper module.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Simple cli to create, switch to and delete environments that allow you to fiddle to your heart's content without breaking anything else.\n\n* Currently this is based on a clean Ubuntu install (ubuntu:latest docker image) with basic python 2.7 configured.\n\n* Save your environment to a tarfile in case you want to take it with you anywhere.\n\n* Export the python history of anything you tried while using the python interpreter within your environment into a JupyterNotebook file that can be used with any Jupyter server (like the jupyter/notebook docker image).",
