    "description": "It's All Ghosts\n===============\n\nWhat this is\n------------\n\nIt's All Ghosts is a universal \"editor extension\" for the GhostText_ browser\nadd-on.\n\nWhile `It's All Text`_ was able to spawn almost any editor, GhostText focuses\non such editors that are able to run plugin code on their own. This leaves\nusers of most simple editors, like joe_, jupp_, nano_, gedit_ or kwrite_ behind.\n\nCompared to fully supported editors, there is a small trade-off: GhostText\ncan update the text live between the input field and the editor.  This is\nnot possible with It's All Ghosts.  Instead, It's All Ghosts simply spawns\nthe editor on connect and passes the file contents back on exit.  It does,\nhowever, update the temporary file upon a change notification from the\nbrowser and some editors track file modifications - don't use that, however,\nbecause it will almost certainly destroy your contents somewhere.\n\nBut apart from that, you can now again use your favourite editor again!\n\nHow to define your editor\n-------------------------\n\nIt's All Ghosts defaults to running nano in an xterm.\n\nYou can place your own script to execute as editor into\n``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/itsallghosts_cmd``. Example::\n\n    exec konsole --separate -e jstar $*\n\nThis example runs jstar (from the joe_ suite) in KDE's Konsole instead.\n\nHow to run\n----------\n\nJust make sure that ``itsallghosts`` is running in your desktop session.\n\nMulti-user mod\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe architecture of the GostText protocoll does not allow running on a\nmulti-user system, as it relies on port 4001 being available to exactly one\nuser.\n\nIt's All Ghosts can be run as a system service, handing off single sessions\nto the corresponding user. This is done by introspecting the HTTP connection\nand is a bit of black magic not guaranteed to work correctly.\n\nTo run the system service, simply run ``itsallghosts`` as root (this is the\nonly way of getting hold of socket owners).\n\nIn each user session then run::\n\n    itsallghosts --user\n\nDevelopment and contributing\n----------------------------\n\nIt's All Ghosts is very basic and sure can use some improvements. You can\nreport issues or contribute in the `EduGit repository` (also open to GitHub\nand other users).\n\nIt's All Ghosts is licenced under the MIT license (see the LICENSE file for\nthe text).\n\n.. _GhostText: https://github.com/GhostText/GhostText\n.. _joe: https://joe-editor.sourceforge.io/\n.. _jupp: https://www.mirbsd.org/jupp.htm\n.. _nano: https://www.nano-editor.org/\n.. _gedit: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit\n.. _kwrite: https://www.kde.org/applications/utilities/kwrite/\n.. _`It's All Text`: https://github.com/docwhat/itsalltext\n.. _`EduGit repository`: https://edugit.org/nik/itsallghosts\n",
