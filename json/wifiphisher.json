It is primarily a social engineering attack that unlike other methods it does not include any brute forcing. It is an easy way for obtaining credentials from captive portals and third party login pages (e.g. in social networks) or WPA/WPA2 pre-shared keys.\n\nWifiphisher works on Kali Linux and is licensed under the GPL license.\n\n## How it works\nAfter achieving a man-in-the-middle position using the Evil Twin attack, Wifiphisher redirects all HTTP requests to an attacker-controlled phishing page.\n\nFrom the victim's perspective, the attack makes use in three phases:\n\n1. **Victim is being deauthenticated from her access point**. Wifiphisher continuously jams all of the target access point's wifi devices within range by forging \u201cDeauthenticate\u201d or \u201cDisassociate\u201d packets to disrupt existing associations.\n2. **Victim joins a rogue access point**. Wifiphisher sniffs the area and copies the target access point's settings. It then creates a rogue wireless access point that is modeled by the target. It also sets up a NAT/DHCP server and forwards the right ports. Consequently, because of the jamming, clients will eventually start connecting to the rogue access point. After this phase, the victim is MiTMed.\n3. **Victim is being served a realistic specially-customized phishing page**. Wifiphisher employs a minimal web server that responds to HTTP & HTTPS requests. As soon as the victim requests a page from the Internet, wifiphisher will respond with a realistic fake page that asks for credentials or serves malwares. This page will be specifically crafted for the victim. For example, a router config-looking page will contain logos of the victim's vendor. The tool supports community-built templates for different phishing scenarios.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img width=\"70%\" src=\"https://wifiphisher.github.io/wifiphisher/diagram.jpg\" /><br /><i>Performing MiTM attack</i></p>\n\n## Requirements\nFollowing are the requirements for getting the most out of Wifiphisher:\n\n* Kali Linux. Although people have made Wifiphisher work on other distros, Kali Linux is the officially supported distribution, thus all new features are primarily tested on this platform.\n* One wireless network adapter that supports AP mode. Drivers should support netlink.\n* One wireless network adapter that supports Monitor mode and is capable of injection. Again, drivers should support netlink. If a second wireless network adapter is not available, you may run the tool with the --nojamming option. This will turn off the de-authentication attack though.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the latest development version type the following commands:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/wifiphisher/wifiphisher.git # Download the latest revision\ncd wifiphisher # Switch to tool's directory\nsudo python setup.py install # Install any dependencies (Currently, hostapd, dnsmasq, PyRIC, blessings)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can download the latest stable version from the <a href=\"https://github.com/wifiphisher/wifiphisher/releases\">Releases page</a>.\n\n## Usage\n\nRun the tool by typing `wifiphisher` or `python bin/wifiphisher` (from inside the tool's directory).\n\nBy running the tool without any options, it will find the right interfaces and interactively ask the user to pick the ESSID of the target network (out of a list with all the ESSIDs in the around area) as well as a phishing scenario to perform.\n\n***\n\n```shell\nwifiphisher -aI wlan0 -jI wlan4 -p firmware-upgrade\n```\n\nUse wlan0 for spawning the rogue Access Point and wlan4 for DoS attacks. Select the target network manually from the list and perform the \"Firmware Upgrade\" scenario.\n\nUseful for manually selecting the wireless adapters. The <a href=\"https://wifiphisher.org/ps/firmware-upgrade/\">\"Firmware Upgrade\"</a> scenario is an easy way for obtaining the PSK from a password-protected network.\n\n***\n\n```shell\nwifiphisher --essid CONFERENCE_WIFI -p plugin_update -pK s3cr3tp4ssw0rd\n```\n\nAutomatically pick the right interfaces. Target the Wi-Fi with ESSID \"CONFERENCE_WIFI\" and perform the \"Plugin Update\" scenario. The Evil Twin will be password-protected with PSK \"s3cr3tp4ssw0rd\".\n\nUseful against networks with disclosed PSKs (e.g. in conferences). The <a href=\"https://wifiphisher.org/ps/plugin_update/\">\"Plugin Update\"</a> scenario provides an easy way for getting the victims to download malicious executables (e.g. malwares containing a reverse shell payload).\n\n***\n\n```shell\nwifiphisher --nojamming --essid \"FREE WI-FI\" -p oauth-login\n```\n\nDo not target any network. Simply spawn an open Wi-Fi network with ESSID \"FREE WI-FI\" and perform the \"OAuth Login\" scenario.\n\nUseful against victims in public areas. The <a href=\"https://wifiphisher.org/ps/oauth-login/\">\"OAuth Login\"</a> scenario provides a simple way for capturing credentials from social networks, like Facebook.\n\n***\n\n```shell\npython bin/wifiphisher --lure10-capture --nojamming\n```\n\nProceed with only one card (--nojamming) and capture the BSSIDs that are discovered during AP selection phase.\n\n***\n\n```shell\npython bin/wifiphisher --lure10-exploit area_20170414_123200 --essid \"WiFiSense-Tagged-WLAN\"\n```\n\nMake nearby Windows devices believe that are within the area that was previously captured with `--lure-capture` by fooling the Windows Location Service. Broadcast a WLAN that is tagged as WiFi-Sense in that area. This will result in automatic association of nearby Windows devices.\n\n\nFollowing are all the options along with their descriptions (also available with `wifiphisher -h`):\n\n| Short form | Long form | Explanation |\n| :----------: | :---------: | :-----------: |\n|-h | --help| show this help message and exit |\n|-jI JAMMINGINTERFACE| --jamminginterface JAMMINGINTERFACE|\tManually choose an interface that supports monitor mode for deauthenticating the victims.

Example: --essid 'Free WiFi'|\n|-p PHISHINGSCENARIO| --phishingscenario PHISHINGSCENARIO\t|Choose the phishing scenario to run.This option will skip the scenario selection phase. Example: -p firmware_upgrade|\n|-pK PRESHAREDKEY| --presharedkey PRESHAREDKEY|\tAdd WPA/WPA2 protection on the rogue Access Point. Example: -pK s3cr3tp4ssw0rd|\n|-qS| --quitonsuccess|\tStop the script after successfully retrieving one pair of credentials.|\n|-lC| --lure10-capture| Capture the BSSIDs of the APs that are discovered during AP selection phase. This option is part of Lure10 attack.\n|-lE LURE10_EXPLOIT |--lure10-exploit LURE10_EXPLOIT| Fool the Windows Location Service of nearby Windows users to believe it is within an area that was previously captured with --lure10-capture. Part of the Lure10 attack.|\n\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://wifiphisher.github.io/wifiphisher/ss5.png\" /><br /><i>Targeting an access point</i></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://wifiphisher.github.io/wifiphisher/ss2.png\" /><br /><i>A successful attack</i></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://wifiphisher.github.io/wifiphisher/ss7.png\" /><br /><i>Fake <a href=\"https://wifiphisher.org/ps/firmware-upgrade/\">router configuration page</a></i></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://wifiphisher.github.io/wifiphisher/ss6.png\" /><br /><i>Fake <a href=\"https://wifiphisher.org/ps/oauth-login/\">OAuth Login Page</a></i></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://wifiphisher.github.io/wifiphisher/ss4.png\" /><br /><i>Fake <a href=\"https://wifiphisher.org/ps/wifi_connect/\">web-based network manager</a></i></p>\n\n## Help needed\nIf you are a Python developer or a web designer you can help us improve wifiphisher.
