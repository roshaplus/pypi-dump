But sometimes\nit makes more sense to have the messages in a queue that can absorb changes in rate and de-couple the sending service from a potentially slow or unavailable backend.\n\nwebhook2lambda2sqs generates code for an `AWS Lambda <https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/>`_ function\nto receive webhook content via `API Gateway <https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/>`_ and push it\nto an SQS queue, where it can be consumed as needed. It supports multiple endpoints via unique URL\npaths (API Gateway resources), where content sent to each endpoint is pushed to one or more SQS\nqueues.\n\nIn addition, webhook2lambda2sqs includes a wrapper around HashiCorp Terraform to automate creation\nand maintenance of all or part of the infrastructure required to operate this (the API Gateway\nand its configuration, the Lambda function, the function's IAM role, etc.). If TerraForm isn't\na viable option for you to manage infrastructure with, you can use the generated configuration\n(which maps quite closely to AWS API parameters) as a guide for manual management.\n\nThere are also helper commands to view the Lambda Function and API Gateway logs,\nsend a test message, and view the queue contents.\n\nFor full documentation, see: `http://webhook2lambda2sqs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ <http://webhook2lambda2sqs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n* An Amazon AWS account to run this all in (note - it will probably be cheap, but not free)\n* Python 2.7+ (currently tested with 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5). Note that AWS Lambda currently only supports python 2.7 as an execution environment, but you're welcome to use other versions on the machine where you run this project.\n* Python `VirtualEnv <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_ and ``pip`` (recommended installation method; your OS/distribution should have packages for these)\n* `HashiCorp Terraform <https://www.terraform.io/>`_ >= 0.6.16 to manage the AWS infrastructure, if desired. Terraform is written in Go,  and `distributed <https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html>`_ as a static binary.\n\nProgram Components\n------------------\n\n* Lambda Function code generation\n* Terraform configuration generation\n* Management of infrastructure via Terraform\n* AWS-related helpers for inspecting queues and logs, querying information, and\n  enabling metrics/logging/rate limiting on the API Gateway.\n\nFull Documentation\n------------------\n\nFor full documentation, see: `http://webhook2lambda2sqs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ <http://webhook2lambda2sqs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_\n\nBugs and Feature Requests\n-------------------------\n\nBug reports and feature requests are happily accepted via the `GitHub Issue Tracker <https://github.com/jantman/webhook2lambda2sqs/issues>`_. Pull requests are\nwelcome. Issues that don't have an accompanying pull request will be worked on\nas my time and priority allows.\n\nA Note About the License\n------------------------\n\nThis program is licensed under the `GNU Affero General Public License, version 3.0 or later <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html>`_ (\"AGPLv3\").\nThe AGPLv3 includes a clause that source code must be made available to anyone using the program over a network.\n\n\n",
