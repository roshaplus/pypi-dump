    "description": "Pants is an Apache2 licensed build tool written in Python.\n\nThe latest documentation can be found `here <http://pantsbuild.org/>`_.\n\n1.3.x Stable Releases\n=====================\n\nThis document describes releases leading up to the ``1.3.x`` ``stable`` series.\n\n1.3.0 (06/06/2017)\n------------------\n\nThe ``1.3.0`` stable release, with no addition changes since the rc4 release!\n\nA quick summary of exciting changes since the ``1.2.x`` branch:\n\n* Pants' python backend has been overhauled and modernized to support caching, and to lower the\n  latency of re-running tests after a code edit.\n* Pants now uses a `native code 'engine' <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C64MreDeVoZAl3HrqtWUVE-qnj3MyWW0NQ52xejjaWw/edit?usp=sharing>`_\n  implemented in rust, which unlocks significant performance improvements in the future.\n* A daemon that caches BUILD file parsing and file fingerprinting (and more to follow!) is now `ready\n  for alpha testing <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/b5eaf05ef533df4c5f93a3728107a27f25726941/pants.daemon.ini>`_\n  (with `two significant caveats <http://www.pantsbuild.org/invoking.html#the-pants-daemon>`_).\n* A default set of `implicit_sources <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/4300>`_ can now be\n  manually enabled to further reduce BUILD file boilerplate. This option should become the\n  default in the next stable release.\n* The Zinc incremental scala compiler is now at 1.0.0, with improved incremental behaviour.\n* Style-related tasks that used to be in the `compile` goal have moved to a new `lint` goal.\n* The `fmt` goal was added, with support for scalafmt, `gofmt`, and python `isort` to start.\n* `Support for yarnpkg <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/4255>`_ in the node contrib module.\n* Support for `relative 'jar' declarations <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/4279>`_, to\n  allow for committing jars in your repo (if that's your bag!)\n* A contrib module for `errorprone <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/4163>`_ was added.\n* Direct support for `scalatest` tests in the pants JVM test runner.\n\nSee the rest of this page for the complete list of changes.\n\n1.3.0rc4 (05/27/2017)\n---------------------\n\nThe fifth release candidate for 1.3.0, with fixes for two more user reported issues.\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n* Temporarily restore recursive behaviour for bundle filesets (#4630)\n  `PR #4630 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/4630>`_\n  `PR #4624 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/4624>`_\n  `PR #4624 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/4624>`_\n\n* Check that test case attribute exists in junit xml file before converting it (#4623)\n  `Issue #4619 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/4619>`_\n  `PR #4623 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/4623>`_\n\n\n1.3.0rc3 (05/23/2017)\n---------------------\n\nThe fourth release candidate for 1.3.0, which fixes an issue that caused spurious cache misses\ncross platform in the v2 engine.\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n* [engine] Check for duplicate deps in v2 graph construction.
