    "description": "hulk is a big dumb proxy server for testing service-heavy applications. Designed for use with requests>=2.0.0. hulk caches request data behind the scenes for later use in application testing. Note that hulk is not a mocking library, it caches actual service calls for later use. We've found that when we have dozens of large API requests to internal and external sources (in every imaginable format), we were spending too much time trying to mock out the data, and then the mocks were often incomplete and brittle, or that data applied under one context, but would need another mock for a slightly different context.\r\n\r\nInstead of writing mocks until the end of time, we wrote hulk. Hulk does the heavy lifting so you can get busy writing tests.",
