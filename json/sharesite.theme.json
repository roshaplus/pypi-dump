    "description": "***************\nsharesite.theme\n***************\n\nThis package, ``sharesite.theme``, provides the theme (or \"look-and-feel\" or\n\"skin\") for a Plone_ site that reflects the essence of the Leona M and Harry B\nHelmsley Charitable Trust's website at http://helmsleytrust.org/.  It's for\nuse with the Sinai-Helmsley Alliances for Research Excellence (SHARE).\n\n.. _Plone: http://plone.org/\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nUse zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to manage your\nproject, adding this package as an egg.
