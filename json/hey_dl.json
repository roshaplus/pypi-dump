    "description": "hey_dl\n======\nDirectory Localizer helps you localize directories.\n\n__doc__\n-------\nPeriodically, you'll want to know where a Python source file is actually\nlocated on disk.  You might want this for all sorts of reasons, and it's\nalways a bit messy when you do want to know.\n\nDirectoryLocalizer solves two problems:\n\n1. it lets you know where you are on disk, assuming you're not\n   anywhere crazy, like in a zip import, and\n2. it lets you pass that location to other code that might want\n   to know where you are.\n\nUsage is extremely simple:\n\n1. Make a DirectoryLocalizer object, dl (or whatever).\n2. Call dl.set() from the file you want to locate on disk.\n3. Any code that can access dl can now call:\n\n   * dl.dir(): for the directory of the file where dl.set()\n     was called,\n   * dl.path(fn): for the filename of a file in the directory\n     where dl.set() was called,\n   * dl.file(fn): for a file object of the file in dl.path(fn), and\n   * dl.read(fn): to get a read of the file in d.file(fn).",
