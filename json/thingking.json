The PageCacheURL class\ndefines an LRU mechanism for caching pages from a URL, with a\ndefault page size of 1 MB and an active pool of 1024 pages.  The\nHTTPArray class extends this model to numpy arrays, while httpfile\nsupplies a file-like interface.\n\nOnce the URL is mapped to an HTTPArray, an application may index the\narray as if it was present in main memory.  The interface also enables\n\"lazy loading\", using a small amount of RAM even for very large\nresources.\n\nCopyright (c) 2014, Matthew J. Turk, Samuel W. Skillman and Michael S.

Each player gets up to 8,388,608 THINGS in the version 4 game.\n    In older games, each player gets up to 262,144 things.\n\n2.  Things are kept in CRATES that hold 512 things each.  Things\n    in the same crate are called crate-mates.\n\n3.  Crates are stored either in the WORKSHOP or a WAREHOUSE.  The\n    workshop is almost always too small to hold all the crates.\n\n4.  There is only one workshop but there may be several warehouses.\n    Everybody shares them.\n\n5.  Each thing has its own THING NUMBER.\n\n6.  What you do with a thing is to ZARK IT.  Everybody takes turns\n    zarking.\n\n7.  You can only zark your things, not anybody else's.\n\n8.  Things can only be zarked when they are in the workshop.\n\n9.  Only the THING KING knows whether a thing is in the workshop or\n    in a warehouse.\n\n10. The longer a thing goes without being zarked, the GRUBBIER it is\n    said to become.\n\n11. The way you get things is to ask the thing king.  He gives out\n    things only in full crates at a time.\n\n12. The way you zark a thing is to give its thing number.  If you\n    give the number of a thing that happens to be in the workshop it\n    gets zarked right away.  If it is in a warehouse, the thing king\n    packs the crate containing your thing back into the workshop.  If\n    there is no room in the workshop, he first finds the grubbiest\n    crate in the workshop, whether it be yours or somebody else's,\n    and packs it off with all its crate-mates to a warehouse.  In its\n    place he puts the crate containing your thing.  Your thing then\n    gets zarked and you never knew that it wasn't in the workshop all\n    along.\n\n13. Each player's things have the same numbers as everybody else's.\n    The thing king always knows who owns what thing and whose turn\n    it is, so you can't ever accidentally zark somebody else's thing\n    even if it has the same thing number as one of yours.\n\n14. If the thing king must move a crate from the warehouse to the\n    workshop to let you zark it, he first sends you to sleep so you\n    don't mind the wait.\n\n        NOTES\n\n1.  Traditionally, the thing king sits at a large, segmented table\n    and is attended to by pages (the so-called \"TABLE PAGES\") whose\n    job it is to help the thing king remember where all the things\n    are, who they belong to, and how grubby they are.\n\n2.  One consequence of Rule 13 is that everybody's thing numbers will\n    be similar from game to game, regardless of the number of players.\n\n3.  The thing king has a few things of his own, some of which move\n    back and forth between workshop and warehouse just like anybody\n    else's.  Some, however, are just too heavy to move out of the\n    workshop.\n\n4.  With the given set of rules, oft-zarked things tend to get kept\n    mostly in the workshop while little-zarked things stay mostly in\n    a warehouse.  This is efficient stock control.\n\n5.  Sometimes even the warehouses get full.  The thing king then has\n    to start piling things on the dump out back.  This makes the game\n    slower because it takes a long time to get things off the dump\n    when they are needed in the workshop.  The thing king tries to\n    select the grubbiest things in the warehouse to send to the dump\n    in his spare time, but sometimes even this doesn't help, and the\n    thing king has to take more time away from players to move crates.\n    This is caused by a player trying to zark so many things at once\n    that even crates which aren't grubby at all have to be moved into\n    the warehouse.  This is called THRASHING, and at times like these\n    the game is more for a fool than the thing king.\n\n6.  From note 5, a player can figure out that if he has a lot of\n    things to zark, it is best to zark only a small number of things\n    at once, and to get a thing's zarking done with quickly.  That\n    way, the thing king doesn't have to do as much thrashing, and\n    can reward the player by putting him to sleep less often.  Players\n    who do this win the game, and help other players win too.\n\n--  several sources (last snarfed from SCORE's bboard)\nnn",
