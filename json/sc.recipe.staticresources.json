    "description": "*************************\nsc.recipe.staticresources\n*************************\n\n.. contents:: Table of Contents\n\nLife, the Universe, and Everything\n==================================\n\nThis package is used as a recipe to integrate Plone and Webpack using buildout.\n\nIn the recent years, many tools were created to manage static resource files, these tools can:\n\n* Automatically compress images.\n* Use CSS Pre-processors and Post-processors to write less and better code, taking advantage of new standards still not available to all browsers.\n* Use Javascript transpiller to write ES6 code and generate ES5 equivalent code, that work on all browsers.\n* Minify resulting code.\n* And many other options, pratically everything related to process static resources can be achived by an official or community package.\n\nThis package has the dutty to facilitates the integration of Webpack with Plone,\nwriting less lines into your buildout configuration and provide a nice template to start with.\n\nWe choose Webpack because it is proven to be the best toolchain available, and many people in the Plone Community are using it.\n\nMostly Harmless\n===============\n\n.. image:: http://img.shields.io/pypi/v/sc.recipe.staticresources.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sc.recipe.staticresources\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/travis/simplesconsultoria/sc.recipe.staticresources/master.svg\n    :target: http://travis-ci.org/simplesconsultoria/sc.recipe.staticresources\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/simplesconsultoria/sc.recipe.staticresources/master.svg\n    :target: https://coveralls.io/r/simplesconsultoria/sc.recipe.staticresources\n\nGot an idea? Found a bug? Let us know by `opening a support ticket <https://github.com/simplesconsultoria/sc.recipe.staticresources/issues>`_.\n\nDon't Panic\n===========\n\nInstallation\n\n\nTo enable this product in a buildout-based installation:\n\n#. Edit your buildout.cfg and add these lines:\n\n.. code-block:: ini\n\n    [buildout]\n    ...\n    parts +=\n        webpack\n        staticresources\n\n    [webpack]\n    recipe = gp.recipe.node\n    version = 6.6.0\n    npms = npm yarn\n    scripts = npm yarn\n\n    [staticresources]\n    recipe = sc.recipe.staticresources\n    name = my.package.name\n    short_name = mypackagename\n\nAfter updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will take care of updating your system.\n\nThe recipe is responsible to:\n\na. Create webpack folder structure, if not exists\nb. Create one script to access webpack environment to handle more complex scenarios.\nc. Create all scripts listed in webpack/package.json scripts entries.\n\nConfiguration Options\n---------------------\n\nname (required)\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nThis is the package name or the theme name used in the package.\nThis field is required.\n\nshort_name (required)\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nA short name is needed to be used as the UMD Javascript library name and the name of the script inserted into Plone.\nThis field is required.\n\ndirectory\n^^^^^^^^^\nRelative path to webpack folder, you can use this field to define more than one webpack folder for different themes.\nIf this option is not present, the default value is ``${buildout:directory}/webpack``.\n\ndestination\n^^^^^^^^^^^\nDestination path relative to webpack directory, you should add this option to point the resulting static resources folder,\nit can be the theme folder or a static resources directory.\nIf this option is not present, the default value is ``./dist`` folder.\n\nbobtemplate\n^^^^^^^^^^^\nCustom webpack bobtemplate path, if you prefer, it is possible to change the default bobtemplate to another to follow your project needs.\nIf this option is not present, the default value is the bobtemplate that exists into this package.\n\nThe default template\n--------------------\nIn the default template we selected what Webpack tools are valid to our needs, what is basically Theme and addons development.\nThis is the list of what we include:\n\nHTML Loader\n^^^^^^^^^^^\n`HTML Loader <https://github.com/webpack-contrib/html-loader>`_ is used to process the HTML file in our use case we use it when create a new theme.\n\nImage Webpack Loader\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n`Image Webpack Loader <https://github.com/tcoopman/image-webpack-loader>`_ process all images referenced to save space in the final images,\nit tile the workflow with some specialized tools for each image format.\n\nSVG URL Loader\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n`SVG URL Loader <https://github.com/bhovhannes/svg-url-loader>`_ process all SVG files and create a data-url string.\nFor example it inserts the SVG file into the final CSS file to save requests.\n\nWebpack SpriteSmith\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n`Webpack SpriteSmith <https://github.com/mixtur/webpack-spritesmith>`_ brings an easy way to create image sprites,\nyou simply add the icon images in one folder and it creates all you need to use the sprite with your choosen CSS pre-processor.\n\nBabel transpiller\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n`Babel <https://babeljs.io/>`_ makes possible to use the next generation of Javascript today.\n\nSass\n^^^^\n`Sass <http://sass-lang.com/>`_ is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.\n\nPostCSS\n^^^^^^^\n`PostCSS <https://github.com/postcss/postcss>`_ is a post-processor used to transform styles with JS plugins.\nIn our configuration we use just `CSS next <http://cssnext.io/>`_ plugin to add automatically all vendor prefixes for the last 3 versions of major browsers,\nwhat means that acordding the browsers support more features,\nyour final CSS will automatically cost less bytes.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nIn our simplest example, those scripts are created:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ bin/env-mypackagename\n\nThis command set the buildout node installation in the system PATH, this way you can use Webpack as described on Webpack docs.\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ bin/watch-mypackagename\n\nThis command makes Webpack wait for any change in any SASS, JS (ES6) files and generate the minified version of CSS and JS (ES5) UMD module for your application.\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ bin/debug-mypackagename\n\nThis does the same as watch command, but don't try to minify the final CSS and JS.  Used for debug purpose.\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ bin/build-mypackagename\n\nThis command build the CSS and JS minified, but don't wait for any change.\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ bin/test-mypackagename\n\nThis command run the JS tests using `karma <https://karma-runner.github.io>`_, `mocha <https://mochajs.org/>`_, `chai <http://chaijs.com/>`_ and `sinon <http://sinonjs.org/>`_.\n\nNote that the short_name is added in the end of the script, this way you can have multiple webpack folders in the same package (if you have multiple themes inside the same package for example).\n\nShare and Enjoy\n===============\n\nThis package would not have been possible without the contribution of the following people:\n\n- Rodrigo Ferreira de Souza\n- H\u00e9ctor Velarde\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.0a2 (2018-01-24)\n------------------\n\n- Review how HTML and CSS are processed (closes `#23 <https://github.com/simplesconsultoria/sc.recipe.staticresources/issues/23>`_).\n  [rodfersou]\n\n- Remove old scripts generated by this recipe after buildout run (closes `#21 <https://github.com/simplesconsultoria/sc.recipe.staticresources/issues/21>`_).\n  [rodfersou]\n\n- Rename script to debug instead of dev to avoid misunderstanding (closes `#22 <https://github.com/simplesconsultoria/sc.recipe.staticresources/issues/22>`_).\n  [rodfersou]\n\n- Fix webpack installation conflict (closes `#25 <https://github.com/simplesconsultoria/sc.recipe.staticresources/issues/25>`_).\n  [rodfersou]\n\n- Fix package license typo on template.\n  [hvelarde]\n\n- Run build command after update recipe (closes `#18 <https://github.com/simplesconsultoria/sc.recipe.staticresources/issues/18>`_).\n  [rodfersou]\n\n- Add an error log if directory parameter is invalid.\n  [rodfersou]\n\n\n1.0a1 (2017-11-21)\n------------------\n\n- Initial release.",
