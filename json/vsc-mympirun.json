    "description": "# Description\n\n`mympirun` is a tool to make it easier for users of HPC clusters to run MPI programs with good performance.\n\nIt wraps around the `mpiexec`/`mpirun`/... commands that are provided by the different MPI implementations (OpenMPI, Intel MPI, ...).\n\n`mympirun` will determine the `mpirun` command to use, sets up the environment, and takes into account the available resources to configure it.\n\nOriginally created by the [HPC team of Ghent University](http://ugent.be/hpc).\n\n\n# License\n\n`vsc-mympirun` is made available under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2.\n\n\n# Basic usage\n\nThe most basic form of using mympirun is `mympirun [options] your_program [program options]`. \n\nMympirun parses options until it runs into something it doesn't recognize as an option and assumes this is the executable, and everything after it are options for the program. To separate mympirun options from program options manually, use `--` in between both.\n\n\n# Setup\n\nThe `vsc-mympirun` installation provides 'fake' `mpirun` commands to try and ensure that `mympirun` is always used. These fake `mpirun` commands basically wrap around `mympirun` (which in turn wraps around the real `mpirun` command).\n\nTherefore, you should make sure that the location of the `mympirun` command and the fake `mpirun` is prepended to `$PATH`. If `mympirun` is provided via a module, you should load it *after* any other modules.\n\n\n# Detection of MPI and job scheduler\n\n`mympirun` detects which MPI implementation (OpenMPI, Intel MPI, ...) is being used, to figure out which `mpirun` command it should be using. This can be overridden using the `--setmpi` or `-M` option. An overview of known MPI implementations is available via `-m` or `--showmpi`.\n\nIn addition, the job scheduler (e.g., Torque) is also detected automatically, and can be overridden via `--schedtype` or `-S`. If no job scheduler could be detected, local execution is assumed.\n\nAn overview of known job schedulers is available via `-s` or `--showsched`.\n\n\n# Available resources\n\n`mympirun` will detect the available resources, and pass options to the `mpirun` command being used accordingly.\n\nBy default, it will use all available cores, i.e.:\n\n* all cores on the *current* system, if the `local` scheduler is used\n* all cores assigned to the current job, if the `pbs` scheduler is used\n\nThis can be changed if needed using the `--hybrid`, `--universe`, `--double` or `--multi` options, see below.\n\nPinning of MPI processes to cores is also enabled by default (can be disabled using `--disable-pinmpi`).\n\nIt will also leverage the Torque integration of the MPI library being used by default, by launching MPI processes using `pbsdsh` rather than `ssh`. (See also: [Controlling launcher](#controlling-launcher))\n\n\n# Configuring `mympirun`\n\nTo get a full overview of available `mympirun` options, run `mympirun --help`.  \n\nFor each command line option, there is a corresponding environment variable `$MYMPIRUN_*` (for example, `--basepath` corresponds to `$MPI_BASEPATH`) and configuration file entry. Command line options override environment variables, and environment variables override configuration files.\n\n# Controlling number of processes\n\n## `--hybrid` / `-h`\nThe `--hybrid` or `-h` option requires one integer. This integer specifies the number of processes started on each available physical node.\n        \n    $ echo $PBS_NUM_NODES\n    2\n\n    $ mympirun --hybrid 2 ./mpi_hello\n    Hello world from processor node2157.delcatty.os, rank 1 out of 4 processors\n    Hello world from processor node2158.delcatty.os, rank 3 out of 4 processors\n    Hello world from processor node2158.delcatty.os, rank 2 out of 4 processors\n    Hello world from processor node2157.delcatty.os, rank 0 out of 4 processors\n\n\n\n## `--universe`\nThe `--universe`option also requires one integer. This integer will be the exact number of processes started by mympirun (independent of the number of nodes).\n        \n    $ echo $PBS_NUM_NODES\n    2\n\n    $ mympirun --universe 1 ./mpi_hello\n    Hello world from processor node2157.delcatty.os, rank 0 out of 1 processors\n    \n    $ echo $PBS_NUM_NODES\n    3\n\n    $ mympirun --universe 2 ./mpi_hello\n    Hello world from processor node2157.delcatty.os, rank 1 out of 2 processors\n    Hello world from processor node2157.delcatty.os, rank 0 out of 2 processors\n    \n\n## `--double` and `--multi`\nAs the name suggests, when using the `--double` option,  mympirun will start double the amount of processes as it normally would. The `--multi` option works the same but it requires an integer, indicating the multiplier, for example, `--multi 3` will start triple the amount of processes. This means `--double` and `--multi 2` will have the exact same effect.\n\n    $ echo $PBS_NUM_NODES\n    2\n\n    $ echo $PBS_NUM_PPN\n    2\n\n    $ mympirun --double ./mpi_hello\n    Hello world from processor node2157.delcatty.os, rank 1 out of 8 processors\n    Hello world from processor node2158.delcatty.os, rank 3 out of 8 processors\n    Hello world from processor node2157.delcatty.os, rank 0 out of 8 processors\n    Hello world from processor node2158.delcatty.os, rank 2 out of 8 processors\n    \n\n\n# Controlling output\n\nUse `--output` to redirect the output of the (MPI) program being run to a file instead of stdout/stderr. \n\n    $ mympirun --output out.txt hostname\n    \n    $ cat out.txt\n    node2157.delcatty.os\n    node2157.delcatty.os\n\n\n# Passing down environment variables\n\nThe environment variables that mympirun passes down into the environment of the MPI processes include `CLASSPATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`,  `LD_PRELOAD`, `PATH`, `PYTHONPATH`, `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` and all environment variables that are prefixed with `DAPL`, `IPATH`, `KMP`, `MKL`, `O64`, `OMP`, `PSC`, `PSM`, `TMI`,  and `VSMP`. \n\nTo add other variables to this list, you can use the mympirun option  `--variablesprefix`. This option requires a comma-seperated list of strings. Mympirun will pass the exact string and every environment variable that starts with the string followed by an underscore. For example, `--variablesprefix MPI` will pass on the environment variables `$MPI`, `$MPI_FOO`, `$MPI_BAR` etc.\n\n    $ cat echo_my_env_var\n    echo ${MY_ENV_VAR:-default_value}\n\n    $ export MYENV_VAR=\"myenv_var\"\n\n    $ mympirun ./echo_my_env_var\n    default_value\n    default_value\n    \n    $ mympirun --variablesprefix MYENV ./echo_my_env_var\n    myenv_var\n    myenv_var\n\n\n# Controlling launcher\n\nIn recent Intel MPI versions (> 4.1), mpirun uses Hydra as its process manager. It is possible to change the launcher Hydra uses using the `--launcher` option. (see [Bootstrap Options](https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/589997))\n\nBy default, mympirun will use `pbsdsh` as launcher, which is provided by the Torque/PBS resource manager.\nIt enables distributing tasks under control of Torque, ensuring that the processes are properly pinned to the resources available in the job.\n\nThis is a better alternative to using `ssh` as launcher.\n\n\n# Passing options to `mpirun`\n\nTo pass options directly to the mpirun command, use `--mpirunoptions`. This option is used with a string of options, which is then appended to the mpirun command generated by mympirun.  \n\nOptions to be used with Intel MPI can be found in the [Command Reference](https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/528769) section of the Intel MPI documentation. For options with OpenMPI, check the [mpirun man page](https://www.open-mpi.org/doc/v1.8/man1/mpirun.1.php).\n\n\n\n# Hang detection\n\nIf your MPI program doesn't have any output for a long time, mympirun will assume something is wrong and will interrupt your job as a safety measure (we wouldn't want your program to \"hang\" for hours, or even days, without really doing anything).  The default time mympirun waits for output is one hour (3600 seconds).\n\nYou can change the amount of time mympirun waits for output by using the option `output-check-timeout` with a number of seconds, or you can make the warning non-fatal by using the option `--disable-output-check-fatal`. In this case a warning will be printed, but the program will not be interrupted.\n\n# Debugging\n\nTo get all debugging info from mympirun itself, use the option `--debug` or simply `-d`. This will print to stdout by default. \n\nFor debugging on MPI level, use `--debugmpi`.\n\nRedirecting the logger output of a mympirun script to a file is done with the option `--logtofile`. \n\n# Internal Workflow\n\nThe first step of mympirun is making sure that every mpirun command passes through mympirun. This is accomplished by prepending a fake mpirun path to `$PATH`, which will catch the attempt to execute mpirun and forward it to mympirun.\n\nNext, the script will import every MPI flavor implementation from `lib/vsc/mympirun/mpi`. This way it is possible to deduce the MPI flavor that is requested by observing the path of the executable that called mympirun.\n\nIt will follow the same process for determining the scheduler. Both MPI flavor and scheduler flavor can be overwritten by using the `--setmpi`/`-M` and `--schedtype`/`-S` options respectively.\n\nOnce both flavors have been set, the script will get some standard MPI configuration variables, such as usable nodes, netmask,... It will handle CPU pinning if enabled.\n\nAfter setting up, it will transform the command line arguments and other global environment variables to a dict with options that the chosen MPI flavor can understand.\n\nFinally, it passes these options to the correct mpirun executable of the selected MPI flavor.\n",
