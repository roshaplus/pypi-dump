    "description": "A full-featured editor for text files and more, Peppy provides an XEmacs-like multi-window, multi-tabbed interface using the Advanced User Interface (wx.aui) framework of wxPython.  It is built around the emacs concept of major modes -- different views are presented to the user depending on the type of data being edited.  Text files are shown using the wx.stc (Scintilla) editing component, binary files use a grid layout showing hexadecimal representation of the binary data, scientific image datasets are displayed using a raster band image displayer, and more.  Peppy is designed to be very extensible using setuptools plugins.",
