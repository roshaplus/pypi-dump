    "description": "Eyegrade\n(`<http://www.eyegrade.org/>`_)\nuses a webcam to grade multiple choice question exams.\nNeeding just a cheap low-end webcam, it aims to be a low-cost\nand portable alternative to other solutions based on scanners.\n\nThe main features of Eyegrade are:\n\n- Grading the exams: By using a webcam, the graphical user interface\n  of Eyegrade allows you to grade your exams. Eyegrade is able to\n  recognize not only the answers to the questions, but also the\n  identity of the student by using its hand-written digit recognition\n  module. The whole process is supervised by the user in order to\n  detect and fix potential detection errors.\n\n- Exporting grades: Grades can be exported in CSV format, compatible\n  with other programs such as spreadsheets.\n\n- Typesetting the exams: Although you can create your exams with other\n  tools, Eyegrade integrates an utility to creating MCQ exams. It is\n  able to create your exams in PDF format. Eyegrade can automatically\n  build several versions of the exam by shuffling questions and the\n  choices within the questions.\n\nThe user manual can be found at\n`<http://www.eyegrade.org/documentation.html>`_\n\nRequirements:\n--------------\n\nEyegrade runs on Python 2.7 only.\nIn addition, it requires `OpenCV version 2.4 <http://opencv.org/>`_\nand `PyQt4 <https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download>`_\nto work properly:\n\n- For GNU/Linux systems install those packages from your distribution.\n  For example, in Debian (Stretch and previous versions) and Ubuntu\n  (16.10 and previous versions) just install the packages\n  `python-opencv` and `python-qt4`.\n  Note that `a bug in OpenCV 3 <https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/4969>`_\n  makes Eyegrade fail with\n  that version, and some distributions ship already OpenCV 3.\n\n- For Windows platforms you can download OpenCV and PyQt4 from their\n  official websites.\n\n- For Mac OS/X I haven't tested the program.\n  I believe it should be possible to install these dependencies\n  and make Eyegrade work,\n  but I'm not sure because I don't own a Mac computer.\n  Feedback on this would be much appreciated.",
