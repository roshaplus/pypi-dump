    "description": "The ILAMB Benchmarking System\n=============================\n\nThe International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) project is a\nmodel-data intercomparison and integration project designed to improve\nthe performance of land models and, in parallel, improve the design of\nnew measurement campaigns to reduce uncertainties associated with key\nland surface processes. Building upon past model evaluation studies,\nthe goals of ILAMB are to:\n\n* develop internationally accepted benchmarks for land model\n  performance, promote the use of these benchmarks by the\n  international community for model intercomparison,\n* strengthen linkages between experimental, remote sensing, and\n  climate modeling communities in the design of new model tests and\n  new measurement programs, and\n* support the design and development of a new, open source,\n  benchmarking software system for use by the international community.\n\nIt is the last of these goals to which this repository is\nconcerned. We have developed a python-based generic benchmarking\nsystem, initially focused on assessing land model performance.\n\nILAMB 2.1 Release\n-----------------\n\nWe are pleased to announce version 2.1 of the ILAMB python package,\nwith the following new features:\n\n* Revamped treatment of relationships. Relationship plots now also\n  include a difference plot of the distributions as well as a\n  representation of the mean relationship function. We have moved the\n  relationships to their own tab in the dataset HTML pages and given\n  them their own scores. The first is based on the Hellinger distance,\n  which quantifies the difference between the model and data\n  distributions. The second is a RMSE score used to quantify the\n  similarity of the model and observation mean relationship\n  curves. This revamp also removed unneeded recomputation, speeding up\n  the entire ILAMB run by 25%.\n* Logfiles are now generated when ILAMB is run. They contain more\n  information about the python packages used, the amount of time spent\n  on each process, and more debugging information when errors are\n  encountered. Look for files with the ``.log`` suffix in the\n  ``_build`` directory after ILAMB is run.\n* We have removed ``demo/driver.py`` and added an executable version\n  ``ilamb-run``. When you install the ILAMB package, this new script\n  will be added to your ``bin`` directory. This allows you to run the\n  ILAMB package anywhere without needing to copy the driver. Thanks to\n  Mark Piper for this contribution.\n* We have added an option to the ``ilamb-run`` script which allows\n  users to shift the time representation in the model results. This is\n  helpful during model development to compare model results to the\n  ILAMB suite without needing to fully spin up the model. The option\n  syntax is ``--model_year y0 yf`` which will make the year ``y0`` in\n  the models equal to ``yf``, shifting all times by ``yf-y0`` years.\n* The ``ILAMB.Variable`` object now has support for layered data,\n  including a new member function ``integrateInDepth``.\n* Improved calendar conversion capability, enabling the use of models\n  with calendars other than ``noleap``.\n* All plots now color land areas in a light grey, and oceans with a\n  darker grey. Plots over the globe will be in the Robinson projection\n  for both globally gridded data as well as sites. Regional plots now\n  mask out areas not in the region and will be in the cylindrical\n  projection.\n* ILAMB is now listed in the `Python Package Index\n  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ and can now be installed using\n  ``pip``. The installation tutorial has been rewritten to reflect\n  this change as well as adapted based on user feedback to be more\n  helpful.\n* Numerous bugfixes, many cosmetic, but a few substantive fixes include:\n  \n  * Moved to using the ``with`` statement for handling the opening of\n    files. This ensures that files always close, even when errors are\n    thrown.\n  * Fixed a bug which caused intermittent inconsistencies when running\n    in parallel. This would cause the scores for some models/variables\n    to appear as Nans, despite the fact that the analysis was run.\n  * Fixed a bug relating to the computation of RMSE scores. Scores\n    were too low relative to ILAMB v1 because the wrong normalizer was\n    being used. Thanks to Alberto Martinez-de la Torre for this patch.\n  * Fixed code which triggers depracation warnings from numpy and\n    matplotlib.\n  \n\n  \nUseful Information\n------------------\n\n* `Documentation\n  <http://climate.ornl.gov/~ncf/ILAMB/docs/index.html>`_ of the public\n  API is included in the repository, but also hosted if you follow the\n  link.\n* `Sample output\n  <http://www.climatemodeling.org/~nate/ILAMB/index.html>`_ gives you\n  an idea of the scope and magnitude of the package capabilities.\n* You may cite the software package by using the following reference (DOI:10.18139/ILAMB.v002.00/1251621).\n\nFunding\n-------\n\nThis research was performed for the Biogeochemistry--Climate Feedbacks\nScientific Focus Area, which is sponsored by the Regional and Global\nClimate Modeling (RGCM) Program in the Climate and Environmental\nSciences Division (CESD) of the Biological and Environmental Research\n(BER) Program in the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.",
