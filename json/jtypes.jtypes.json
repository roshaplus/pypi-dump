    "description": "jtypes.jtypes\n=============\n\nPure Python Java bridge.\n\nOverview\n========\n\n  | jtypes.jtypes is a bridge between Python and Java, allowing these to intercommunicate.\n  | It is an effort to allow python programs full access to Java class libraries.\n  |\n  | jtypes.jtypes is a lightweight Python Java package, based on the ctypes FFI library.\n  | He was made under the strong influence of Steve Menard's good known JPype package\n    by reimplementing whole it's functionality in a clean Python instead of C/C++.\n\n  Find the `documentation at Read the Docs: <http://jtypes.readthedocs.org>`__.\n\n  jtypes.jtypes is an effort to allow python programs full access to Java class libraries.\n  This is achieved not through re-implementing Python, as Jython/JPython has done,\n  but rather through interfacing at the native level in both virtual machines.\n\n  Eventually, it should be possible to replace Java with python in many, though not\n  all situations. JSP, Servlets, RMI servers and IDE plugins are good candidates.\n\nKnown Bugs/Limitations\n----------------------\n\n- Java classes outside of a package (in the ``<default>``) cannot be imported.\n- Because of lack of JVM support, you cannot shutdown the JVM and then restart it.\n- | Some methods rely on the \"current\" class/caller.\n  | Since calls coming directly from python code do not have a current class,\n    these methods do not work.\n  | The User Manual lists all the known methods like that.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n- Either the Sun/Oracle JRE/JDK or OpenJDK.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n::\n\n    pip install --upgrade jtypes.jtypes\n\nTo ensure everything is running correctly you can run the tests using\n\n::\n\n    python -m jt.jtypes.tests\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n+ Python 2.7 or higher or 3.3 or higher\n\n  * http://www.python.org/\n  * Versions lower than 2.7 or lower than 3.3 WON'T WORK.\n  * 2.7 and 3.4 are primary test environments.\n\n+ pip or setuptools\n\n  * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip\n  * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n  | Copyright (c) 2014-2016 Adam Karpierz\n  |\n  | Licensed under the zlib/libpng License\n  | http://opensource.org/licenses/zlib\n  | Please refer to the LICENSE file.\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\n* Adam Karpierz <python@python.pl>\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n0.1.1 (2005-10-05)\n------------------\n- Initial version.",
