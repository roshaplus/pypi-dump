    "description": "pybktree\n========\n\npybktree is a generic, pure Python implementation of a `BK-tree`_ data\nstructure, which allows fast querying of \"close\" matches (for example, matches\nwith small hamming distance or Levenshtein distance). This module is based on\nthe algorithm by Nick Johnson in his `blog article on BK-trees`_.\n\nThe library is `on the Python Package Index (PyPI)`_ and works on both Python\n3 and Python 2.7. To install it, fire up a command prompt, activate your\nvirtual environment if you're using one, and type:\n\n::\n\n    pip install pybktree\n\nExample usage:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> tree = pybktree.BKTree(pybktree.hamming_distance, [0, 4, 5, 14])\n    >>> tree.add(15)              # add element 15\n    >>> sorted(tree)              # BKTree instances are iterable\n    [0, 4, 5, 14, 15]\n    >>> sorted(tree.find(13, 1))  # find elements at most 1 bit away from element 13\n    [(1, 5), (1, 15)]\n\nFor large trees and fairly small N when calling ``find()``, using a BKTree is\nmuch faster than doing a linear search. This is especially good when you're\nde-duping a few hundred thousand photos -- with a linear search that would\nbecome a very slow, O(N\u00b2) operation. With a BKTree, it's more like O(N log N).\n\nRead the code in `pybktree.py`_ for more details \u2013 it's pretty small!\n\nOther BK-tree modules I found on GitHub while writing this one:\n\n* `ahupp/bktree`_: this one is pretty good, but it's not on PyPI, and it's\n  recursive\n* `ryanfox/bktree`_: this one is hard to customize, ``search()`` doesn't\n  return distances, it's slower, and was buggy (though I think he fixed it\n  recently)\n\npybktree was written by `Ben Hoyt`_ for `Jetsetter`_ and is licensed with a\npermissive MIT license (see `LICENSE.txt`_).\n\n\n.. _BK-tree: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BK-tree\n.. _blog article on BK-trees: http://blog.notdot.net/2007/4/Damn-Cool-Algorithms-Part-1-BK-Trees\n.. _on the Python Package Index (PyPI): https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pybktree\n.. _pybktree.py: https://github.com/Jetsetter/pybktree/blob/master/pybktree.py\n.. _ahupp/bktree: https://github.com/ahupp/bktree\n.. _ryanfox/bktree: https://github.com/ryanfox/bktree\n.. _Ben Hoyt: http://benhoyt.com/\n.. _Jetsetter: http://www.jetsetter.com/\n.. _LICENSE.txt: https://github.com/Jetsetter/pybktree/blob/master/LICENSE.txt",
