    "description": "# HADeploy\n\nHADeploy is a tool specially designed to deploy application in BigData/NoSQL context with Hadoop cluster as first target.\n\nIn such context, deploying an application is not only matter of deploying some jar in some place. It also means creating a bunch of associated resources such as Hive table, Kafka topic, HBase table, HDFS folders and files, systems account, etc.\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou will find documentation [at this location](http://www.hadeploy.com/)\n\n## Base principles\n\n### Application manifest\n\nAn application can be fully described in one file, hosting all components and resources description.\n\n### Infrastructure independency\n\nApplication file is independent of target physical infrastructure. This target is defined in another file and HADeploy will take care of the merge on deployment\n\n### Environment independency.\n\nIn the same way, the application file is independent of the environment (DEV, INT, PPRD, PROD,..). This ensure coherency and repeatable deployments among these contexts\n\n### Declarative programming and reconciliation\n\nHADeploy is a purely descriptive tool. As such usage will consist of defining the expected state of the deployed application and let the tool perform the reconciliation between expected and actual state.\n\n### Idempotence\n\nSuch principle means HADeploy is a fully idempotent tools, as if expected state match the actual ones, the tool will not perform any further actions.\n\n### Application instance isolation.\n\nA typical deployment pattern allowed by HADeploy is to define \u2018Application Container\u2019, or \u2018Application Lane\u2019. Then several instance (or version) of an application can be installed and run in parallel.\n\n### Kerberos support\n\nHADeploy is able to deploy application on a Hadoop cluster secured by Kerberos. \n\n### Rights management\n\nHADeploy will manage all permissions associated to the deployed components and resources.\n\n### Plugins architecture\n\nHADeploy is designed with a highly modular plugins architecture, thus allowing easy third party extension.\n\n### Application Removal\n\nAs HADeploy knows about all the components of your application, it provides a REMOVAL mode, which restores the target cluster in its initial state.\n\n### Open Source\n\nHADeploy is a fully open source project, under GNU General Public License.",
