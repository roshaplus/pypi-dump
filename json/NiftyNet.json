    "description": "NiftyNet\n========\n\nNiftyNet is a `TensorFlow`_-based open-source convolutional neural networks (CNN) platform for research in medical image analysis and image-guided therapy.\nNiftyNet's modular structure is designed for sharing networks and pre-trained models.\nUsing this modular structure you can:\n\n* Get started with established pre-trained networks using built-in tools\n* Adapt existing networks to your imaging data\n* Quickly build new solutions to your own image analysis problems\n\nNiftyNet is a consortium of research groups (WEISS -- `Wellcome EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences`_, CMIC -- `Centre for Medical Image Computing`_, HIG -- High-dimensional Imaging Group), where WEISS acts as the consortium lead.\n\nFeatures\n========\n\nNiftyNet currently supports medical image segmentation and generative adversarial networks.\n**NiftyNet is not intended for clinical use**.\nOther features of NiftyNet include:\n\n* Easy-to-customise interfaces of network components\n* Sharing networks and pretrained models\n* Support for 2-D, 2.5-D, 3-D, 4-D inputs [#]_\n* Efficient discriminative training with multiple-GPU support\n* Implementation of recent networks (HighRes3DNet, 3D U-net, V-net, DeepMedic)\n* Comprehensive evaluation metrics for medical image segmentation\n\n.. [#] 2.5-D: volumetric images processed as a stack of 2D slices; 4-D: co-registered multi-modal 3D volumes\n\nGetting started and contributing\n================================\n\nPlease follow the instructions on the `NiftyNet source code repository`_.\n\nCiting NiftyNet\n===============\n\nIf you use NiftyNet, please cite the following paper:\n\n::\n\n  @InProceedings{niftynet17,\n    author = {Li, Wenqi and Wang, Guotai and Fidon, Lucas and Ourselin, Sebastien and Cardoso, M.
