    "description": "newrelic-marklogic-plugin\n=========================\n\n`NewRelic <http://www.newrelic.com>`__ plugin for monitoring\nMarkLogic.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n-  Easy to install\n-  Configurable selection of metrics to retrieve\n-  Retrieve summary metrics on local cluster, hosts, servers & forests.\n-  Retrieve detail metrics on databases, forests, hosts, groups & servers.\n-  Proxy access to NewRelic api\n-  Sample monitoring dashboards available at `NewRelic plugin central <https://newrelic.com/plugins>`__.\n\nBefore you start\n----------------\n\nRequire minimally `Python 2.7.10  <https://www.python.org/>`__ installed.\n\n`Requests python package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests>`__ v2.11 or greater.\n\nRequire minimally `MarkLogic v7.0-6 <http://developer.marklogic.com/products>`__ installed\nand running.\n\nRequire `NewRelic <http://www.newrelic.com/>`__ account.\n\nDocs\n----\n\n`newrelic-marklogic-plugin docs on github <https://github.com/marklogic/newrelic-plugin>`__\n\n`newrelic-marklogic-plugin docs on pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic-marklogic-plugin>`__\n\n\nInstall, configure & run\n------------------------\n\nInstall the plugin using any of the following methods.\n\n- install from pypi repository\n\n    ``pip install newrelic-marklogic-plugin``\n\n- install direct from github\n\n    ``pip install https://github.com/marklogic/newrelic-plugin/archive/master.zip``\n\n- download `release <https://github.com/marklogic/newrelic-plugin/releases>`__  (or clone) repository and run the following.\n\n    ``python setup.py install``\n\n\nNext step is to create and edit configuration file.\n\n1) Copy\n   `etc/newrelic\\_marklogic.conf.sample <https://github.com/marklogic/newrelic-plugin/blob/master/etc/newrelic_marklogic.conf.sample>`__\n   and to ``newrelic_marklogic.conf``\n\n2) Edit ``newrelic_marklogic.conf`` ensuring correct MarkLogic\n   connection details and NewRelic license key\n\nStart reporting metrics to NewRelic by running the following.\n\n    ``newrelic_marklogic.py -c newrelic_marklogic.conf``\n\nWhich samples metrics every period of length duration as set within configuration.\n\nIt is recommended to initiate plugin as a background task, run via a scheduler (ex. cron job) or using any other\napproach appropriate for your environment.\n\nRunning with -h flag will emit usage instructions for running plugin.\n\n    ``newrelic_marklogic.py -h``\n\n::\n\n    usage: ./newrelic_marklogic.py [-h] [-c config file] [-l log file]\n\n    -h print usage instructions  (this message)\n    -c config file               (default: newrelic_marklogic.conf)\n    -l log file                  (default: newrelic_marklogic.log)\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe configuration file drives all newrelic-marklogic-plugin features and is split into several sections.\n\nThe 'marklogic' section contains connection details to MarkLogic server and Management REST API.\n\n::\n\n    [marklogic]\n\n    # Scheme to use when accessing MarkLogic management REST API (http|https).\n    scheme = http\n\n    # Host to use when accessing MarkLogic management REST API (FQDN hostname).\n    host = localhost\n\n    # Port to use when accessing MarkLogic management REST API.\n    port = 8002\n\n    # Authentication to use when accessing MarkLogic management REST API (BASIC|DIGEST).\n    auth= DIGEST\n\n    # Username to use when accessing MarkLogic management REST API.\n    user = admin\n\n    # Password to use when accessing MarkLogic management REST API.\n    pass = admin\n\nThe 'newrelic' section specifies the NewRelic license key. Optionally you may nominate a proxy for accessing the NewRelic Plugin API.\n\n::\n\n    [newrelic]\n\n    # Your NewRelic license key.\n    key = ****************************************\n\n    # Proxy (ex. http://10.10.1.10:3128).\n    http_proxy =\n\nThe 'plugin' section defines sample period for updating NewRelic, as well as the logging level for emitting messages about plugin operation.\n\nThere are a set of configurations for defining which statuses are captured by NewRelic, summarised below.\n\n- summary_status (True|False): retrieve local cluster summary status.\n- databases (list of databases): retrieve database detailed status.\n- hosts_summary_status (True|False):  retrieve summary of all hosts status.\n- hosts (list of hosts): retrieve host detailed status.\n- forests_summary_status (True|False): retrieve summary of all forests status.\n- forests (list of forests): retrieve forest detailed status.\n- groups (list of groups): retrieve group detailed status.\n- servers_summary_status (True|False): retrieve summary of all servers status.\n- servers (list of servers): retrieve server detailed status.\n\n::\n\n    [plugin]\n\n    # NewRelic plugin display name.\n    name = marklogic\n\n    # Unique NewRelic plugin guid.\n    guid = com.marklogic\n\n    # Sample period in seconds.\n    duration = 60\n\n    # Set logging level (INFO|DEBUG|ERROR).\n    log_level = DEBUG\n\n    # Local cluster summary.\n    summary_status= False\n\n    # Database(s) detail status.\n    databases= Documents\n\n    # Hosts summary.\n    hosts_summary_status= True\n\n    # Host(s) detail status.\n    hosts= 127.0.0.1\n\n    # Forests summary.\n    forests_summary_status= True\n\n    # Forest(s) detail status.\n    forests= Documents Meters\n\n    # Group(s) detail status.\n    groups= Default\n\n    # Servers summary.\n    servers_summary_status= True\n\n    # Server(s) detail status (must supply group name ex. ServerName:GroupName).\n    servers= Manage:Default\n\nCreate pypi distribution\n---------------------------------------\n\n1) bump version number\n\n2) create test distro\n``python setup.py register -r pypitest``\n\n3) create pypi distro\n``python setup.py register -r pypi``\n\n\nIssues, feature requests & contributing\n---------------------------------------\n\nPlease file `bug reports <https://github.com/marklogic/newrelic-plugin/issues>`__, `feature\nrequests <https://github.com/marklogic/newrelic-plugin/issues>`__, and contribute with `pull\nrequests <https://github.com/marklogic/newrelic-plugin/pulls>`__ through GitHub.\n\nCopyright & License\n-------------------\n\nnewrelic-marklogic-plugin Copyright 2016 MarkLogic Corporation\n\nnewrelic-marklogic-plugin is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"),\na copy of the license is included within this package.\n\n`Apache License v2.0 <https://github.com/marklogic/newrelic-plugin/blob/master/LICENSE>`__",
