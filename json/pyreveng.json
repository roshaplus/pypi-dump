    "description": "PyReveng3 is a toolkit for reverse engineering and analysing binary\nprograms, or for that matter, binary data.\n\nThe fundamental idea is to build data structures representing the\nanalysis, available for further programatic spelunking, rather than\njust a textual representation where the structure is flattened.\n\nOf course, dumping the textual representation in the shape of a\nlisting is one of the most typical \"further programatic spelunkings\"\none can do, but it is not limited to only that.\n\nEnjoy,\n\nPoul-Henning",
