    "description": "Talos\n=====\n\nTalos is an alternative authentication, authorization and accounting\napplication. It provides a few improvements over original django.contrib.auth\nbut is not drop-in replacement though. Migrating to talos or starting a new\napplication should be considered with care.\n\nSome of improvements include:\n * Per model or per object permissions.\n ** 'select' permission is respected by django.contrib.admin\n * Arbitrary priviledges.\n * Registration by email address only. User enters email address only to start registration and continues registration after email address confirmation.\n * Various credential type support. Username+password, network address, OTP, client certificates to name a few. Various back-ends to validate these credentials. Separation into principals and credentials.\n * Evidence requirements.\n * Management commands to manipulate principals and credentials.\n * Application tokens with restricted rights.\n * Login as admin feature.\n * List and force log off active sessions.\n * Role hierarchy with permission inheritance\n\nTalos is still work-in-progress and is not recommended for production.\n\nTerminology:\n * Principal - an entity that can be authenticated. For instance human being or application.\n * Identity\n * Credential\n * Evidence\n * Permission\n * Priviledge\n * Role\n\nAuthentication scenarios considered in Talos design:\n * Human being logs in providing username and password\n ** Basic credentials are validated against internal database\n ** Basic credentials are validated against external LDAP database\n ** Basic credentials are validated against external Microsoft Active Directory database\n * Human being logs in providing username and password, but only from specific IP subnet\n ** IPv4 and IPv6 are supported\n * Human being logs in providing username and password and one-time password\n ** One-time password may be proprietary hardware token, Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator\n * Human being logs in providing username and password and one-time password, but only from specific IP subnet\n ** One-time password may be proprietary hardware token, Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator\n ** IPv4 and IPv6 are supported\n * Application logs in providing username and password\n ** Basic credentials are validated against internal database\n ** Basic credentials are validated against external LDAP database\n ** Basic credentials are validated against external Microsoft Active Directory database\n ** HTTP Authorization header is supported\n * Application logs in from specific IP subnet\n ** No other credentials provided\n ** IPv4 and IPv6 are supported\n * Application logs in providing access token\n ** HTTP Authorization header is supported\n * Application logs in providing access token, but only from specific IP subnet\n ** HTTP Authorization header is supported\n ** IPv4 and IPv6 are supported\n\nPriviledge elevation (sudo, UAC, etc. alike) scenarios considered in Talos design:\n * Human being elevates priviledges providing username and confirming password previously used for authentication\n * Human being elevates priviledges providing username and confirming password previously used for authentication, but only from specific IP subnet\n * Human being elevates priviledges providing username and one-time password\n * Human being elevates priviledges providing username, one-time password and confirming password previously used for authentication\n * Human being elevates priviledges providing username, one-time password and confirming password previously used for authentication, but only from specific IP subnet\n\nQuick start\n-----------\n\n1. Add \"talos\" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = [\n        ...\n        'talos',\n    ]\n\n2. Set user model like this::\n\n    AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'talos.Principal'\n\n3. Set AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS like this::\n\n    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (\n        'talos.compatibility.auth.AuthBackend',\n    )\n\n4. Add middleware like this::\n    MIDDLEWARE = [\n        ....\n        'talos.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',\n        ....\n    ]\n\n5. Disable 'auth' module migrations like this::\n    MIGRATION_MODULES = {\n        'auth': None\n    }",
