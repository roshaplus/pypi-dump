    "description": "### Silhouette 1.0\n\nSilhouette is a configuration schema manager for software development projects. During their development life cycle software projects maintain configuration files with a perpetually changing schema along with multiple instances of the schema for each deployment target. By placing meta information in your source control repository and using your operating system's [password manager](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring)) Silhouette offers developers:\n\n- A way to manage a true schema of target configuration files\n- Keep sensitive information out of your source control repository\n- Maintain values per configuration directive per deployment target\n- Allow inheriting values from a base configuration (typically used for constants used by the application but usually don't differ per deployment target)\n- Provide a build system to generate configuration files for each deployment target",
