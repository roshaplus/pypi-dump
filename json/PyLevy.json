    "description": "This is a package for calculation of Levy stable distributions\n(probability density function and cumulative density function) and for\nfitting these distributions to data.\n\nIt operates by interpolating values from a table, as direct computation \nof these distributions requires a lengthy numerical integration. This \ninterpolation scheme allows fast fitting of Levy stable distributions \nto data using the Maximum Likelihood technique.\n\nDoes not support alpha values less than 0.5.",
