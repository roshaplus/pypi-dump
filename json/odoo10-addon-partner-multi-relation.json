This way, you can encode your knowledge about your\npartners directly in your partner list.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nBefore being able to use relations, you'll have define some first. Do that in\nSales / Configuration / Address Book / Partner relations. Here, you need to\nname both sides of the relation: To have an assistant-relation, you would name\none side 'is assistant of' and the other side 'has assistant'. This relation\nonly makes sense between people, so you would choose 'Person' for both partner\ntypes. For the relation 'is a competitor of', both sides would be companies,\nwhile the relation 'has worked for' should have persons on the left side and\ncompanies on the right side. If you leave this field empty, the relation is\napplicable to all types of partners.\n\nIf you use categories to further specify the type of partners, you could for\nexample enforce that the 'is member of' relation can only have companies with\nlabel 'Organization' on the left side.\n\nNow open a partner and choose relations as appropriate in the 'Relations' tab.\n\nSearching partners with relations\n---------------------------------\n\nSearching for relations is integrated transparently into the partner search\nform. To find all assistants in your database, fill in 'is assistant of' and\nautocomplete will propose to search for partners having this relation. Now if\nyou want to find Anna's assistant, you fill in 'Anna' and one of the proposals\nis to search for partners having a relation with Anna. This results in Anna's\nassistant(s), as you searched for assistants before.\n\nBy default, only active, not expired relations are shown. If you need to find\npartners that had some relation at a certain date, fill in that date in the\nsearch box and one of the proposals is to search for relations valid at that\ndate.\n\nMore info\n---------\n\nFor further information, please visit:\n\n * https://www.odoo.com/forum/help-1\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n* Holger Brunn <hbrunn@therp.nl>\n* Stefan Rijnhart <stefan@therp.nl>\n* Ronald Portier <ronald@therp.nl>\n* Sandy Carter <sandy.carter@savoirfairelinux.com>\n* Bruno Joliveau <bruno.joliveau@savoirfairelinux.com>\n* Adriana Ierfino <adriana.ierfino@savoirfairelinux.com>\n\nMaintainer\n----------\n\n.. image:: http://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: http://odoo-community.org\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nTo contribute to this module, please visit http://odoo-community.org.",
