For example, the *code* property of the agreement is used in the module *account_invoice_factur-x* (from the `edi <https://github.com/OCA/edi>`_ project) in the XML tag */CrossIndustryInvoice/SupplyChainTradeTransaction/ApplicableHeaderTradeAgreement/ContractReferencedDocument/IssuerAssignedID*.\n\nThe main differences with the *Contract* object of Odoo:\n\n* a contract is an analytic account; an agreement is not related to analytic accounting.\n* on the invoice, the contract/analytic account is per-line; an agreement is attached to the invoice (not to the lines).\n* an agreement is a very simple object with just a few basic fields; a contract has a lot of properties and a lot of related features.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nGo to the menu *Accounting > Configuration > Management > Agreements* to create new agreements.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/110/10.0\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/contract/issues>`_.
