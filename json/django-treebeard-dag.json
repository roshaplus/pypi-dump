    "description": "This app implements directed acyclic graphs for Django, with an API that will be \nvery familiar to people who've used Gustavo Picon's efficient tree implementations \nin django-treebeard before.\n\nWorks for me, but has no unit tests and may not see any improvements from me anytime \nsoon. Just putting it out there in case it might be a useful starting point for \nsomebody else.\n\ndjango-treebeard-dag comes with a simplified BSD license, a very liberal license. \nSee the included LICENSE file for details.",
