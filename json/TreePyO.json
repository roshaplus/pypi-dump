    "description": "TreePyO enables visual navigation of full object hierarcy within a Python runtime. It is ideal for grasping internals of an object_group/application. Objects, members, classes, functions, modules, lists, dicts, etc; namely, any object hierarcy can be navigated as they are alive.
