    "description": "This Package contains a tool for extracting structured data from HTML and JSON\npages.\nIt reads the page into a Node based tree, from which you, on the bases of a json\ndata-file, can extract your data into a list of items. It can first extract a\nlist of keyNodes and extract for each of them the same data-list. During the\nextraction several data manipulation functions are available.\n\nMain advantages\n - It gives you a highly dependable dataset from a potentially changable source.\n - You can easily update on changes in the source without touching your code.\n - You can make the data_def available on a central location while distributing\n   the aplication and so giving your users easy access to (automated) updates.",
