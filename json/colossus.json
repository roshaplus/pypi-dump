    "description": "python-colossus\n===============\n\nPython tools for manipulating extremely large images\n\nThis tool suite can be used as a python library or as standalone commands. Future \ndirections may include a Gimp plugin.\n\nIt was originally built in order to make it easier to manually manipulate extremely \nlarge images. The first use case was 10k-by-10x pixels (100 megapixels), but there's \nno obvious reason why it wouldn't scale up a few orders of magnitude. Users of the \ntools check in and check out portions of an image, and at any given time are working \nwith a rectangular subset of the full image. When checked in, the image data is \nstored in a prescribed directory hierarchy. The tools also provide a mechanism for \nthe creation of multiple discrete zoom levels of the original image, which can be \nstored alongside each other and edited independently. The varying zoom levels and \ntiles are stored in a manner that allows them to all be easily viewed using Google \nmaps, thus providing a quick mechanism of panning and zooming through scales of many \norders of magnitude.\n\nInstallation:\n------------\n\nAssuming you have a python installation and can use pip for package management:\n  pip install colossus\n\nOther installation mechanisms may be added later.\n\n\nGetting started:\n---------------\n\nGather small images that constitute tiles of the image at highest resolution.\nHelpers: Google maps tile downloader at specified resolution\nor\nStart with single large image, and check it in to generate data for a given zoom level.\n\n\nCheck-in/check-out:\n------------------\n\nChecking out a particular pixel range of the image means that you are creating one new \nimage file (your checked out copy) that is composed of the data from some portion of a \nsubset of tiles, cropped and joined as necessary to accommodate your requested pixel range.\n\nChecking in a particular range means that, for a given zoom level, you clobber the data \nfor some subset of tiles in the hierarchy with the data from the image that you are \nchecking in. In the future, we may add some versioning capabilities for the affected tiles \nrather than just clobbering them.\n\nViewing:\n-------\n\nUse the google maps javascript code to view the image, or try out the layers thing. If \ndesired, check out the full image at a given zoom level to stitch the entire thing together.",
