When asked from an inventory adjustment, which have\ndiscrepancies over the threshold for the location, a Slot Verification\nRequest will be created for each line that exceed the maximum discrepancy\nallowed.\n\nA SVR must be created when warehouse operation (e.g. an inventory adjustment,\na cycle count...) uncovers a count discrepancy within a slot (a small stock\nlocation), and the discrepancy is greater than the pre-defined acceptable\nvariance threshold. It is a stock manager's task to confirm the SVR and\nassign it to someone to perform it.\n\nThe aim of SVR is to find and fix errors before they are transferred to\nanother location, so they will not be found again in similar stock operations.\nIn other words, a SVR helps to correct an already existing error in our stock\nrecords the earliest possible. Many times, a SVR will likely lead to manual\nactions (before being marked as solved) in order to fix the problems uncovered.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nIn order to use this module act as follow:\n\n* From a Inventory Adjustment in state 'Pending to Approve' click in the\n  button 'Request Verification'. This will create all the Slot Verification\n  Request needed.\n* Go to 'Inventory / Inventory Control / Slot Verification Request'\n* Go to a Slot Verification Request 'Waiting Actions' and confirm it.\n* You can now check the involved lines and moves to help you.\n* Once you have found the problem and you have fixed it 'Mark as Solved' the\n  Verification.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/153/10.0\n\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/issues>`_.
