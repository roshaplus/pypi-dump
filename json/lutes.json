    "description": "Lutes\n=====\n\nPronounced as the ancient French city \"Lut\u00e8ce\", Lutes is a micro component\nentity system engine.\n\nComponent Entity System\n-----------------------\n\nComponent entity system architecture  is often used in game development.\n\nIt allows great flexibility by using composition over inheritence. It is based on three core elements:\n\nEntity\n    An entity is a mere ID that represent an object in our world\nComponent\n    A component is a structure holding the object data for an aspect of the world.\n    Several components can be associated to an entity.\nSystem\n    A system contain the logic for an aspect of the world\n\nLutes adds a fourth element: the manager. The manager is the glue that ties components, entities and systems together.\n\nYou can learn more on component entity system architecture on `this wiki <http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/>`_.\n\nWhat lutes gives you\n--------------------\n\nIn its current state, lutes gives you a simplistic structure with basic elements you can inherit from.\n\nLutes is an experiment but should be functionnal: please see how green are the badges below.\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/greizgh/lutes.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/greizgh/lutes\n\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/greizgh/lutes/badge.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://coveralls.io/r/greizgh/lutes?branch=master\n\n.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/lutes/badge/?version=latest\n    :target: https://readthedocs.org/projects/lutes/?badge=latest\n",
