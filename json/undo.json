    "description": "This is an undo/redo framework based on a functional approach which uses a undoable stack to track actions. Actions are the result of a function call and know how to undo and redo themselves, assuming that any objects they act on will always be in the same state before and after the action occurs respectively. The Stack tracks all actions which can be done or undone.",
