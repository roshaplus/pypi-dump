    "description": "PSLS: the PLATO Solar-like Light-curve Simulator\n\nSimulate solar-like oscillators representative for PLATO observations.\nThe simulator includes stochastically-excited oscillations, granulation and activity background components, as well as instrumental sources of noise representative for PLATO. The program also manages the existence of a time shift between groups of telescope.\nPlanetary transits are included following Mandel & Agol (2002) equations (see http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...580L.171M) and using the Python implementation by Ian Crossfield (http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~ianc/) at UCLA.\n\nTwo different types of oscillation spectrum can be simulated depending of the type of star:\n* Redgiant stars: oscillation spectra based on the Universal Pattern (gen_up) together with the mixed modes patterns derived from the asymptotic theory ;\n* Main-sequence and subgiant stars: oscillation spectra based on a set of eigenfrequencies computed with ADIPLS pulsation code.\n\nRotationnal mode splitings are implemented in a simplified manner.\n\nCurrent limitations: the parameters of the activity and the instrumental systematics components still need to be specified by the user.\n\nPSLS requires the following python packages: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and yaml\nTo install the program in your home directory for you own use, type:\n   python setup.py install --home=${HOME}\n\nEdit the configuration file, an example is given in psls.yaml\n\nFinally, execute PSLS:\n\t psls.py -P -V psls.yaml\n\nTo make the code working with ADIPLS, you will also need to have a grid of stellar models. We provide two grids (credit: Takafumi Sonoi):\n*  m+0y27h: stellar models with masses ranging between 0.75 and 1.15 with an initial Helium abundance Y_0=0.27 ; microscopic diffusion (no radiative accelerations) was included using the simplified equations from Michaud & Proffitt (1993). Overshoot is not included and the mixing-length parameter is fixed to 1.9\n*  m+0y24h: stellar models with masses ranging between 1.20 and 2.00 with an Helium abundance Y=0.24 ; diffusion was not included as this depletes heavy elements from the upper layers of the star, due to the neglect of radiative accelerations. An overshoot of 0.2 is assumed and the mixing-length parameter is fixed to 1.6.\n\nNote that, for RGB and clump stars, the program relies on the Universal Pattern, accordingly  stellar models are  not required for those stars.  \n\nTo install the grids proceed as follows:\n \tcd models\n \ttar zxf m+0y24h.tar.gz\n \ttar zxf m+0y27l.tar.gz\n \tcd ..\n \t\n \t\nCopyright (c) October 2017, Reza Samadi, LESIA - Observatoire de Paris\n\nThis is a free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n \nThis software is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
