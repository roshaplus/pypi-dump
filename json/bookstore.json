Bookstore also handles IPython notebook's\nautosave/checkpoint feature and as of the latest release supports multiple checkpoints:\n\n.. image:: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BVD3olXCMAA2rzb.png\n   :alt: Multiple checkpoints\n\nOnce installed and configured (added to an ipython profile), just launch\nIPython notebook like normal:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ ipython notebook\n    2013-08-01 13:44:19.199 [NotebookApp] Using existing profile dir: u'/Users/rgbkrk/.ipython/profile_default'\n    2013-08-01 13:44:25.384 [NotebookApp] Using MathJax from CDN: http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js\n    2013-08-01 13:44:25.400 [NotebookApp] Serving rgbkrk's notebooks on Rackspace CloudFiles from container: notebooks\n    2013-08-01 13:44:25.400 [NotebookApp] The IPython Notebook is running at: http://127.0.0.1:9999/\n    2013-08-01 13:44:25.400 [NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nSimply:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install bookstore\n\nAlternatively, you can always pull from the master branch if you're the adventurous type:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install git+https://github.com/rgbkrk/bookstore.git\n\nInstallation isn't the end though. You need to configure your account details\nas well as where you'll be storing the notebooks.\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nBookstore has to be added to an IPython profile and configured to work with\nyour OpenStack provider.\n\nIf you want to keep it simple, just add your configuration to the default configuration located at:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    ~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_notebook_config.py\n\nAlternatively, you can create a brand new notebook profile for bookstore:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ ipython profile create swiftstore\n    [ProfileCreate] Generating default config file: u'/Users/theuser/.ipython/profile_swiftstore/ipython_config.py'\n    [ProfileCreate] Generating default config file: u'/Users/theuser/.ipython/profile_swiftstore/ipython_notebook_config.py'\n\nWhen launching, just set the custom profile you want to use\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ ipython notebook --profile=swiftstore\n\nEach provider has their own setup for authentication.\n\nOn OpenStack Swift using Keystone Authentication\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOpenStack (generic, non provider specific) has quite a few details you'll need\nto configure, namely account name, account key, auth endpoint, and region.\nYou'll possibly need a tenant id and a tenant name.\n\nAdd this to your ipython notebook profile *ipython_notebook_config.py*, making\nsure it comes after the config declaration ``c = get_config()``.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # Setup IPython Notebook to write notebooks to a Swift Cluster\n    # that uses Keystone for authentication\n    c.NotebookApp.notebook_manager_class = 'bookstore.swift.KeystoneNotebookManager'\n\n    # Account details for OpenStack\n    c.KeystoneNotebookManager.account_name = USER_NAME\n    c.KeystoneNotebookManager.account_key = API_KEY\n    c.KeystoneNotebookManager.auth_endpoint = u'127.0.0.1:8021'\n    c.KeystoneNotebookManager.tenant_id = TENANT_ID\n    c.KeystoneNotebookManager.tenant_name = TENANT_NAME\n    c.KeystoneNotebookManager.region = 'RegionOne'\n\n    # Container on OpenStack Swift\n    c.KeystoneNotebookManager.container_name = u'notebooks'\n\nOn Rackspace's CloudFiles\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Rackspace CloudFileNotebookManager simply needs your ``USER_NAME`` and ``API_KEY``. You can also configure the region to store your notebooks (e.g. ``'SYD'``, ``'ORD'``, ``'DFW'``, ``'LON'``). Note: If you're using Rackspace UK, set your region to ``'LON'``.\n\nAdd this to your ipython notebook profile *ipython_notebook_config.py*, making\nsure it comes after the config declaration ``c = get_config()``.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # Setup IPython Notebook to write notebooks to CloudFiles\n    c.NotebookApp.notebook_manager_class = 'bookstore.cloudfiles.CloudFilesNotebookManager'\n\n    # Set your user name and API Key\n    c.CloudFilesNotebookManager.account_name = USER_NAME\n    c.CloudFilesNotebookManager.account_key = API_KEY\n\n    # Container on CloudFiles\n    c.CloudFilesNotebookManager.container_name = u'notebooks'\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nSend a pull request on `GitHub <http://www.github.com/rgbkrk/bookstore>`_. It's\nthat simple. More than happy to respond to issues on GitHub as well.",
