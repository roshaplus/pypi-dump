Since SENAITE.CORE provides the\ncore functionalities and entities used by `SENAITE.LIMS <https://github.com/senaite/senaite.lims>`_,\nthe installation of the latter is strongly recommended for an optimal user\nexperience.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nSENAITE.CORE is built on top of `Plone CMS <https://plone.org>`_, so it must be\ninstalled first.\nPlease, follow the `installation instructions for Plone 4.x <https://docs.plone.org/4/en/manage/installing/installation.html>`_\nfirst.\n\nOnce Plone 4.x is installed successfully, you can choose any of the two options\nbelow:\n\nReady-to-go installation\n------------------------\nWith this installation modality, the sources from ``senaite.core`` will be\ndownloaded automatically from `Python Package Index (Pypi) <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/senaite.core>`_.\nIf you want the latest code from the `source code repository <https://github.com/senaite/senaite.core>`_,\nfollow the `installation instructions for development <https://github.com/senaite/senaite.core/blob/master/README.rst#installation-for-development>`_.\n\nCreate a new buildout file ``senaite.cfg`` which extends your existing\n``buildout.cfg`` \u2013 this way you can easily keep development stuff separate from\nyour main buildout.cfg which you can also use on the production server::\n\n  [buildout]\n  index = https://pypi.python.org/simple\n  extends = buildout.cfg\n\n  [instance]\n  eggs +=\n      senaite.core\n\nNote that with this approach you do not need to modify the existing buildout.cfg\nfile.\n\nThen build it out with this special config file::\n\n  bin/buildout -c senaite.cfg\n\nand buildout will automatically download and install all required dependencies.\n\nFor further details about Buildout and how to install add-ons for Plone, please check\n`Installing add-on packages using Buildout from Plone documentation <https://docs.plone.org/4/en/manage/installing/installing_addons.html>`_.\n\n\nInstallation for development\n----------------------------\n\nThis is the recommended approach how to enable ``senaite.core`` for your\ndevelopment environment. With this approach, you'll be able to download the\nlatest source code from `senaite.core's repository <https://github.com/senaite/senaite.core>`_\nand contribute as well.\n\nUse git to fetch ``senaite.core`` source code to your buildout environment::\n\n  cd src\n  git clone git://github.com/senaite/senaite.core.git senaite.core\n\nCreate a new buildout file ``senaite.cfg`` which extends your existing\n``buildout.cfg`` \u2013 this way you can easily keep development stuff separate\nfrom your main buildout.cfg which you can also use on the production server.\n\n``senaite.cfg``::\n\n  [buildout]\n  index = https://pypi.python.org/simple\n  extends = buildout.cfg\n  develop +=\n      src/senaite.core\n\n  [instance]\n  eggs +=\n      senaite.core\n\nNote that with this approach you do not need to modify the existing buildout.cfg\nfile.\n\nThen build it out with this special config file::\n\n  bin/buildout -c senaite.cfg\n\nand buildout will automatically download and install all required dependencies.\n\n\nContribute\n==========\n\nWe want contributing to SENAITE.CORE to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for\nanyone, and everyone. This project adheres to the `Contributor Covenant <https://github.com/senaite/senaite.core/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_.\nBy participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report\nunacceptable behavior.\n\nContributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving\nyou the opportunity to put your stamp on SENAITE.CORE, we also are thrilled to\nreceive a variety of other contributions.
