    "description": "This is a python port of zxcvbn, which is a JavaScript password strength\ngenerator. zxcvbn attempts to give sound password advice through pattern\nmatching and conservative entropy calculations. It finds 10k common passwords,\ncommon American names and surnames, common English words, and common patterns\nlike dates, repeats (aaa), sequences (abcd), and QWERTY patterns.\n\nPlease refer to http://tech.dropbox.com/?p=165 for the full details and\nmotivation behind zxcbvn. The source code for the original JavaScript (well,\nactually CoffeeScript) implementation can be found at:\n\nhttps://github.com/lowe/zxcvbn\n\n\nFor full motivation, see:\n\nhttp://tech.dropbox.com/?p=165\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUse\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe zxcvbn module exports the password_strength() function. Import zxcvbn, and\ncall password_strength(password, user_inputs=[]).  The function will return a\nresult dictionary with the following keys:\n\nentropy            # bits\n\ncrack_time         # estimation of actual crack time, in seconds.\n\ncrack_time_display # same crack time, as a friendlier string:\n                   # \"instant\", \"6 minutes\", \"centuries\", etc.\n\nscore              # [0,1,2,3,4] if crack time is less than\n                   # [10**2, 10**4, 10**6, 10**8, Infinity].\n                   # (useful for implementing a strength bar.)\n\nmatch_sequence     # the list of patterns that zxcvbn based the\n                   # entropy calculation on.\n\ncalculation_time   # how long it took to calculate an answer,\n                   # in milliseconds. usually only a few ms.\n\nThe optional user_inputs argument is an array of strings that zxcvbn\nwill add to its internal dictionary. This can be whatever list of\nstrings you like, but is meant for user inputs from other fields of the\nform, like name and email. That way a password that includes the user's\npersonal info can be heavily penalized. This list is also good for\nsite-specific vocabulary.\n\nBug reports and pull requests welcome!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAcknowledgments\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDropbox, thank you again for supporting independent projects both inside and\noutside of hackweek.\n\nThanks to Dan Wheeler (https://github.com/lowe) for the CoffeeScript implementation\n(see above.) To repeat his outside acknowledgements (which remain useful, as always):\n\nMany thanks to Mark Burnett for releasing his 10k top passwords list:\nhttp://xato.net/passwords/more-top-worst-passwords\nand for his 2006 book,\n\"Perfect Passwords: Selection, Protection, Authentication\"\n\nHuge thanks to Wiktionary contributors for building a frequency list\nof English as used in television and movies:\nhttp://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists\n\nLast but not least, big thanks to xkcd :)\nhttps://xkcd.com/936/\n",
