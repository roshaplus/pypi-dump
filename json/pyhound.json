    "description": "**pyhound** is a command-line client for the `Hound`_ source code search\nengine. It connects to a Hound server.\n\n.. _Hound: https://github.com/etsy/Hound\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n**pyhound** requires Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3 or 3.4.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n**pyhound** needs a Hound server. See Hound documentation for further\ndetails. The steps below assume that you have a Hound server listening\n(for example on ``http://localhost:6080``).\n\nTo install **pyhound**, use ``pip``:\n\n    pip install pyhound\n\n\nFeatures\n========\n\n**pyhound** aims to output search results in the manner of ``grep``\nand hence implement some (but definitely not all) of its options.\n\nThe main feature of **pyhound** is its ``--help`` argument::\n\n    usage: pyhound [-h] [--version] [--endpoint URL] [--repos REPOSITORY_LIST]\n                   [--exclude-repos REPOSITORY_LIST] [--path FILE_PATH_PATTERN]\n                   [-A NUM] [-B NUM] [-C NUM] [--color [WHEN]] [-i] [-n]\n                   PATTERN\n    \n    A command-line client for Hound.\n    \n    positional arguments:\n      PATTERN               The regular expression to search.\n    \n    optional arguments:\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n      --version             show program's version number and exit\n      --endpoint URL        Host and port of the Hound server. You may also set a\n                            HOUND_ENDPOINT environment variable. Default:\n                            http://localhost:6080/\n      --repos REPOSITORY_LIST\n                            A comma-separated list of repositories to search in.\n                            Default: all.\n      --exclude-repos REPOSITORY_LIST\n                            A comma-separated list of repositories to exclude.\n      --path FILE_PATH_PATTERN\n                            A pattern to match against the path of candidate\n                            files.\n      -A NUM, --after-context NUM\n                            Print NUM lines of trailing context after matching\n                            lines. Cannot be used with -C.\n      -B NUM, --before-context NUM\n                            Print NUM lines of leading context before matching\n                            lines. Cannot be used with -C.\n      -C NUM, --context NUM\n                            Print NUM lines of output context. Cannot be used with\n                            -A or -B.\n      --color [WHEN], --colour [WHEN]\n                            Surround the matched (non-empty) strings, file names,\n                            line numbers and separators (for fields and groups of\n                            context lines) with escape sequences to display them\n                            in color on the terminal. WHEN may be \"never\",\n                            \"always\" or \"auto\".\n      -i, --ignore-case     Ignore case distinctions in both the PATTERN and the\n                            input files.\n      -n, --line-number     Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line\n                            number within its input file.\n\n\nStatus\n======\n\n**pyhound** is considered beta. It's only a few lines long and seems\nto work. However, it's still very new and has not seen much diverse\nusage yet.\n\nOne of the current limitations is that **pyhound** currently tries to\nretrieve all search results in a single request to the Hound server.\nThe server may return an error if there are too many results\n(currently: more than 5000) and **pyhound** will kindly display it. A\nfuture version of **pyhound** should handle this case and make\nmultiple requests to the Hound server. Note that Hound web user\ninterface has the same limitation and fails in a similar way (although\nit at least shows the first 20 results).\n\n\nAlternatives\n============\n\nApart from the web user interface, Hound comes with a command-line\nclient. However it currently (Feb. 2015) has several limitations:\n\n- it does not provide a ``grep``-like output (although a TODO comment\n  in the source suggests that it may appear someday);\n- if there are more results that the Hound server can return in a\n  single query, the command-line client displays nothing (as if there\n  was no match at all).\n\n\nThe name\n========\n\nI must apologize. It's the first time I write a Python package that\nstarts with \"py\". I thought I could resist a few years more. How naive\nof me...\n\n\nCredits, contributions and license\n==================================\n\nWell, first things first: thanks to the developers of Hound. :)\n\n**pyhound** is maintained by developpers at `Polyconseil`_. It is\nhosted on GitHub at https://github.com/polyconseil/pyhound/.\nSuggestions and patches are welcome.\n\n**pyhound** is licensed under the 3-clause BSD license, a copy of\nwhich is included in the source.\n\n.. _Polyconseil: http://www.polyconseil.fr",
