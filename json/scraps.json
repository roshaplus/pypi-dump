    "description": "scraps stands for: SuperConducting Resonator Analysis and Plotting Software\n=============\n\n.. |DOI| image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/23506/faustin315/scraps.svg\n  :target: https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/23506/faustin315/scraps\n\nScraps is a package designed to help you analyze lots of data from superconducting\nresonators. The basic idea is that you hook up your VNA (or mixer) and measure S21\nat several different temperatures and driving powers. Maybe you have a PID and some\ndecent automation software that take several hundred traces, and now you don't know\nwhat to do with all that data. Enter scraps. Scraps will organize it all and run\nfits on it, and make pretty pictures you can show your advisor or funding committee\nor spouse (when asked what you do all day upon returning home) or even put into a\njournal article.\n\nCurrently scraps is designed to handle resonator S21 data at varying temperatures\nand input powers. There are plans to extend scraps to handle varying magnetic field\nalso, as well as noise in addition to S21. If you would like to be a part of that,\nget involved by posting a message here.\n\nLicense\n-----\nScraps is licensed under the MIT license, so feel free to copy it, play with it,\nmodify it, etc. under those terms (which are pretty loose!).\n\nDocumentation\n--------\nInstallation is as simple as::\n\n  pip install scraps\n\nFor complete API documentation, more in depth installation instructions and some\nexample tutorials, see the official documentation at: http://scraps.readthedocs.io\n\nCitation\n------\nIf you use scraps in a publication, please cite the Zenodo DOI:  |DOI|\n\nShort description of files that aren't code:\n------------------\n\n- Example1: a JuPyter notebook that will help you get started with the basics.\n  Focus is on a single S21 sweep.\n\n- Example2: a slightly more advanced tutorial that focuses on lots of sweeps at\n  several temperatures and powers.\n\n- ExampleData.zip: A ton of actual superconducting resonator data from a Nb\n  microstrip resonator made at ANL.\n\nSupport\n------\nPlease post any bugs or feature requests here on GitHub. Bugs will be squashed ASAP.\nFeature requests will be seriously considered!",
