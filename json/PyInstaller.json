The user can run the packaged app without installing a Python\ninterpreter or any modules.\n\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/travis/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/3.2.1.svg?label=Linux\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/\n   :alt: Travis CI test status (Linux)\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/travis/pyinstaller/pyinstaller-osx-tests/master.svg?label=OS%20X\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/pyinstaller/pyinstaller-osx-tests\n   :alt: Travis CI test status (OS X)\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/matysek/pyinstaller/3.2.1.svg?label=Windows\n   :target: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/matysek/pyinstaller/branch/3.2.1\n   :alt: AppVeyor CI test status (Windows)\n\n.. image:: https://landscape.io/github/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/master/landscape.svg?\n   :target: https://landscape.io/github/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/master\n   :alt: Code health\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/PyInstaller.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyInstaller\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/PyInstaller.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyInstaller\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-v3.2.1-blue.svg\n   :target: https://pyinstaller.rtfd.io/en/v3.2.1/\n   :alt: Manual\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/changes-v3.2.1-blue.svg\n   :target: https://pyinstaller.rtfd.io/en/v3.2.1/CHANGES.html\n   :alt: Changelog\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/IRC-pyinstalller-blue.svg\n   :target: http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23pyinstaller&uio=d4\n   :alt: IRC\n\n\n:Documentation: http://pyinstaller.rtfd.io/\n:Website:       http://www.pyinstaller.org/\n:Code:          https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller\n\n\nPyInstaller reads a Python script written by you. It analyzes your code\nto discover every other module and library your script needs in order to\nexecute. Then it collects copies of all those files -- including the active\nPython interpreter! -- and puts them with your script in a single folder, or\noptionally in a single executable file.\n\n\nPyInstaller is tested against Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. However, it is not\na cross-compiler: to make a Windows app you run PyInstaller in Windows; to make\na Linux app you run it in Linux, etc. PyInstaller has been used successfully\nwith AIX, Solaris, and FreeBSD, but is not tested against them.\n\n\nMain Advantages\n---------------\n\n- Works out-of-the-box with any Python version 2.7 / 3.3-3.5.\n- Fully multi-platform, and uses the OS support to load the dynamic libraries,\n  thus ensuring full compatibility.\n- Correctly bundles the major Python packages such as numpy, PyQt4, PyQt5,\n  PySide, Django, wxPython, matplotlib and others out-of-the-box.\n- Compatible with many 3rd-party packages out-of-the-box. (All the required\n  tricks to make external packages work are already integrated.)\n- Libraries like PyQt5, PyQt4, PySide, wxPython, matplotlib or Django are fully\n  supported, without having to handle plugins or external data files manually.\n- Working code signing on OS X.\n- Bundles MS Visual C++ DLLs on Windows.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nPyInstaller is available on PyPI. You can install it through `pip`::\n\n      pip install pyinstaller\n\n\nRequirements and Tested Platforms\n------------------------------------\n\n- Python: \n\n - 2.7 or 3.3+\n - PyCrypto_ 2.4+ (only if using bytecode encryption)\n\n- Windows (32bit/64bit):\n\n - Windows XP or newer.\n    \n- Linux (32bit/64bit)\n\n - ldd: Console application to print the shared libraries required\n   by each program or shared library. This typically can be found in\n   the distribution-package `glibc` or `libc-bin`.\n - objdump: Console application to display information from \n   object files. This typically can be found in the\n   distribution-package `binutils`.\n - objcopy: Console application to copy and translate object files.\n   This typically can be found in the distribution-package `binutils`,\n   too.\n\n- Mac OS X (64bit):\n\n - Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) or newer.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nBasic usage is very simple, just run it against your main script::\n\n      pyinstaller /path/to/yourscript.py\n\nFor more details, see the `manual`_.\n\n\nUntested Platforms\n---------------------\n\nThe following platforms have been contributed and any feedback or\nenhancements on these are welcome.\n\n- FreeBSD\n\n - ldd\n\n- Solaris\n\n - ldd\n - objdump\n\n- AIX\n\n - AIX 6.1 or newer. PyInstaller will not work with statically\n   linked Python libraries.\n - ldd\n\n- PowerPC Linux (Debian)\n\n\nBefore using any contributed platform, you need to build the PyInstaller\nbootloader, as we do not ship binary packages. Download PyInstaller\nsource, and build the bootloader::\n     \n        cd bootloader\n        python ./waf distclean all\n\nThen install PyInstaller::\n\n        python setup.py install\n        \nor simply use it directly from the source (pyinstaller.py).\n\n\n\n.. _PyCrypto: https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/\n.. _`manual`: https://pyinstaller.rtfd.io/en/v3.2.1/\n\n\n\nChangelog for PyInstaller\n=========================\n\n3.2.1 (2017-01-15)\n------------------\n\n- New, updated and fixed hooks: botocore (#2094), gi (#2347), jira (#2222),\n  PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets (#2269), skimage (#2195, 2225), sphinx (#2323,)\n  xsge_gui (#2251).\n\nFixed the following issues:\n\n- Don't fail if working directory already exists (#1994)\n- Avoid encoding errors in main script (#1976)\n- Fix hasher digest bytes not str (#2229, #2230)\n\n- (Windows) Fix additional dependency on the msvcrt10.dll (#1974)\n- (Windows) Correctly decode a bytes object produced by pefile (#1981)\n- (Windows) Package ``pefile`` with pyinstaller.

Thanks\n  to many people that worked on this across several months (Daniele\n  Zannotti, Matteo Bertini, Lorenzo Mancini).\n- Improved Linux support: generated executables are fatter but now\n  should now run on many different Linux distributions (thanks to David\n  Mugnai).\n- Add support for specifying data files in import hooks. PyInstaller\n  can now automatically bundle all data files or plugins required\n  for a certain 3rd-party package.\n- Add intelligent support for ctypes: PyInstaller is now able to\n  track all places in the source code where ctypes is used and\n  automatically bundle dynamic libraries accessed through ctypes.\n  (Thanks to Lorenzo Mancini for submitting this). This is very\n  useful when using ctypes with custom-made dynamic libraries.\n- Executables built with PyInstaller under Windows can now be digitally\n  signed.\n- Add support for absolute imports in Python 2.5+ (thanks to Arve\n  Knudsen).\n- Add support for relative imports in Python 2.5+.\n- Add support for cross-compilation: PyInstaller is now able to\n  build Windows executables when running under Linux. See documentation\n  for more details.\n- Add support for .egg files: PyInstaller is now able to look for\n  dependencies within .egg files, bundle them and make them available\n  at runtime with all the standard features (entry-points, etc.).\n- Add partial support for .egg directories: PyInstaller will treat them\n  as normal packages and thus it will not bundle metadata.\n- Under Linux/Mac, it is now possible to build an executable even when\n  a system packages does not have .pyc or .pyo files available and the\n  system-directory can be written only by root. PyInstaller will in\n  fact generate the required .pyc/.pyo files on-the-fly within a\n  build-temporary directory.\n- Add automatic import hooks for many third-party packages, including:\n\n  - PyQt4 (thanks to Pascal Veret), with complete plugin support.\n  - pyodbc (thanks to Don Dwiggins)\n  - cElementTree (both native version and Python 2.5 version)\n  - lxml\n  - SQLAlchemy (thanks to Greg Copeland)\n  - email in Python 2.5 (though it does not support the old-style\n    Python 2.4 syntax with Python 2.5)\n  - gadfly\n  - PyQWt5\n  - mako\n  - Improved PyGTK (thanks to Marco Bonifazi and foxx).\n  - paste (thanks to Jamie Kirkpatrick)\n  - matplotlib\n\n- Add fix for the very annoying \"MSVCRT71 could not be extracted\" bug,\n  which was caused by the DLL being packaged twice (thanks to Idris\n  Aykun).\n- Removed C++-style comments from the bootloader for compatibility\n  with the AIX compiler.\n- Fix support for .py files with DOS line endings under Linux (fixes\n  PyOpenGL).\n- Fix support for PIL when imported without top-level package (\"import\n  Image\").\n- Fix PyXML import hook under NT (thanks to Lorenzo Mancini)\n- Fixed problem with PyInstaller picking up the wrong copy of optparse.\n- Improve correctness of the binary cache of UPX'd/strip'd files. This\n  fixes problems when switching between multiple versions of the\n  same third-party library (like e.g. wxPython allows to do).\n- Fix a stupid bug with modules importing optparse (under Linux) (thanks\n  to Louai Al-Khanji).\n- Under Python 2.4+, if an exception is raised while importing a module\n  inside a package, the module is now removed from the parent's\n  namespace (to match the behaviour of Python itself).\n- Fix random race-condition at startup of one-file packages, that was\n  causing this exception to be generated: \"PYZ entry 'encodings' (0j)\n  is not a valid code object\".\n- Fix problem when having unicode strings among path elements.\n- Fix random exception (\"bad file descriptor\") with \"prints\" in non-console\n  mode (actually a pythonw \"bug\" that's fixed in Python 3.0).\n- Sometimes the temporary directory did not get removed upon program\n  exit, when running on Linux.\n- Fixed random segfaults at startup on 64-bit platforms (like x86-64).\n\n\n1.3 (2006-12-20)\n----------------\n\n- Fix bug with user-provided icons disappearing from built executables\n  when these were compressed with UPX.\n- Fix problems with packaging of applications using PIL (that was broken\n  because of a bug in Python's import machinery, in recent Python\n  versions). Also add a workaround including Tcl/Tk with PIL unless\n  ImageTk is imported.\n- (Windows) When used under Windows XP, packaged programs now have\n  the correct look & feel and follow user's themes (thanks to the manifest\n  file being linked within the generated executable). This is especially\n  useful for applications using wxPython.\n- Fix a buffer overrun in the bootloader (which could lead to a crash)\n  when the built executable is run from within a deep directory (more than\n  70-80 characters in the pathname).\n- Bootstrap modules are now compressed in the executable (so that they\n  are not visible in plaintext by just looking at it with a hex editor).\n- Fixed a regression introduced in 1.1: under Linux, the bootloader does\n  not depend on libpythonX.X.so anymore.\n\n\n1.2 (2006-06-29)\n----------------\n\n- Fix a crash when invoking UPX with certain kinds of builds.\n- Fix icon support by re-adding a resource section in the bootloader\n  executable.\n\n\n1.1 (2006-02-13)\n----------------\n\n- (Windows) Make single-file packages not depend on MSVCRT71.DLL anymore,\n  even under Python 2.4. You can eventually ship your programs really as\n  single-file executables, even when using the newest Python version!\n- Fix problem with incorrect python path detection. Now using helpers from\n  distutils.\n- Fix problem with rare encodings introduced in newer Python versions: now all\n  the encodings are automatically found and included, so this problem should\n  be gone forever.\n- Fix building of COM servers (was broken in 1.0 because of the new build\n  system).\n- Mimic Python 2.4 behaviour with broken imports: sys.modules is cleaned up\n  afterwise. This allows to package SQLObject applications under Windows\n  with Python 2.4 and above.\n- Add import hook for the following packages:\n\n  - GTK\n  - PyOpenGL (tested 2.0.1.09)\n  - dsnpython (tested 1.3.4)\n  - KInterasDB (courtesy of Eugene Prigorodov)\n\n- Fix packaging of code using \"time.strptime\" under Python 2.3+.\n- (Linux) Ignore linux-gate.so while calculating dependencies (fix provided\n  by Vikram Aggarwal).\n- (Windows) With Python 2.4, setup UPX properly so to be able to compress\n  binaries generated with Visual Studio .NET 2003 (such as most of the\n  extensions). UPX 1.92+ is needed for this.\n\n\n1.0 (2005-09-19) with respect to McMillan's Python Installer 5b5\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Add support for Python 2.3 (fix packaging of codecs).\n- Add support for Python 2.4 (under Windows, needed to recompiled the\n  bootloader with a different compiler version).\n- Fix support for Python 1.5.2, should be fully functional now (required\n  to rewrite some parts of the string module for the bootloader).\n- Fix a rare bug in extracting the dependencies of a DLL (bug in PE header\n  parser).\n- Fix packaging of PyQt programs (needed an import hook for a hidden import).\n- Fix imports calculation for modules using the \"from __init__ import\" syntax.\n- Fix a packaging bug when a module was being import both through binary\n  dependency and direct import.\n\n\n- Restyle documentation (now using docutils and reStructuredText).\n- New Windows build system for automatic compilations of bootloader in all\n  the required flavours (using Scons)\n\n..
