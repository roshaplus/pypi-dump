    "description": "Provides a generalized information processing system that:\r\n - adheres as closely as possible to the insights and design principles that have been learned in CS (e.g., function-based, object-oriented, etc.)\r\n - expresses (the smallest number of) \"commitments\" that reflect fundamental principles how the brain/mind is organized/functions, without committing to any particular model or theory\r\n - expresses these commitments in a form that is powerful, easy to use, and familiar to behavioral scientists\r\n - allows models of this to be implemented in as flexible a way as possible, in terms of architecture and functional forms, but also in the mix of commitments made in different parts of the system to:\r\n     \u2022 time-scale of function\r\n     \u2022 granularity of representation/function\r\n\r\nThe goal is to encourage users to \"think\" about processing in a \"mind/brain-like\" way, and yet impose no constraints on what they implement or ask their model to do.",
