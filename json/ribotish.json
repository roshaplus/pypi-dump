    "description": "README for Ribo-TISH (0.1.7)\n==================================\n<2017-4-20 Peng Zhang>\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nTranslation is a critical step in gene regulation that synthesizes proteins from a given RNA template. The development of the ribosome profiling (riboseq) technique has enabled the measurement of translation at a genome-wide level. The basic idea of ribosome profiling is to perform deep-sequencing of the ribosome-protected mRNA fragment (~30 nts), termed ribosome footprints, to determine the occupancy of translating ribosomes on a given mRNA. There are several variants of the ribosome profiling technique that are based on the use of different translation inhibitors. The regular ribo-seq utilizes Cycloheximide (CHX), a translation elongation inhibitor to freeze all translating ribosomes. In contrast to CHX, the translation inhibitor lactimidomycin (LTM) and harringtonine (Harr) have a much stronger effect on initiating ribosomes. The use of these two inhibitors allows for the global mapping of translating initiating sites (TISs) when they are coupled with with ribosome profiling (TI-Seq). In addition, when LTM is used sequentially with puromycin (PMY), the TISs can be mapped quantitatively and can be compared between different conditions.\nwe present a novel algorithm, named Ribo TIS Hunter (Ribo-TISH), for identifying translation activities using ribosome profiling data. Ribo-TISH uses statistical tests to assess the significance of translation activities. It captures significant TISs using negative binomial test, and frame biased open reading frames (ORFs) using rank sum test. Ribo-TISH can also perform differential analysis between two TI-Seq data.\n\nInstall\n=======\n\nPlease check the file 'INSTALL.rst' in the distribution.\n\nUsage of Ribo-TISH\n========================\n\n::\n\n  ribotish [-h] [--version] {quality,predict,tisdiff}\n\n:Example for quality control: ``ribotish quality -b ltm.bam -g gene.gtf -t -o ltm_qual.txt``\n\n:Example for prediction: ``ribotish predict -t ltm.bam -b chx.bam -g gene.gtf -f genome.fa -o pred.txt``\n\n:Example for differential TIS: ``ribotish tisdiff -1 pred1.txt -2 pred2.txt -a qti1.bam -b qti2.bam -g gene.gtf -o diff.txt --plotout diff.pdf``\n\nThere are 3 functions available as sub-commands.\n\n:quality:\tQuality control for riboseq bam data.\n:predict:\tMain function to predict ORF/TIS.\n:tisdiff:\tCall diffential TIS between two TIS data\n\nThe main input data should be in bam file format. Reads should be trimmed and aligned to genome. Intron splicing is supported. Some attributes are needed such as NM, NH and MD. For STAR, ```--outSAMattributes All``` should be set. bam file should be sorted and indexed by samtools_.\n\n.. _samtools: https://github.com/samtools/samtools\n\n\nquality\n~~~~~~~\n\nQuality control of riboseq bam data. This function checks reads distribution around annotated protein coding regions on user provided transcripts, show frame bias and estimate P-site offset for different group of reads. Reads are grouped by read length as well as 5' end match or mismatch. 5' end mismatch ('m0') reads often have different distribution from matched reads. To turn off 5' end mismatch grouping, use ```--nom0```. \n\nThere are 3 output files: a txt file recording all distribution data, a pdf figure file and a python file for P-site offset parameters. \n\nQuick examples:\n\nFor regular riboseq\n::\n\n  ribotish quality -b chx.bam -g gene.gtf\n\nFor TI-Seq data\n::\n\n  ribotish quality -b ltm.bam -g gene.gtf -t\n\nOptions\n--------------\n\n-b RIBOBAMPATH\n``````````````\n\nRiboseq bam data file. Reads should be trimmed and aligned to genome.\n\n-g GENEPATH\n```````````\n\nGene annotation file. Acceptable formats include gtf, gff, bed and genepred with gene names. Input file format can be auto detected or specified by ```--geneformat``` option\n\n\n-o OUTPUT\n`````````\n\nOutput all distribution data. Default: bampath[:-4]+'_qual.txt'. Quality and offset estimation is based on this distribution. User can save this file for further quick estimation trying different thresholds by ```-i``` option.\n\n-t/--tis\n````````\n\nThis data is TIS enriched, for LTM and Harr. Quality will pay more attention to TIS sites.\n\n-i INPUT\n````````\n\nInput previous output file, do not read gene file and bam file again.\n\n--geneformat GENEFORMAT\n```````````````````````\n\nGene annotation file format (gtf, bed, gpd, gff, default: auto)\n\n-f FIGPDFPATH\n`````````````\n\nOutput pdf figure file. Default: bampath[:-4]+'_qual.pdf'\n\n-r PARAPATH\n```````````\n\nOutput offset parameter file. Default: bampath+'.para.py'. This file saves P-site offsets for different reads lengths in python code dict format, and can be used in further analysis.\n\n-l LENS\n```````\n\nRange of tag length Default: 25,35. The last number (35) is not included, i.e. the longest length considered is 34.\n\n-d DIS\n``````\n\nPosition range near start codon or stop codon Default: -40,20\n\n--bins BINS\n```````````\n\nBins for cds profile Default: 20\n\n--nom0\n```````````\n\nDo not consider reads with mismatch at position 0 (5' end mismatch) as a new group.\n\n--th TH\n```````\n\nThreshold for quality. Default: 0.5. Group that frame bias ratio < TH will be considered as low quality and this group of reads will not be used in further analysis. The offset for low quality groups will not be set in parameter file.\n\n-p NUMPROC\n``````````\n\nNumber of processes. Default: 1\n\n-v/--verbose\n`````````````\n\nIncrease output verbosity.\n\n\nOutput files\n------------\n\nOUTPUT\n```````\n\nOUTPUT is a txt file recording all distribution data in python format for each group of reads. These distributions are shown in pdf figure file. Quality and offset estimation is based on this distribution. User can save this file for further quick estimation trying different thresholds by ```-i``` option.\n\nPdf figure\n``````````\n\nPdf figure file is plot of all the distributions and illustration of quality and P-site offset. The left part is for 5' end matched reads and the right part is for 5' end mismatch reads if ```--nom0``` is not set. \n\nUpper panel: the length distribution of RPFs uniquely mapped to annotated protein-coding regions.\n\nLower panel: different quality metrics for RPFs uniquely mapped to annotated protein-coding regions.\nEach row shows the RPFs with different lengths.\n\n - Column 1: distribution of RPF 5\u2019 end in 3 frames in all annotated codons. The percentage of the reads from the dominant reading frame is shown. \n - Column 2: the distribution of RPF 5\u2019end count near annotated TIS. The estimate of the P site offset and TIS accuracy are also shown. The RPFs of a specific length that do not pass threshold are considered as low quality and removed.              \n - Column 3: the distribution of RPF 5\u2019end count near annotated stop codon. \n - Column 4: The RPF profile throughout the protein-coding regions in 3 frames. TIS enrich score (TIS count / CDS average) is also shown for TIS data.\n\n\n\nOffset parameter file\n`````````````````````\n\nThis file saves P-site offsets for different reads lengths in python code dict format, and can be used in further analysis. The default offset file name is bampath+'.para.py' accompanied with the input bam file, and this default file name will be auto-recognized in further analysis. The offset parameter file is easy to interpret and can be edited by user if auto estimated offsets are not satisfying. If the bam file is in a different directory and user do not want to create a parameter file in that directory, we recommend creating a link for the bam file in current working directory, e.g. ```ln -s original/dir/ribo.bam```\n\nRibo-TISH does not guarantee that it can always find best P-site offset values. Users should check the quality figures and edit the parameter file if necessary. \n\npredict\n~~~~~~~\n\nThis is the main function of Ribo-TISH. This function predicts ORF/TIS with riboseq bam files. This function uses negative binomial model to fit TI-Seq background and test significance of TIS sites. For regular riboseq data, rank sum test between in frame reads and out frame reads inside the ORF is tested.\n\nQuick examples:\n\nCombine TI-Seq and regular riboseq data\n::\n\n  ribotish predict -t ltm.bam -b chx.bam -g gene.gtf -f genome.fa -o pred.txt\n\nFor TI-Seq data only\n::\n\n  ribotish predict -t ltm.bam -g gene.gtf -f genome.fa -o pred.txt\n\nUser provided candidates with two regular riboseq data\n::\n\n  ribotish predict -b chx1.bam,chx2.bam -g gene.gtf -f genome.fa -i cand.txt -o pred.txt\n\nOptions\n--------------\n\n-t TISBAMPATHS\n``````````````\n\nInput TI-seq bam data files, comma seperated.\n\n-b RIBOBAMPATHS\n```````````````\n\nRegular riboseq bam data files, comma seperated. \n\nAt least one bam file should be provided by either ```-t``` or ```-b```.\n\n-g GENEPATH\n```````````\n\nGene annotation file for ORF prediction. Acceptable formats include gtf, gff, bed and genepred with gene names. Input file format can be auto detected or specified by ```--geneformat``` option. \nIf user need to predict on only non-coding genes and use a different gene annotation file for known ORF annotation and background estimation, use ```-a``` option to provide another gene annotation for known ORF annotation. \nIf user provided candidates ```-i``` option is set, the transcript annotation for the candidates should be found in gene annotation file.\n\n-f GENOMEFAPATH\n```````````````\n\nGenome fasta file. The fasta file should has a .fai index file accompanied with genome fasta file (indexed) or indexable (fasta sequences have fixed length in each line). This program will index the genome file before prediction if .fai index file can not be found.\n\n-o OUTPUT\n`````````\n\nOutput all possible ORF results that fit the thresholds. \n\n\n-i INPUT\n````````\n\nOnly test input candidate ORFs, format: \n\n=======  =====  =====\ntransID  start  stop \n=======  =====  =====\n\nStart, stop position is 0 based, half open. Stop - start should be multiples of 3. Transcript should be found in gene annotation file.\n\n--geneformat GENEFORMAT\n```````````````````````\n\nGene annotation file format (gtf, bed, gpd, gff, default: auto)\n\n--tispara TISPARA\n`````````````````\n\nInput P-site offset parameter files for ```-t``` bam files. The default parameter files are bampath+'.para.py' for each bam file, which is generated in ```ribotish quality``` function. To use this option, each bam file should be provided with a file, and file names are separated with comma. If no parameter file is found, default offset 12 will apply for all reads in the bam data.\n\n--ribopara RIBOPARA\n```````````````````\n\nInput P-site offset parameter files for ```-b``` bam files. Same as ```--tispara``` option.\n\n--nparts NPARTS\n```````````````\n\nGroup transcript according to TIS reads density quantile. Default: 10.\n\nTIS background estimation uses ORF in-frame read counts to estimate negative binomial parameters. Since different transcripts have different expression levels, the background is different for highly expressed and lowly expressed transcripts. Ribo-TISH groups expressed transcripts into N parts based on TIS reads density of the transcript. Each transcript group have same total number of TIS reads.\n\n-e ESTPATH\n``````````\n\nOutput TIS background estimation result. If only one bam file is provided by ```-t``` option, the default file name is tisbampath+'.bgest.txt'. If multiple TIS data provided, the default file name is tisBackground.txt\nThe result file contains negative binomial parameters, group levels and thresholds for each group.\n\n-s INESTPATH\n````````````\n\nInput background estimation result file instead of instant estimation. By default, if only one bam file is provided by ```-t``` option, the program will first look for file name tisbampath+'.bgest.txt'. If this file exists, background parameters in this file will be used. Otherwise, TIS background estimation will run and generate a result file according to ```-e``` option.\n\n\n-a AGENEPATH\n````````````\n\nAnother gene annotation file for ORF annotation instead of ```-g``` gene file\n\n--alt\n`````\n\nUse alternative start codons. If set, all codons with 1 base different from ATG will be considered as start codon in ORF finding. Affect both TIS background estimation and prediction. Do not affect ```-i``` mode prediction. To customize alt start codons, use ```--altcodons```.\n\n\n--altcodons ALTCODONS\n`````````````````````\n\nUse provided alternative start codons, comma seperated, e.g. ```--altcodons CTG,GTG,ACG```. Turn on ```--alt``` option. Do not need to provide 'ATG'. Do not support 'N' bases.\n\n--tis2ribo\n``````````\n\nAdd TIS bam counts to regular riboseq counts. Use TIS data also for ORF frame test. This option will be turned on automatically if ```-b``` is not provided.\n\n--harr\n``````\n\nThe data is treated with harringtonine (instead of LTM). For Harr data, the reads at TIS sites are not as focus as LTM reads. Reads in flanking region (default 15 codons) of TIS will not be used for TIS background estimation. To customize flanking size, use ```--harrwidth```.\n\n\n--harrwidth HARRWIDTH\n`````````````````````\n\nFlanking region for harr data, in codons. Default: 15. Turn on ```--harr``` option.\n\n--enrichtest\n````````````\n\nUse enrich test instead of frame test. Enrich test is rank sum test between in-frame reads inside ORF and same frame reads outside ORF.\n\n--nocompatible\n``````````````\n\nDo not require reads compatible with transcript splice junctions. \n\n--minaalen MINAALEN\n```````````````````\n\nMinimum amino acid length of candidate ORF, Default: 6.\n\n--genefilter GENEFILTER\n```````````````````````\n\nOnly process given genes.

Save time for re-running.\n\nIncrease output verbosity.\n\n--seq\n`````\n\nReport ORF sequences.\n\n--aaseq\n````````\n\nReport amino acid sequences.\n\nOutput files\n------------\n\nOUTPUT\n```````\nThe output is a txt file all possible ORF results that fit the thresholds. Some of the columns are:\n\n:GenomePos:\tGenome position and strand of TIS site, 0 based, half open\n:Start:\t\tTIS of the ORF on transcript\n:stop:\t\t3' end of stop codon on transcript\n:TisType:\tRelative position of this TIS to annotated ORF of the transcript.

This function uses two different TIS test results generated by ```ribotish predict``` using different QTI-Seq data. First a normalization factor is estimated by Trimmed Mean of M values (TMM) method on common significant TIS counts in the two results. Then binomial test p-value and fold change are calculated.\n\nQuick examples:\n\n::\n\n  ribotish tisdiff -1 pred1.txt -2 pred2.txt -a qti1.bam -b qti2.bam -g gene.gtf -o diff.txt --plotout diff.pdf\n\nOptions\n--------------\n\n-1 TIS1PATH, -2 TIS2PATH\n````````````````````````\n\nPredict result of group 1 & 2 TIS data\n\n-a TIS1BAMPATHS, -b TIS1BAMPATHS\n````````````````````````````````\n\nGroup 1 & 2 TIS riboseq bam files, comma seperated\n\n-g GENEPATH\n```````````\n\nGene annotation file.
