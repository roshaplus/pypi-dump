    "description": "fasttran is a simple tool using Translation Memory (TM) databases\r\nto automate human text translations.  Unlike common Computer Aided\r\nTranslation (CAT) tools (OmegaT, for instance) fasttran has no\r\nknobs to turn in the process of the translation.  Text segmentation,\r\nTM operations et al. are all hidden under the cover; you just run\r\nthe translator, get back a half-translated document, and continue the\r\nwork with common text processor interface.\r\n\r\nfasttran was designed to suit freelance translators who find evolved\r\ninterface of existing CAT tools too complicated to learn and\r\noperate.",
