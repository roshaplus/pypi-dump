    "description": "OpenSesame\n==========\nOpenSesame is an open source password management tool designed to be secure and\neasy to use. The fewer key strokes the better. OpenSesame uses GNOME-keyring to\nstore and retrieve generated passwords. Passwords are generated using APG \n(Automated Password Generator) so that the passwords are easy to remember. To\nretrieve a password you only need to remember the name the password was stored\nas. For example, run OpenSesame and enter 'twitter' to place your twitter pass-\nword into the cntl-v paste buffer.\n\nDependencies\n============\npython2.7 xdotool python-keybinder python-cairo apg python-wnck",
