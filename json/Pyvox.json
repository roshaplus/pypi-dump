    "description": "Pyvox is a Python extension module for processing volume images, particularly\r\nmedical images; it also includes some examples and simple applications.\r\n\r\nFeatures added in release 0.72 include: The interface for constructing\r\nconvolution kernels has been completely redesigned and now supports the dynamic\r\nmodification of kernels.  Internal types now have min and max attributes which\r\ncontain the minimum and maximum possible finite positive values representable in\r\nthat type.",
