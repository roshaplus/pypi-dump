    "description": "IndexedCatalog is an extension to the Zope Object Database (ZODB) that makes object retrieval easier and faster. This is accomplished by indexing all fields by type and by a query language. It supports foreign and local subobjects and date queries. IndexedCatalog does not require any additional extensions apart from the ZODB, and it is made for applications that use StandaloneZODB and not Zope.",
