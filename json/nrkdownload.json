    "description": "nrkdownload\n===========\n\n.. figure:: https://img.shields.io/badge/python-2.7%2C%203.3%2C%203.4%2C%203.5%2C%203.6-brightgreen.svg\n   :alt: Supported Python versions\n\n   Supports python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6\n\nThis is yet another commandline tool to download programs and series\nfrom NRK (Norwegian public broadcaster). It is inspired by the already\nexisting tools that you can find on GitHub. The reason I decided to make\nyet another tool, was that I found the source code of some of the other\ntools to be difficult to read and understand, and thus difficult to\ncontribute to.\n\nThe tool is written in Python, and is compatible with Python 2.7 and\n3.x. It has been tested under both Linux, MacOS and Windows.\n\nWhat does this tool add?\n------------------------\n\nWhen you download a program with this tool, it doesn't just download\nthat file. If the program is part of a series, directories for that\nseries and season is created. And the file is automatically named\naccording to its episode and season number. Subtitles and additional\nimages are also automatically downloaded. The subtitles are\nautomatically embedded in the .m4v-file, so you could decide to delete\nthe .srt-file. (I have found that in some tools (like VLC), the support\nfor included subtitles is not perfect. That's why the separate .srt-file\nis also there.)\n\nThe idea behind this is that the downloaded programs should integrate\nseamlessly into you favorite media server, e.g.\n`Plex <http://www.plex.tv>`__. If you for example download all the\nepisodes of the very popular series SKAM, you would get a\ndirectory-structure like this:\n\n::\n\n    SKAM\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 poster.jpg\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Season 01\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 SKAM - S01E01 - 1of11.jpg\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 SKAM - S01E01 - 1of11.m4v\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 SKAM - S01E01 - 1of11.no.srt\n    \u22ee\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Season 02\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 SKAM - S02E01 - 1of12.jpg\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 SKAM - S02E01 - 1of12.m4v\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 SKAM - S02E01 - 1of12.no.srt\n    \u22ee\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Season 03\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 SKAM - S03E01 - 1of10.jpg\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 SKAM - S03E01 - 1of10.m4v\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 SKAM - S03E01 - 1of10.no.srt\n        \u22ee\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 SKAM - S03E10 - 10of10.jpg\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 SKAM - S03E10 - 10of10.m4v\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 SKAM - S03E10 - 10of10.no.srt\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThere are two ways do download things: 1. You can interactively search\nfor content. You have to specify whether you are searching for a\nparticular program, or if you are searching for a series. You will go\nthrough a selection process in order to identify what is to be\ndownloaded. 1. You can specify an URL that identifies the content that\nyou want to dowload. The URL is typically copied from\nhttps://tv.nrk.no/. In this case, the download starts with no questions\nasked.\n\n::\n\n    $ nrkdownload -h\n    usage: nrkdownload [-h] [--version] [-d DIRECTORY]\n                       (-p PROGRAM | -s SERIES | -u URL)\n\n    Download series or programs from NRK, complete with images and subtitles.\n\n    optional arguments:\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n      --version             show program's version number and exit\n      -d DIRECTORY          The directory where the downloaded files will be\n                            placed\n      -p PROGRAM, --program PROGRAM\n                            Search for a program that matches the string PROGRAM.\n                            Interactive download.\n      -s SERIES, --series SERIES\n                            Search for a series that matches the string SERIES.\n                            Interactive download\n      -u URL, --url URL     Download whatever is specified by URLs, no questions\n                            asked. URLs can be copied from https://tv.nrk.no/\n\n    The files are by default downloaded to ~/Downloads/nrkdownload. This can be\n    changed by using the option -d as described above, or you can define the\n    environment variable NRKDOWNLOAD_DIR\n\nSearching for a series\n----------------------\n\nLet's say you are interested in downloading all the available episodes\nabout the rescue boat \"Elias\". You would then use the flag ``-s`` to\nspecify that you are searching for a series with the name Elias. If\nthere is more than one matching series, you will be asked to specify\nwhich one of them you want. You respond to this by typing an integer and\npressing Enter. If there is only one matching series, it skips directly\nto the next step:\n\nThen, all of the registered episodes will be listed (due to\ncopyright-issues, some of them might not be available for download). You\nthen will be asked to specify what episodes you want to download. You\nrespond to this by typing an integer or a range. The range can be\nspecified in different ways: - ``5-10`` or ``5:10``, means all episodes\nfrom 5 to 10, including both 5 and 10. - ``-10`` or ``:10``, means all\nepisodes from the start (0) to 10, including both 0 and 10. - ``10-`` or\n``10:``, means all episodes from 10 to the last, including both 10 and\nthe last. - ``-`` or ``:``, means all available episodes.\n\nSo the above would typically look like this in your terminal:\n\n::\n\n    $ nrkdownload -s elias\n\n    Matching series:\n     0: Elias p\u00e5 eventyr : 1 Sesong(er)\n     1: Elias : 2 Sesong(er)\n\n    Enter a number in the range 0-1. (q to quit): 1\n\n    Matching programs\n     0: Elias (Sesong 1): Elias\u00a0- 1:26 - S01E01\n     1: Elias (Sesong 1): Elias\u00a0- 2:26 - S01E02\n    \u22ee\n    50: Elias (Sesong 2): Elias\u00a0- 25:26 - S02E25\n    51: Elias (Sesong 2): Elias\u00a0- 26:26 - S02E26\n\n    Enter a number or interval (e.g. 8 or 5-10). (q to quit): -10\n    Getting program details for your selection of 11 programs...\n    Ready to download 11 programs, with total duration 2:01:02\n    Downloading:  35%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588                 | 2.52K/7.26K [01:25<02:22, 33.1s/s]\n\nThe progress bar shows the number of seconds of video to be downloaded,\nin this case 2:01:02 = 2\\*3600 + 62 = 7262 seconds. The next two times\nare the estimated remaining and total download time. The last number\nshows how many seconds of video are downloaded per second. So in this\nsnapshot, the video was downloaded at 33x the playback speed.\n\nIf you have already downloaded some of the episodes, those will be\nautomatically skipped (not overwritten).\n\nSearching for a program\n-----------------------\n\nIf you were interested in programs where the name \"Elias\" was mentioned\n(as opposed to the series \"Elias\", as described above), you would\nspecify that by using the flag ``-p``. The results from the search will\nbe programs, so all you have to do is to specify the program(s) you want\nby using the range syntax described above.\n\nNote that if your search string consists of more than one word, you must\nsurround it with single or double quotes.\n\nIn your terminal, that would look like this:\n\n::\n\n    $ nrkdownload -p \"redningssk\u00f8yta elias\"\n\n    Matching programs\n     0: Gratulerer med dagen! (2011): Gratulerer med dagen! 17.05.2011\u00a0- 17.05.2011 - S34E01\n     1: Dagsrevyen (Januar 2013): Dagsrevyen 10.01.2013\u00a0- 10.01.2013 - S36E10\n    \u22ee\n     6: Supernytt (2015): Supernytt 06.05.2015\u00a0- 06.05.2015 - S06E80\n     7: Barne-tv - hele sendinger (2017): Barne-tv\u00a0- 12.01.2017 - S02E12\n\n    Enter a number or interval (e.g. 8 or 5-10). (q to quit): \n\nDownload target specified by URL\n--------------------------------\n\nIf you know exactly what you want to download, there is no need to go\nthrough the interactive search described above. Instead, you can just\nspecify the download target directly with an URL. You will typically\nfind these URLs by browsing https://tv.nrk.no. Examples of such URLs\ncould be: \\* https://tv.nrk.no/serie/skam: This will download ALL the\nepisodes of ALL the seasons of this series. \\*\nhttps://tv.nrk.no/serie/skam/MYNT15000117/sesong-4/episode-1 (or just\nhttps://tv.nrk.no/serie/skam/MYNT15000117): This will dowload the\nspecified episode of that series. \\*\nhttps://tv.nrk.no/program/KMTE50001515/svartedauden (or just\nhttps://tv.nrk.no/program/KMTE50001515): This will download the\nspecified program.\n\nThe download is not interactive when you specify an URL, which means you\ncan automatically download content from scripts or cron-jobs. Files that\nare already downloaded will be skipped.\n\nTODO: Support will be added for specifying several URLs at the same\ntime, either from stdin or from file.\n\nConfigurable download directory\n-------------------------------\n\nIf you don't specify anything, the files and directories will be created\ninside ``~/Downloads/nrkdownload``, where ``~`` means your home\ndirectory. If you want the downloads somewhere else (e.g. directly to\nyour NAS), there are two ways to specify a different download directory:\n- Define an environment variable named ``NRKDOWNLOAD_DIR`` - Specify the\ndownload directory on the command line with the option\n``-d download_dir``\n\nIf you do both at the same time, the option from the command line will\ntake precedence.\n\nIf you don't know how to define an environment variable under your\noperating system, try to Google ``create environment variable`` and the\nname of you operating system. (Under Linux and MacOS, you would want to\nedit your ``~/.bash_profile``)\n\nInstalling\n==========\n\nThe nrkdownload package and its requirements can be installed in several\nways, depending on whether you want to just use it or whether you want\nto change the code. And since it is compatible with both Python 2 and 3,\nyou can decide under what version of Python you want to run it.\n\nAll operating systems\n---------------------\n\nIn general, you should try to avoid installing python packages as root\n(Administrator), and keep your global Python-installation clean (and\nunder control of you OS package manager (like rpm or deb)). This can be\nachieved in several ways:\n\n1. Install Python packages under your own home-directory by passing the\n   ``--user`` option to the ``pip`` installer.\n2. Install your own user-specific Python distribution, where you can\n   later install packages.\n   `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__ is a good choice.\n   It also has good support for environments (see next).\n3. Create a virtual environment using `standard\n   Python <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`__ or\n   `conda <https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html>`__ (used by Anaconda)\n   and install packages in there.\n\nSpecial considerations for MacOS (OS X)\n---------------------------------------\n\nMacOS comes by default with an installation of Python 2.7. You can\ndecide to go with this (i.e. not installing Anaconda as mentioned\nabove). In order to install packages you need the package installer\n``pip``, and under MacOS ``pip`` is not installed by default. You can\ninstall it by typing ``sudo easy_install pip``. In order to utilize the\n``--user`` scheme described above, you must also add\n``~/Library/Python/2.7/bin`` to your $PATH (edit your\n``~/.bash_profile``). This enables installed Python scripts (like\nnrkdownload) to be available in the Terminal.\n\nAlso, if you get an ``UnicodeEncodeError``, add the following line to\nyour \u00a0``~/.bash_profile``: ``export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8``\n\nSpecial considerations for Linux\n--------------------------------\n\nYour system might have both Python 2 and 3 installed as a part of the\nLinux-distribution. If Python 2 is the default, ``pip`` will be pointing\nto the Python 2 installation, whereas ``pip3`` will point to the Python\n3 installation. If that is the case for you, and you explicitly want to\nrun nrkdownload under Python 3, you must replace ``pip`` with ``pip3``\nin the examples below.\n\nSpecial considerations for Windows\n----------------------------------\n\nWindows does not come with an installation of Python. You can choose to\ninstall version 2.7.x or the latest 3.x from\n`python.org <https://www.python.org/>`__. If you want to learn and\ndevelop Python I would suggest\n`Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__, which installs in\nyour home-directory and comes with a nice selection of packages.\n\nInstalling the latest release of nrkdownload\n--------------------------------------------\n\nIn the following examples, packages are installed with the `user\nscheme <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#user-installs>`__\ndescribed in example 1 above.\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install --user nrkdownload\n\nIf you at some point want to upgrade to a newer version, just add a\n``-U`` (for Upgrade):\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install -U --user nrkdownload\n\nInstalling the latest revision directly from GitHub:\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install --user git+https://github.com/marhoy/nrk-download.git#egg=nrkdownload\n\nIf you at some point want to upgrade to a newer version, use ``-U`` as\ndescribed above.\n\nInstalling in development mode:\n-------------------------------\n\nIf you want to change (and possibly contribute to) the code, first clone\nthe repository. This will create a directory containing a local copy of\nthe GitHub-repository. Then install in develop mode from this directory:\n\n::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/marhoy/nrk-download.git\n    $ pip install --user -e nrk-download\n\nYou will then be able to use the tool as usual, but the installation\nwill be a pointer to your local repository. Whatever changes you make in\nyour local repository will have immediate effect on the \"installation\".\n\nUninstalling nrkdownload\n========================\n\nTo unistall nrkdownload, just type:\n\n::\n\n    $ pip uninstall nrkdownload\n\nNOTE: This will not uninstall the required packages that might have been\ninstalled together with nrkdownload. Type ``pip list --user`` to list\nall user-installed packages, and uninstall them if you know that you\ndon't need them anymore.\n\nFFmpeg\n======\n\nThe videos and subtitles are downloaded using\n`FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/>`__. It is available for all major\noperating systems. You need to install ffmpeg and make it available in\nyour $PATH before you can use nrkdownload.\n\nFor Linux\n---------\n\nDepending on your Linux-distribution, you might have to add a\npackage-repository in order to install ffmpeg. If you get stuck, try too\nGoogle ``installing ffmpeg for YOUR_LINUX_DISTRO``.\n\nFor MacOS\n---------\n\nDownload the static build of the latest release (currently 3.2.2). Open\nthe .dmg-file and copy the binary file ``ffmpeg`` to e.g. a directory\n``bin`` inside your home directory. Then, add ~/bin to your PATH.\n\nMore metadata?\n--------------\n\nThe m4v-format has support for builtin metadata. We could add some\ninformation there. Also: Both series and programs/episodes have a\ndescription at tv.nrk.no. It could possibly be interesting to save these\ndescriptions to a text file.",
