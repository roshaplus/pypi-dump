    "description": "Balbuzard\n=========\n\n`Balbuzard <http://www.decalage.info/python/balbuzard>`_ is a package of\nmalware analysis tools in python to extract patterns of interest from\nsuspicious files (IP addresses, domain names, known file headers,\ninteresting strings, etc). It can also crack malware obfuscation such as\nXOR, ROL, etc by bruteforcing and checking for those patterns.\n\nQuick links:\n`Download <http://bitbucket.org/decalage/balbuzard/downloads>`_ -\n`Install <https://bitbucket.org/decalage/balbuzard/wiki/Installation>`_\n- `Documentation <https://bitbucket.org/decalage/balbuzard/wiki>`_ -\n`Contact <http://www.decalage.info/contact>`_ - `Report\nissues <https://bitbucket.org/decalage/balbuzard/issues?status=new&status=open>`_\n- `Updates on Twitter <https://twitter.com/decalage2>`_\n\nBalbuzard tools:\n----------------\n\n-  `balbuzard <https://bitbucket.org/decalage/balbuzard/wiki/balbuzard/>`_\n   is a tool to extract patterns of interest from malicious files, such\n   as IP addresses, URLs, embedded files and typical malware strings. It\n   is easily extensible with new patterns, regular expressions and Yara\n   rules.\n-  `bbcrack <https://bitbucket.org/decalage/balbuzard/wiki/bbcrack/>`_\n   uses a new algorithm based on patterns of interest to bruteforce\n   typical malware obfuscation such as XOR, ROL, ADD and various\n   combinations, in order to guess which algorithms/keys have been used.\n-  `bbharvest <https://bitbucket.org/decalage/balbuzard/wiki/bbharvest/>`_\n   extracts all patterns of interest found when applying typical malware\n   obfuscation transforms such as XOR, ROL, ADD and various\n   combinations, trying all possible keys. It is especially useful when\n   several keys or several transforms are used in a single file.\n-  `bbtrans <https://bitbucket.org/decalage/balbuzard/wiki/bbtrans/>`_\n   can apply any of the transforms from bbcrack (XOR, ROL, ADD and\n   various combinations) to a file.\n\nWhen to use these tools:\n------------------------\n\n-  If you need to analyze a new malicious file, you can first try\n   `balbuzard <https://bitbucket.org/decalage/balbuzard/wiki/balbuzard/>`_\n   to extract strings/patterns of interest and detect embedded files in\n   cleartext.\n-  Then if you think the malicious file might use an obfuscation\n   algorithm such as XOR to hide interesting data (e.g. an embedded\n   executable file), try\n   `bbcrack <https://bitbucket.org/decalage/balbuzard/wiki/bbcrack/>`_\n   to find the algorithm and the key(s).\n-  Alternatively, if bbcrack is not successful, or if you think the file\n   may use several algorithms and/or keys, try\n   `bbharvest <https://bitbucket.org/decalage/balbuzard/wiki/bbharvest/>`_.\n   bbharvest is especially targeted at single strings obfuscated within\n   an executable or malicious file.\n\n5 minutes demo\n--------------\n\nSee the `Demo <https://bitbucket.org/decalage/balbuzard/wiki/Demo/>`_\npage to see examples and test the tools by yourself in a few minutes\nusing the provided samples.\n\nHelp wanted:\n------------\n\n-  if you have malware samples or malicious documents with known\n   obfuscation algorithms such as XOR, please `contact\n   me <http://www.decalage.info/contact>`_. That will help me a lot to\n   improve bbcrack and bbharvest.\n-  if you know other strings, patterns, file headers useful for malware\n   analysis that Balbuzard should support, or other obfuscation\n   algorithms, please `contact me <http://www.decalage.info/contact>`_.\n\nSee http://www.decalage.info/python/balbuzard for more info and other\ntools.\n\n--------------\n\nNews\n====\n\nFollow all updates and news on Twitter: https://twitter.com/decalage2\n\n-  2014-03-23 v0.19: bugfix when Yara is not installed, improved\n   `documentation <https://bitbucket.org/decalage/balbuzard/wiki>`_.\n-  2014-02-26 v0.18: Initial release of Balbuzard tools\n-  2013-03-15: added harvest mode (bbharvest)\n-  2011-05-06: added bruteforce functions (bbcrack)\n-  2008-06-06: first public release as\n   `reScan <http://decalage.info/rescan>`_ for\n   `SSTIC08 <http://decalage.info/sstic08>`_\n-  2007-07-11: first versions of reScan\n-  see changelog in source code for more info.\n\nDownload\n========\n\nThe archive is available on `the project page on\nBitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/decalage/balbuzard/downloads>`_.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nSee the `installation\ninstructions <https://bitbucket.org/decalage/balbuzard/wiki/Installation>`_.\n\nHow to contribute / report bugs / ask for help:\n===============================================\n\nThese are open-source tools developed on my spare time. Any contribution\nsuch as code improvements, ideas, bug reports, additional patterns or\ntransforms would be highly appreciated. You may contact me using `this\nonline form <http://www.decalage.info/contact>`_, by e-mail (decalage at\nlaposte.net) or use the `issue page on\nBitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/decalage/balbuzard/issues?status=new&status=open>`_\nto report bugs/ideas, or clone the project then send me pull requests to\nsuggest changes.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nThis license applies to the whole Balbuzard package including balbuzard,\nbbcrack, bbharvest and bbtrans, apart from the thirdparty and plugins\nfolders which contain third-party files published with their own\nlicense.\n\nThe Balbuzard package is copyright (c) 2007-2014, Philippe Lagadec\n(http://www.decalage.info) All rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are\nmet:\n\n-  Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n   notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n-  Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n   notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n   documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS\nIS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
