But the problem is to know which are the applicable ones.\n\nOdoo already includes a method in its mass mailing logic that avoids to resend\nthe same mail 2 times for one mass mailing, and for v9, there was a trick that\nallows to modify the state of a mass mailing from kanban view, covering the\nneed.\n\nBut now on v10 both status bar in form view and dragging between states in\nkanban are not allowed.\n\nThis module introduces a button to restart a mass mailing to draft state,\nallowing you to reevaluate the sending domain or list for performing again\nthe mailing.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n* Go to *Mass mailing > Mailings > Mass Mailings*.\n* Click on one record that is done or create a new one and send it.\n* You will see a button called \"Resend\".\n* If you click on it, mass mailing will be set to Draft again.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/205/10.0\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/social/issues>`_. In case of trouble, please\ncheck there if your issue has already been reported. If you spotted it first,\nhelp us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed feedback.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* Add an indicator / filter for knowing resent mailings.\n* Include information on the number of new recipients to be sent on the\n  resending (through `get_remaining_recipients` method).\n\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n* Tecnativa (https://www.tecnativa.com):\n  * Pedro M.
