    "description": "===============================\nIotronic Panels\n===============================\n\nIotronic plugin for the OpenStack Dashboard\n\n* Free software: Apache license\n* Source: http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/iotronic-ui\n* Bugs: http://bugs.launchpad.net/iotronic-ui\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* TODO\n\nEnabling in DevStack\n--------------------\n\nAdd this repo as an external repository into your ``local.conf`` file::\n\n    [[local|localrc]]\n    enable_plugin iotronic-ui https://github.com/openstack/iotronic-ui\n\nManual Installation\n-------------------\n\nBegin by cloning the Horizon and Iotronic Panels repositories::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/openstack/horizon\n    git clone https://github.com/openstack/iotronic-ui\n\nCreate a virtual environment and install Horizon dependencies::\n\n    cd horizon\n    python tools/install_venv.py\n\nSet up your ``local_settings.py`` file::\n\n    cp openstack_dashboard/local/local_settings.py.example openstack_dashboard/local/local_settings.py\n\nOpen up the copied ``local_settings.py`` file in your preferred text\neditor. You will want to customize several settings:\n\n-  ``OPENSTACK_HOST`` should be configured with the hostname of your\n   OpenStack server. Verify that the ``OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_URL`` and\n   ``OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_DEFAULT_ROLE`` settings are correct for your\n   environment. (They should be correct unless you modified your\n   OpenStack server to change them.)\n\nInstall Iotronic Panels with all dependencies in your virtual environment::\n\n    tools/with_venv.sh pip install -e ../iotronic-ui/\n\nAnd enable it in Horizon::\n\n    ln -s ../iotronic-ui/iotronic_ui/enabled/_90_project_iot_panelgroup.py openstack_dashboard/local/enabled\n    ln -s ../iotronic-ui/iotronic_ui/enabled/_91_project_iot_boardss_panel.py openstack_dashboard/local/enabled\n\nTo run horizon with the newly enabled Iotronic Panels plugin run::\n\n    ./run_tests.sh --runserver 0.0.0.0:8080\n\nto have the application start on port 8080 and the horizon dashboard will be\navailable in your browser at http://localhost:8080/",
