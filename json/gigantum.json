It provides a\nsimple command line interface to install, update, start, and stop the application. Currently this is only targeting\nalpha testers and not generally available yet.\n\nIf you encounter any issues or have any questions, do not hesitate in contacting Gigantum for help. \n\n## Prerequisites\n\n1. **Python**\n\n    This tool requires that you have Python installed on your system. It works with Python 2.7 and 3.4+. \n\n2. **Docker**\n\n    Gigantum requires the free Docker Community Edition to be installed to run locally on your computer. You do not need\n    to keep Docker running at all times, but it must be open before you start the Gigantum application and can be closed\n    after you stop the Gigantum application.    \n\n    If you don't already have Docker, you can install it directly from the \n    Docker [website](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)\n\n    - Windows:\n        - **NOTE: Windows is temporarily not supported. Fixes are coming in the next release**\n        - Requires Microsoft Windows 10 Professional or Enterprise 64-bit\n        - [https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)\n\n    - Mac:\n        - Docker for Mac works on OS X El Capitan 10.11 and newer macOS releases.\n        - [https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)\n\n    - Ubuntu:\n        - (Recommended Method) Install using Docker's \"helper\" script, which will perform all install steps for you:\n\n            ```bash\n            cd ~\n            curl -fsSL get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh\n            sudo sh get-docker.sh\n            ``` \n        - **OR** install manually, following the instructions here: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)\n            - Typical installations will use the `amd64` option in step 4 of \"Setup The Repository\"\n            - You can skip step 3 of install Docker CE\n        - Regardless of the install method used above, it is required that you add your normal user account to the Docker user group \n        so that you can run Docker commands without elevated privileges. Run the following command and then logout and back \n        into your system for changes to take effect.\n\n            ```\n            sudo usermod -aG docker <your username>\n            ```\n\n            - Note, Docker provides this warning when doing this, which in most cases is not an issue:\n\n                ```\n                WARNING: Adding a user to the \"docker\" group will grant the ability to run\n                containers which can be used to obtain root privileges on the\n                docker host.\n                Refer to https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface\n                for more information.\n                ```\n\n3. **Sign-In to DockerHub**\n\n    Since the Gigantum application is still a closed alpha, you must be granted access to the Docker image. To do so, \n    first create a free DockerHub account at [https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/) and **send your username to Gigantum**.\n\n    Start your Docker application. Open the Docker menu by clicking on the app icon in your system tray or taskbar. Click on Sign-In in the Docker menu, and enter your DockerHub credentials.\n\n    ![sign in](docs/img/docker-signin.png)\n\n3. **(Optional) Adjust Docker Resources**\n\n\tYou can configure the amount of CPU and RAM allocated to Docker by clicking on `Preferences > Advanced` from the Docker Menu. Docker will use *up to* the amount specified when operating. \n\n\t![preferences](docs/img/resources.png)\n\n## Install the CLI\n\nThis package is available for install via `pip`. It runs on Python 2 and 3 and supports Windows, OSX and Linux. Currently,\nWindows support is limited to Windows 10 Professional.\n\n1. To isolate this installation from your system Python, it is often best to create a virtual environment first.\nThis is not required, but recommended if you feel comfortable enough with Python. The Gigantum CLI installs a minimal set of \nPython dependencies, so in general should be safe to simply install if preferred.\n\n\tUsing [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):\n\n\t```\n\tmkvirtualenv gigantum\n\t```\n\n2. Install Gigantum CLI\n\n\t```\n\tworkon gigantum\n\tpip install -U gigantum\n\t```\n\n\n## Commands\n\nThe Gigantum CLI provides a few simple commands to support installation, updating, and use. When the `pip` package is installed,\nthe Gigantum CLI is installed as a globally available script called `gigantum`. \n\nUsage of the CLI then becomes:\n\n```\n> gigantum [-h] [--tag <tag>] action\n```\n\n#### Actions\n\n- `install`\n    - **Run this command after installing the CLI for the first time.**\n    - Depending on your bandwidth, installing for the first time can take a while as the Docker Image layers are downloaded.\n    - This command installs the Gigantum application Docker Image for the first time and configures your working directory.\n\n        The Gigantum working directory changes based on your operating system:\n\n        - Windows: `C:\\\\Users\\<username>\\gigantum`\n        - OSX: `/Users/<username>/gigantum`\n        - Linux: `/home/<username>/gigantum`\n\n- `update`\n    - This command updates an existing installation to the latest version of the application\n    - If you have the latest version, nothing happens, so it is safe to run this command at any time.\n    - When you run `update`, the changelog for the new version is displayed and you are asked to confirm the upload before it begins.\n    - Optionally, you can use the `--tag` option to install a specific version instead of the latest\n\n- `start`\n    - This command starts the Gigantum application\n    - Once started, the application User Inteface is available at [http://localhost:10000](http://localhost:10000)\n    - Currently, any running Jupyter instance will be available at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) once launched\n\n- `stop`\n    - This command currently stops the Gigantum Application and *ALL* Docker containers on your computer\n\n- `feedback`\n    - This command opens a browser to a feedback form where you can report bugs, suggestions, desired features, etc.\n\n## Usage\n\n### User Account\nTo use the Gigantum application you must have a Gigantum user account. When you run the application for the first time, you can register. \n\nNote that you'll get an extra warning about granting the application access to your account when you sign in for the first time. This is an extra security measure that occurs because the app is running on localhost and not a verified domain and is expected.\n\nOnce you login, your user identity is cached locally. This lets you run the application when disconnected from the internet and without logging in again. If you logout, you will not be able to use the application again until you have internet access and can re-authenticate.\n\n### Typical Work Flow\n\nAfter everything is installed, a typical usage would follow a workflow like this:\n\n- Start the Docker app if it is not already running\n- Open a terminal\n- Activate your virtualenv (if setup)\n\n\t```\n\tworkon gigantum\n\t```\n- Start the application\n\n\t```\n\tgigantum start\n\t```\n- A browser will open to [http://localhost:10000](http://localhost:10000)\n- Perform your desired work\n- When complete, stop the application\n\n\t```\n\tgigantum stop\n\t```\n- If desired, quit the Docker app\n\n\n\n### Sharing \n\nCurrently, sharing is limited to an export/import workflow. If you want to share a LabBook with someone, click on the Export button in the LabBook Overview page.\n\nThis will download a `.lbk` archive file to the `export` directory in your Gigantum working directory. You can then share this file with someone else.\n\nTo import, simply drag-and-drop the `.lbk` file into the Import area in the LabBook Overview page. Note that if the file is large, import can take a little while.\n\nYou cannot duplicate LabBooks. If you want to import a LabBook \"on top\" of an existing LabBook, currently you'll have to rename the original LabBook before Import.\n\n## Providing Feedback\n\nIf you encounter any issues using the Gigantum CLI, submit them to this [GitHub repository issues page](https://github.com/gigantum/gigantum-cli/issues).\n\nIf you encounter any issues or have any feedback while using the the Gigantum Application, use the feedback command to open the feedback form.\n\nFor urgent issues, contact Gigantum.\n\n",
