    "description": "Introduction\n------------\n\nRez is a cross-platform, LGPL Licensed python library and set of utilities for building and installing packages, and resolving environments containing these packages at runtime, avoiding version conflicts. The main tools are:\n\n-  **rez-env** - Creates a configured shell containing a set of requested packages. Supports **bash** and **tcsh**, and mimics the startup sequences of the native shell.\n\n-  **rez-build** - Builds a package of any type (python, C++ etc), and installs it locally for testing. Supports **cmake**.\n\n-  **rez-release** - Builds and centrally deploys a package, and updates the associated source control repository (creating tags etc). Supports **git**, **mercurial** and **svn**.\n\nUnlike many packaging systems, Rez is able to install many different versions of the same packages. When you use the rez-env tool, a new environment is dynamically created, containing the requested packages. Rez resolves environments at runtime, rather than install time - however, you are able to store a resolve to disk, and reuse it at a later date.\n\nHere's an example which places the user into a resolved shell containing the requested packages:\n\n::\n\n    ]$ rez-env requests-2.2+ python-2.6 'pymongo-0+<2.7'\n    \n    You are now in a rez-configured environment.\n    \n    resolved by ajohns@nn188.somewhere.com, on Wed Feb 26 15:56:20 2014, using Rez v2.0.0\n    \n    implicit packages:\n    platform-linux\n    arch-x86_64\n    \n    requested packages:\n    requests-2.2+\n    python-2.6\n    pymongo-0+<2.7\n    \n    resolved packages:\n    python-2.6.8    /software/ext/python/2.6.8\n    platform-linux  /software/ext/platform/linux\n    requests-2.2.1  /software/ext/requests/2.2.1/python-2.6\n    pymongo-2.6.3   /software/ext/pymongo/2.6.3\n    arch-x86_64     /software/ext/arch/x86_64\n    \n    > ]$ _\n    \nHere's an example which creates an environment containing the package 'houdini' version 12.5 or greater, and runs the command 'hescape -h' inside that environment:\n\n::\n\n    ]$ rez-env -c 'hescape -h' houdini-12.5+\n    Usage: hescape [-foreground] [-s editor] [filename ...]\n    -h: output this usage message\n    -f: force the use of asset definitions in OTL files on the command line\n    -s: specify starting desktop by name\n    -foreground: starts process in foreground\n    \nResolved environments can also be created programmatically:\n\n::\n\n    >>> from rez.resolved_context import ResolvedContext\n    >>>\n    >>> r = ResolvedContext([\"houdini-12.5+\", \"houdini-0+<13\", \"java\", \"!java-1.8+\"])\n    >>>\n    >>> r.print_info()\n    resolved by ajohns@nn188.somewhere.com, on Wed Feb 26 13:03:30 2014, using Rez v2.0.0\n    \n    implicit packages:\n    platform-linux\n    arch-x86_64\n    \n    requested packages:\n    houdini-12.5+\n    houdini-0+<13\n    java\n    \n    resolved packages:\n    java-1.7.21       /software/ext/java/1.7.21\n    platform-linux    /software/ext/platform/linux\n    arch-x86_64       /software/ext/arch/x86_64\n    houdini-12.5.562  /software/ext/houdini/12.5.562\n    >>>\n    >>> import subprocess\n    >>> p = r.execute_shell(command='which hescape', stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\n    >>> stdout,stderr = p.communicate()\n    >>>\n    >>> print stdout\n    '/software/ext/houdini/12.5.562/bin/hescape'\n    \n    \nFeatures\n--------\n\n-  Supports Linux and OSX;\n-  Allows for a fast and efficient build-install-test cycle;\n-  Creates shells of type: bash, tcsh, other (shells can be added as plugins);\n-  Contains a deployment system supporting git, mercurial and svn (as plugins);\n-  Environment resolves can be saved to disk and reused at a later date (a bit like VirtualEnv);\n-  Highly pluggable, supports five different plugin types to do things from adding new shell types, to adding new build systems;\n-  Contains a version resolving algorithm, for avoiding version clashes;\n-  Visualises resolved environments in a rendered dot-graph;\n-  Packages are found in a search path, so different packages can be deployed to different locations;\n-  Supports alphanumeric version numbers;\n-  Has a powerful version requirements syntax, able to describe any version range, and a conflict operator for rejecting version ranges;\n-  Package 'variants' - a way to define different flavors of the same package version, for example a plugin built for multiple versions of the host app;\n-  Custom release hooks (such as post-release operations) can be added as plugins;\n-  Has a time lock feature, which allows old resolves to be recreated (newer packages are ignored);\n-  Package definitions are a single, succinct file;\n-  Packages define their effect on the environment (adding to PATH etc) in a platform- and shell- agnostic way, using a dedicated python API;\n-  Has a memcached-based caching system, for caching environment resolves.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install Rez, simply:\n\n::\n\n    pip install rez\n    \nOr, to install from source:\n\n::\n\n    python setup.py install\n    \nTo see that it's working:\n\n::\n\n    ]$ rez-env -c 'hello_world' hello_world\n    Hello Rez World!\n    \nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nTODO\n",
