Mismatching content is synced in the direction the user specifies.\n        \n            * https://github.com/B-Con/flickrsyncr\n            * https://bradconte.com/flickrsyncr\n            * https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flickrsyncr\n        \n        Setup\n        =====\n        \n        1. Obtain a Flickr API KEY. Starting point: <https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply>.\n        \n        2.     Save the API key and secret in a config file (unless you will provide it on the cmd-line or in the ``Settings()`` object).\n        \n               *     The config file at ``~/.config/flickrsyncr/config.conf`` will used by default unless an alternative path is specified via ``--config_path``. Sample config file content::\n        \n                         [DEFAULT]\n                         api_key = 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef\n                         api_secret = 0123456789abcdef\n        \n            * Multiple API key/secret pairs can be stored under different profile names. The ``DEFAULT`` profile will be used by default unless an alternative profile name is specified via ``--config_profile``.\n        \n        3. On the first run of the app, human involvement is necessary to authorize the app for Flickr OAuth. The app will automatically open a web browser with the Flickr app permissions prompt. The Flickr account the user is signed into during this process is the account that flickrsyncr will use.\n        \n        Usage\n        =====\n        \n        Command-line application\n        ------------------------\n        \n        Basics:\n        \n        * Only the local ``--path`` and Flickr ``--album`` are required.\n        * One of ``--push`` or ``--pull`` is required.\n        * Use ``--help`` to list all options.\n        \n        Examples:\n        \n        * Force the Flickr album contents to exactly match local dir based only on file name::\n        \n            $ flickrsyncr --album=albumname --path=/my/dir --push --sync\n        \n        * Force the Flickr album contents to exactly match local dir based on file name and checksum::\n        \n            $ flickrsyncr --album=albumname --path=/my/dir --push --sync --checksum\n        \n        * Add local files into a Flickr album::\n        \n            $ flickrsyncr --album=albumname --path=/my/dir --push\n        \n        * Add local files into a Flickr album and tag them all::\n        \n            $ flickrsyncr --album=albumname --path=/my/dir --push --tag=mycustomtag\n        \n        * See what would change if a Flickr album were added to a local directory::\n        \n            $ flickrsyncr --album=albumname --path=/my/dir --pull --dryrun\n        \n        Library\n        -------\n        \n        Objects of interest:\n        \n        * ``flickrsyncr.Settings`` - A class containing all necessary settings.
