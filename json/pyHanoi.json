    "description": "pyHanoi is a Python module which uses an iterative approach to solve the \"Towers of Hanoi\" game.\r\nBut instead of running through the shortest possible solution, pyHanoi offers the option to stop the game after a defined move or a defined number of moves and to show the state of the game at this stage. After that, game can be continued.\r\npyHanoi works with Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.",
