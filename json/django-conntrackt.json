The\ngenerated rules can be easily applied using the *iptables-restore* utility.\n\n\nFeatures\n========\n\nIn short, Conntrackt provides support for the following:\n\n* Multiple independent projects\n* Grouping entities inside of project by location\n* Entities can be individual devices or networks\n* Entities can have multiple network interfaces\n* *iptables* rule generation (per-entity/location/project)\n\nFor more information, please have a look at full documentation at one of the\nfollowing websites:\n\n* https://rtd.majic.rs/\n* http://django-conntrackt.readthedocs.org/\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nDjango Conntrackt *application* is licensed under the terms of GPLv3, or (at\nyour option) any later version.
