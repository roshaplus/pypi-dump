    "description": "Wagtail StreamForms\n===================\n\n|CircleCI| |Coverage Status|\n\nThis package is currently a concept but allows you to add add forms that\nare built in the cms admin area to any streamfield. You can also create\nyour own form templates which will then appear as a template choice when\nyou build your form. This allows you to decide how the form is submitted\nand to where.\n\nDocumentation is currently being worked on but the basics are below\n\nWhats included?\n---------------\n\n-  Forms can be built in the cms admin and used site wide in any\n   streamfield.\n-  You can create your own form templates to display/submit how ever you\n   wish to do it.\n-  We have included a mixin which will handle the form post if it is\n   being submitted to a wagtail page.\n-  Forms are catagorised by their class in the cms admin for easier\n   navigation.\n-  Form submissions are also listed by their form which you can filter\n   by date and are ordered by newest first.\n-  Recaptcha can be added to a form.\n-  You can also add site wide regex validators fo use in regex fields.\n\nScreen shots\n------------\n\n.. figure:: https://github.com/AccentDesign/wagtailstreamforms/raw/master/images/screen1.png\n   :alt: Screen1\n\n.. figure:: https://github.com/AccentDesign/wagtailstreamforms/raw/master/images/screen2.png\n   :alt: Screen2\n\n.. figure:: https://github.com/AccentDesign/wagtailstreamforms/raw/master/images/screen3.png\n   :alt: Screen3\n\n.. figure:: https://github.com/AccentDesign/wagtailstreamforms/raw/master/images/screen4.png\n   :alt: Screen4\n\n.. figure:: https://github.com/AccentDesign/wagtailstreamforms/raw/master/images/screen5.png\n   :alt: Screen5\n\nGeneral setup\n-------------\n\nAdd wagtailstreamforms to your INSTALLED\\_APPS:\n\n::\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = [\n        ...\n        'wagtailstreamforms'\n        ...\n    ]\n\nNext define the form templates in your settings.py:\n\n::\n\n    # this is the defaults \n    WAGTAILSTREAMFORMS_FORM_TEMPLATES = (\n        ('streamforms/form_block.html', 'Default Form Template'),\n    )\n\nand if you want to the admin base area label:\n\n::\n\n    # this is the default\n    WAGTAILSTREAMFORMS_ADMIN_MENU_LABEL = 'Streamforms'\n\nAdd the urls to urls.py:\n\n::\n\n    from wagtailstreamforms import urls as streamforms_urls\n\n    urlpatterns = [\n        ...\n        url(r'^streamforms/', include(streamforms_urls)),\n        ...\n    ]\n\nOptionally enable recaptcha\n---------------------------\n\nHas been enabled via the\n`django-recaptcha <https://github.com/praekelt/django-recaptcha>`__\npackage. Please note that only one recapcha should be used per page,\nthis is a known issue and we are looking to fix it.\n\nJust add captcha to your INSTALLED_APPS:\n\n::\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = [\n        ...\n        'captcha'\n        ...\n    ]\n\nAdd the required keys in your settings.py which you can get from\ngoogle's recapcha service:\n\n::\n\n    RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY = 'xxx'\n    RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY = 'xxx'\n     \n    # To use the new No Captcha reCaptcha\n    NOCAPTCHA = True\n\nDefining your own form functionality\n------------------------------------\n\nCurrently we have defined two different types of forms one which just\nenables saving the submission and one to addionally email the results of\nthe submission, As shown\n`here <https://github.com/AccentDesign/wagtailstreamforms/blob/master/wagtailstreamforms/models/form.py#L112>`__.\n\nYou can easily add your own all you have to do is create a model that\ninherits from our form base class add any addional fields/properties and\nthis will be added to the cms admin area.\n\nExample:\n\n::\n\n    from wagtailstreamforms.models import BaseForm\n\n    class SomeForm(BaseForm):\n\n        def process_form_submission(self, form):\n            super(SomeForm, self).process_form_submission(form) # handles the submission saving\n            # do your own stuff here\n\nChoosing a form in a streamfield\n--------------------------------\n\nThe below is an example of a page model with the form block in a stream\nfield. It inherits from our form submission mixin fo that the forms can\nbe posted to the page they appear on.\n\n::\n\n    from wagtail.wagtailadmin.edit_handlers import StreamFieldPanel\n    from wagtail.wagtailcore.fields import StreamField\n    from wagtail.wagtailcore.models import Page\n    from wagtailstreamforms.blocks import WagtailFormBlock\n    from wagtailstreamforms.models import StreamFormPageMixin\n\n\n    class BasicPage(StreamFormPageMixin, Page):\n\n        body = StreamField([\n            ('form', WagtailFormBlock())\n        ])\n\n        content_panels = Page.content_panels + [\n            StreamFieldPanel('body'),\n        ]\n\nExample site with docker\n------------------------\n\nRun the docker container\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ docker-compose up\n\nCreate yourself a superuser\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ docker exec -it <container_name> bash\n    $ python manage.py createsuperuser\n\nGo to http://127.0.0.1:8000\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nInstall dependencies\n\nYou will need pyenv installed see https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv\n\nAlso tox needs to be installed\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install tox\n\nInstall python versions in pyenv\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pyenv install 3.4.4\n    $ pyenv install 3.5.3\n    $ pyenv install 3.6.2\n\nSet local project versions\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pyenv local 3.4.4 3.5.3 3.6.2\n\nRun the tests\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ tox\n\nor run for a single environment\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ tox -e py36-dj111-wt112\n\n.. |CircleCI| image:: https://circleci.com/gh/AccentDesign/wagtailstreamforms/tree/master.svg?style=svg\n   :target: https://circleci.com/gh/AccentDesign/wagtailstreamforms/tree/master\n.. |Coverage Status| image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/AccentDesign/wagtailstreamforms/badge.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/AccentDesign/wagtailstreamforms?branch=master\n",
