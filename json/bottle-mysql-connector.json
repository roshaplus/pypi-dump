    "description": "Bottle-MySQL-Connector simplifies the use of mysql databases in your Bottle applications using MySQL Connector/Python, a self-contained Python driver for communicating with MySQL servers.\r\n\r\nTo automatically detect routes that need a database connection, the plugin searches for route callbacks that require a db keyword argument (configurable) and skips routes that do not. This removes any overhead for routes that don't need a database connection.",
