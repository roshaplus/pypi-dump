    "description": "What is loom?\n=============\n\nLoom is a platform-independent tool to create, execute, track, and share workflows.\n\nWhy use Loom?\n=============\n\nEase of use\n-----------\n\nLoom runs out-of-the-box locally or in the cloud.\n\nRepeatable analysis\n-------------------\n\nLoom makes sure you can repeat your analysis months and years down the road after you've lost your notebook, your data analyst has found a new job, and your server has had a major OS version upgrade.\n\nLoom uses Docker to reproduce your runtime environment, records file hashes to verify analysis inputs, and keeps fully reproducible records of your work.\n\nTraceable results\n-----------------\n\nLoom remembers anything you ever run and can tell you exactly how each result was produced.\n\nPortability between platforms\n-----------------------------\n\nExactly the same workflow can be run on your laptop or on a public cloud service.\n\nOpen architecture\n-----------------\n\nNot only is Loom open source and free to use, it uses an inside-out architecture that minimizes lock-in and lets you easily share your work with other people.\n\n- Write your results to a traditional filesystem or object store and browse them outside of Loom\n- Publish your tools as Docker images\n- Publish your workflows as simple, human-readable documents\n- Collaborate by sharing your workflows and results between Loom servers\n- Connect Loom to multiple file stores without creating redundant copies\n- Efficient re-use of results for redundant analysis steps\n\nHow many times do you really need to run the same analysis on the same inputs? Loom knows which steps in your workflow have already been run and seamlessly integrates previous results with the current run, while still maintaining data provenance and traceability.\n\nGraphical user interface\n------------------------\n\nWhile you may want to automate your analysis from the command line, a graphical user interface is useful for interactively browsing workflows and results.\n\nSecurity and compliance\n-----------------------\n\nLoom is designed with clinical compliance in mind.\n\nWho needs Loom?\n===============\n\nLoom is built for the kind of workflows that bioinformaticians run -- multi-step analyses with large data files passed between steps. But nothing about Loom is specific to bioinformatics.\n\nLoom is scalable and supports individual analysts or large institutions.\n\nGet started\n===========\n\nCheck out our Getting Started Guide and give Loom a try.\n\nhttp://loom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html\n\nWhat is the current status?\n===========================\n\nLoom is under active development. To get involved, contact info@loomengine.org\n\nContributors\n============\n\n- Nathan Hammond\n- Isaac Liao",
