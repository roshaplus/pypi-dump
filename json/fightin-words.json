    "description": "A scikit-learn compliant implementation of Monroe et al.'s  Fightin' Words analysis method.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n- Computes a `(word, z-score)` result for a pair of text corpora.\r\n- Works with scikit-learn estimators and pipelines.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nDistributed via PyPI:\r\n\r\n.. code:: bash\r\n\r\n  pip install fightin-words\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n`fightin-words` implements `FWExtractor`, which inherits from the scikit-learn `BaseEstimator` and `TransformerMixin`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n.. code:: python\r\n\r\n  import fightin-words as fw\r\n  import sklearn.feature_extraction.text as sk_text\r\n\r\n  # Strings/text corpora to be compared\r\n  l1 = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy pig'\r\n  l2 = 'The lazy purple pig jumps over the lazier donkey'\r\n\r\n  # Extractor configuration parameters\r\n  prior = 0.05\r\n  cv = sk_text.CountVectorizer(max_features=15000)\r\n\r\n  fw.FWExtractor(prior, cv).fit_transform([l1, l2])\r\n\r\nNote that to maintain parity with scikit-learn conventions, `fit_transform` takes in *one* variable (the canonical `X` for samples/features). Therefore the two strings to be compared should be marshaled into a single sequence-type (list or tuple) variable.\r\n\r\n`prior` and `cv` do not need to be specified. `prior` defaults to 0.01, and `cv` defaults to a naively initialized scikit-learn `CountVectorizer`. If a list of precomputed priors is specified, it is expected that the user also passes in a vectorizer that is responsible for producing a vocabulary whose dimensionality matches the precomputed priors\u2014we do not check for that.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe `original implementation <https://github.com/jmhessel/FightingWords>`_ by Jack Hessel at the Department of Computer Science, Cornell University. This version heavily borrows from it for the core computation. A more eloquent description of the algorithm is available there as well.\r\n\r\nMonroe, B. L., Colaresi, M. P., & Quinn, K. M. (2008).
