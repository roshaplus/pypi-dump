    "description": "==============\nANTS Framework\n==============\n\nANTS is a framework to manage and apply macOS and Linux host configurations using Ansible Pull.\n\nThe ANTS Framework is developed by the Client Services Team of the `University of Basel <https://www.unibas.ch/>`__ `IT Services <https://its.unibas.ch>`__\nand released under the `GNU General Public License Version 3 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html>`__.\n\n`Ansible <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html>`__ is a trademark of `Red Hat, Inc. <https://www.redhat.com>`__.\n\n------------\nIntroduction\n------------\nThe ANTS Framework consists of the following components:\n\n- A wrapper for Ansible-Pull\n- An Ansible Dynamic Inventory Script (MS Active Directory Connector)\n- A modular collection of roles ready to be used\n- Strong logging integration\n\n------------\nRequirements\n------------\nThis project assumes that you are familiar with `Ansible <https://www.ansible.com/>`__\n, `Git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2>`__ and the shell.\n\n---------------\nGetting started\n---------------\n*************************\nInstalling ants using pip\n*************************\n- Make sure ``Git`` is installed on your machine\n- Install the latest ants client using pip: ``pip install ants_client``\n- Pip will install the ANTS client with a default configuration and put the executable in your path.\n\n******************************************\nInstalling ants using macOS .pkg installer\n******************************************\n- Download the latest .pkg installer from the `releases page <https://github.com/ANTS-Framework/ants/releases>`__\n- Execute the installer. This will take care of all dependencies\n- A launch daemon will be installed, running `ants` every 15 minutes. It will trigger after the next restart.\n\n********\nRun ants\n********\n- Open your terminal\n- Start an ANTS run by typing ``ants``.\n- Wait for ANTS to finish, then open another shell. You will see the message of the day.\n\n**************\nWhat happened?\n**************\nRunning ANTS with the default configuration will use ansible-pull to clone\n`the ANTS playbook <https://github.com/ANTS-Framework/playbook>`__ from a github repository and execute an ansible run.\n\nBy default, this will add a message of the day to your macOS or Linux host. Logs of all the runs are stored at ``/var/log/ants``.\n\n----------------------\nWhere to go from here?\n----------------------\n\n-------------------------\nLook at the configuration\n-------------------------\nRun ``ants -h`` to see all command line options or write your own configuration.\n\nBesides the default configuration file in the ants_client package, ANTS\nwill also look for a local configuration file at ``/etc/ants/ants.cfg``.\n\nDo not modify the default configuration file as it might be overwritten when updating ANTS.\n\n---------------\nRun other roles\n---------------\nFork or duplicate `our example playbook <https://github.com/ANTS-Framework/playbook>`__\nand change the client configuration to point to your repository. \nUpdate ``main.yml`` to assign different roles to your hosts.\n\nYou can use the default Ansible syntax. You can also use wildcards. Have a look at the\n`Ansible documentation <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_intro.html>`__\n\n-----------------------------------------\nAdd ssh authentication to your repository\n-----------------------------------------\nAnsible-pull cat clone a git repository using ssh. You can enable this by creating your own private playbook,\nadding ssh authentication and a read only ssh key to the repository.\nConfigure ANTS to use that key.\n\nBy default, ANTS will look for a private key at ``/etc/ants/id_ants``\n\nYou can generate a key with ``ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -N '' -C \"ants client\" -f /etc/ants/id_ants``\n\nBy default, ANTS is configured to run with strict host key checking disabled and will add the host key for github.com to your known_hosts file.\nYou should change this in production. To do so, add ``ssh_stricthostkeychecking = True`` to your ants.cfg\n\n------------------------------\nAdd a dynamic inventory source\n------------------------------\nAnsible supports dynamic inventory scripts. (A json representation of hosts to group mappings.)\n\nYou can use scripts to tell ansible-pull which tasks to run on which host.\nYou need an inventory source and a script that can read and return it in the\n`correct format: <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_inventory.html>`__\n\nBy default, ANTS will run a dummy script ``inventory_default`` that will just return your hostname belonging to a group\nnamed *ants-common*.\n\nBut we also provide ``inventory_ad`` which will connect to your Active Directory and return all groups your\nhost is a member of. Just add your configuration to ``/etc/ants/ants.cfg``. Note that read only rights for the\nActive Directory user are sufficient.\n\nBy using a dynamic inventory source, you can assign roles to a host using AD and let ANTS handle the configuration.\n\n--------------------------------\nGroup Layout in Active Directory\n--------------------------------\nThe groups in Active Directory must have the same names as the mappings and the variables you want to assign\nusing Ansible. We recommend to keep the groups in a dedicated Organizational Unit to prevent naming collisions.\n\nNested groups with access restrictions are an easy way to offer rights delegation to other units in your organization.\n\n-------------------\nWhat else do I need\n-------------------\nNothing. You just set up a configuration management that communicates savely over ssh using your AD and Github.\n\nNo additional infrastructure required.\n\n-------------\nCommunication\n-------------\n- Please use the `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/ANTS-Framework/ants/issues>`__ to file issues.\n- Please use a `GitHub Pull-Request <https://github.com/ANTS-Framework/ants/pulls>`__ to suggest changes.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\nComparison of plain Ansible and Ansible Tower to ANTS\n-----------------------------------------------------\n****************************************\nWhat does ANTS do, that Ansible can not?\n****************************************\n\n- ANTS gives you a set of ready to be used roles for typical macOS and Linux host configurations.\n- ANTS let's you utilize Active Directory to map computers to roles. With all it's delegation and nesting features.\n- ANTS utilizes Ansible Pull and therefore does not require an active network connection to a central server. Roles will be locally applied even if the host is offline. \n\n*********************************************************\nWhat does Ansible or Ansible Tower do that ANTS does not?\n*********************************************************\n\n- Tower has a nice Dashboard\n- Tower has a real time job output and push-button job runs\n- Tower can to job scheduling\n- Tower supports run-time job promoting\n- Tower supports workflows\n- Ansbile can use encrypted secrets using Vault\n- Ansible and Tower do offer Enterprise Support\n\n\n",
