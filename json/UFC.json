    "description": "UFC (Unified Form-assembly Code) is a unified framework for finite element assembly. More precisely, it defines a fixed interface for communicating low level routines (functions) for evaluating and assembling finite element variational forms. The UFC interface consists of a single header file ufc.h that specifies a C++ interface that must be implemented by code that complies with the UFC specification.",
