    "description": "`pedigree` takes a [yaml][] file like that in `examples/example.yaml` ([source][]) and outputs a\nfew messy visualizations that do not favor patriliny over matriliny.  See `examples/` for example output.\n\n![Screenshot 1](media/screenshot1.png)\n![Screenshot 2](media/screenshot2.png)\n\nExample:\n--------\nIf you're in a hurry to play,\n\n    pedigree -y examples/example.yaml\n\nOutputs:\n--------\n  - `.html` file: a [d3][] visualization that can be opened in a web browser\n  - `.svg` file: a \"Sugiyama style\" tree that can be opened in a web browser\n  - `.dot` file: the [dot][] file used to generate the `.svg` file\n\nInstallation:\n-------------\nYou must first install [graphviz][dot] via\n\n    sudo apt-get install [graphviz][dot]\n\nThen,\n\n    pip install pedigree\n\n`pedigree --help` will tell you your options.\n\nCaveats:\n--------\n  - Don't put all your genealogical data in one text file that you manipulate via a python script written by some idiot on the internet.  At least make copies of the one text file.\n  - This can only recognize the relations `x is the mother of y`, `x is the father of y`, and `x is the spouse of y`.  It has no concept of siblings or partial siblings.\n  - The `.yaml` file depends on every name to be unique, so you may need names like `John Smith (2)` and `John Smith (1)`.\n\n\n[yaml]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML\n[d3]: http://d3js.org/\n[dot]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphviz\n[source]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Flintstones_family_tree",
