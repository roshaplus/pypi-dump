    "description": "===========\nGotipy\n===========\n\nGotipy is a tool to efficiently transfer your Google Play Music playlists to Spotify.\nUser can choose from many aggressiveness levels. Typical usage looks like this:\n\n    #!/usr/bin/python3\n\n    from gotipy import user_info, fetcher, migrator\n\n    # 1. Authenticate\n    user = UserInfo()\n    user.spotify_authenticate(spotify_token, spotify_id)\n    user.gpm_authenticate(gpm_email, gpm_password)\n\n    # 2. Open CSV for logging\n    log = open('log.csv', 'a')\n    clerk = csv.writer(log, lineterminator='\\n')\n    clerk.writerow([\"Direction\", \"Aggressiveness\", \"Playlist Number\", \"Playlist Name\",\n                    \"Track Number\", \"Title\", \"Artist\", \"Album\", \"Done\", \"Transferred on Level\",\n                    \"Notes\"])\n\n    # 3. Instantiate fetcher and migrator for fetching and migrating playlists\n    fetcher = FromGpm(clerk, user.gpm) \n    migrator = ToSpotify(clerk, 7, user.spt, user.spotify_id) # CSV \"clerk\", Agr level, Spotify token, Spotify ID, \n\n    # 4. Fetch and choose playlists\n    print(fetcher.playlists_names) # Print available playlists to choose from\n    playlists = input() # Input example: \"1,4,2,5,6,7,4,32\"\n    playlists = fetcher.playlists_choice_check(playlists, reverse=True) # Returns a reversed list of playlists\n    playlists_out = fetcher.playlists_out(playlists) # Gets a list of playlists contents to transfer\n\n    # 5. Migrate playlists and print stats\n    migration_done = migrator.playlists_handler(playlists_out) # Pass it to migrator\n    print(migrator.playlists_found)\n    print(migrator.songs_found)\n    print(migrator.songs_not_found)\n\n\nDependencies\n=========\n\nThis package is built atop:\n\n* Spotify's official python API: Spotipy https://github.com/plamere/spotipy\n* Google Play Music's unofficial python API: Gmusicapi https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi\n\nSetup:\n\n* pip3 install spotipy\n* pip3 install gmusicapi\n* pip3 install gotipy\n\nAggressiveness levels\n-------------\n\nAggressiveness levels will add the first track found if:\n\n  1. Only one search result was found by searching trackss (Title, Artist, Album)\n  2. Only one search result was found by searching track's (Title, Artist)\n  3. Only one search result was found by searching track's (Title, Album)\n  4. Only two search result were found by searching track's (Title, Artist, Album)\n  5. Only two search result were found by searching track's (Title, Artist)\n  6. More than two search results were found by searching track's (Title, Artist, Album)\n  7. Only two search result were found by searching track's (Title, Album)\n  8. More than two search results were found by searching track's (Title, Artist)\n  9 More than two search results were found by searching track's (Title, Album)\n  10. More than two search results were found by searching track's (Title)\n  * Of course, given any aggressiveness level, the program will start searching from agr. level 1 all the way to the agr level user sets as a limit\n\nCSV colomns\n-------------\n\nMigrator will export a CSV with the following rows for each track processed:\n\n  1. Direction\n  2. Aggressiveness level chosen\n  3. Playlist Number\n  4. Playlist Name\n  5. Track Number\n  6. Track Title\n  7. Track Artist\n  8. Track Album\n  9. Whethere track was transferred or not\n  10. On which level it was transferred on\n  11. Notes (Reason why track was not transferred)\n\nMore on https://www.github.com/omarryhan/gotipy\n\n",
