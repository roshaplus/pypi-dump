    "description": "******\r\nHeaper\r\n******\r\n\r\nHeaper is a file organizer for people with large file collections, deployed as a local web server.\r\nIt allows clients of the network to manage files via their meta-data, in order to make finding specific files easier in a large quantity of them.\r\n\r\n**This software is in pre-alpha. Most things don't work and, even if they do, the software might crash and burn anyway.\r\nUse at your own risks.**\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n|license| |health| |status| |coverage| |requirements| |waffle|\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n============\r\nHow it works\r\n============\r\n\r\nHeaper runs on a Python-enabled web server.  \r\nUsing the web UI, monitored locations can be added, either folders or network mounts and \"collections\" of different types using files from these different locations can be created.\r\nEach collection can then have meta-data for each item, either supplied by the user or scraped from an online service.\r\n\r\n============\r\nDependencies\r\n============\r\n\r\nHeaper relies on Python 3 and a few extra libraries to work.  \r\nThese currently are:\r\n\r\n* Flask 0.11.1\r\n* SQLAlchemy 1.0.13\r\n* WTForms 2.1\r\n\r\nA requirements.txt file is included, which will pull everything needed to develop Heaper using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  \r\nIt is recommended to install the libraries and run Heaper in a virtual environment.\r\n\r\n=======================\r\nContribution guidelines\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nThis project tries to respect `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ and `PEP 257 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_ as much as possible.  \r\nWe are aware that it is not always possible to respect them perfectly, but please use PyLint or similar code checkers to ensure that your code is somewhat conform prior to having your pull request merged.  \r\n\r\nYou can find ideas of things to work on in the `Issues <https://github.com/mrtimscampi/Heaper/issues>`_ tab.\r\n\r\n=======\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThis project uses `AdminLTE <https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE>`_ by `Abdullah Almsaeed <https://almsaeedstudio.com/>`_ for the template of the user interface.\r\n\r\n.. |license| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/license/MrTimscampi/Heaper.svg?maxAge=2592000\r\n    :target: https://github.com/MrTimscampi/Heaper/blob/master/readme.rst\r\n    :alt: License\r\n.. |health| image:: https://landscape.io/github/MrTimscampi/Heaper/master/landscape.svg?style=flat\r\n    :target: https://landscape.io/github/MrTimscampi/Heaper/master\r\n    :alt: Code Health\r\n.. |status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/MrTimscampi/Heaper.svg?branch=master\r\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/MrTimscampi/Heaper\r\n   :alt: Build Status\r\n.. |coverage| image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/MrTimscampi/Heaper/badge.svg?branch=master\r\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/MrTimscampi/Heaper?branch=master\r\n   :alt: Coverage Status\r\n.. |requirements| image:: https://requires.io/github/MrTimscampi/Heaper/requirements.svg?branch=master\r\n   :target: https://requires.io/github/MrTimscampi/Heaper/requirements/?branch=master\r\n   :alt: Requirements Status\r\n.. |waffle| image:: https://img.shields.io/waffle/label/MrTimscampi/Heaper/in%20progress.svg?maxAge=2592000\r\n   :target: http://waffle.io/MrTimscampi/Heaper\r\n   :alt: Stories in progress",
