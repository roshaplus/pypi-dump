    "description": "fauxident is a small Python script that will act as an extremely\r\n    naive ident server, answering all ident requests with a consistent\r\n    response -- either an ERROR or a USERID response.  This can be\r\n    advantageous on systems where running a true identd is\r\n    unavailable, where it would be a security risk, or when\r\n    masquerading firewalls are in use, where multiple machines are\r\n    involved behind the firewall and running a proper ident system is\r\n    not an option.",
