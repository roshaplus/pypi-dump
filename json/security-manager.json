    "description": "# Security Manager\nThe Security Manager inside the SoftFIRE Middleware makes available to the Experimenter a \nseries of security related functionalities that she might decide to include and use within her \nactivities on the SoftFIRE platform. \nHere is the list of the available features.\n\n1. The Experimenter can deploy a Security Resource \n2. The Experimenter can statically configure her Security Resource by means of its descriptor \n   1. The Experimenter can enable logs collection from her Resource \n   1. The Experimenter can statically configure some rules on her Resource \n3. The Experimenter can dynamically configure her Resource once it has been deployed \n4. The Experimenter can see her Resources logs in a web dashboard \n5. The Experimenter can perform searches among her Resources logs in a web dashboard \n6. The Experimenter can see statistics related to her Resources logs in a web dashboard  \n\n## Security Resources \nA Security Resource is a commonly used security agent that the Experimenter can include in her \nexperiment. She can access and configure it through a static initial configuration, included in the \nTOSCA description of the Resource, or, once deployed, through a REST interface that exposes its \nmain services. \nThe Experimenter can also ask the Security Resource to send its log messages to a remote log \ncollector, which makes them available in a simple web page reserved to her. The Experimenter \ncould easily access it through its web browser and check the behaviour of her all security agents, \nand to see some statistics. \nThe Experimenter can get the Security Resource in two different formats: \n\n* As an agent directly installed in the VM that she wants to monitor. The system will \nprovide her a script that the Experimenter has just to run inside the VM. It will be already \nconfigured as required in the TOSCA description of the resource. The output of the script \nwill provide to the Experimenter information on how to access the deployed resource \n(URLs, etc.) \n\n* As a standalone VM the Security Resource will be deployed directly by the Security \nManager in the testbed chosen by the Experimenter. The Security Manager will take \ncare of the initial configuration of the resource. \nThe Experimenter has to set up on her own the redirection of the network traffic that she wants \nto control through the Security Resource VM (by means of tunnelling or SDN capabilities).  \n\n\nTo date the only Security Resource available on the SoftFIRE environment is the [firewall][firewall].  \n\n\n## Security Resource definition\n\n```yaml\nSecurityResource:\n    derived_from: eu.softfire.BaseResource\n    description: Defines a Security agent to be deployed. More details on [docu_url]\n    properties:\n        resource_id:\n            type: string\n            required: true\n        testbed:\n            type: string\n            required: false\n        want_agent:\n            type: boolean\n            required: true\n        logging:\n            type: boolean\n            required: true\n        allowed_ips:\n            type: list\n            entry_schema:\n                type: string\n            required: false\n        denied_ips:\n            type: list\n            entry_schema:\n                type: string\n            required: false\n        default_rule:\n            type: string\n            required: true\n```\n \nThis node type has different properties:\n\n* **resource_id**: Defines the type of the Security Resource. To date only [firewall][firewall] is accepted\n* **testbed**: Defines where to deploy the Security Resource selected. It is ignored if want_agent is True\n* **want_agent**: Defines if the Experimenter wants the security resource to be an agent directly installed on the VM that she wants to monitor\n* **logging**: Defines if the Experimenter wants the security resource to send its log messages to a collector and she wants to see them on a dashboard\n* **allowed_ips**: List of IPs (or CIDR  masks) allowed by the firewall. [allow from *IP*]\n* **denied_ips**: List of IPs (or CIDR masks) denied by the firewall [deny from *IP*]\n* **default_rule**: Default rule applied by the firewall (allow/deny)\n\n\n##### Testbed Names\n\n| Alias    | Testbed                          |\n|----------|----------------------------------|\n| fokus    | FOKUS testbed, Berlin            |\n| ericsson | ERICSSON testbed, Rome           |\n| surrey   | SURREY testbed, Surrey           |\n| ads      | ADS testbed, Rome                |\n| dt       | Deutsche Telekom testbed, Berlin |\n| any      | No difference                    |\n\n## Technical details\nThis sequence diagram specifies the operations performed by the Security Manager based on the inputs received by the Experimenter.\n![Security Manager sequence diagram][sequence]\n\n\n\n<!--\n References\n-->\n \n[node_types]:etc/softfire_node_types.yaml\n[firewall]:firewall.md\n[docu_url]:http://docs.softfire.eu/security-manager/\n[sequence]: sec_manager.png\n",
