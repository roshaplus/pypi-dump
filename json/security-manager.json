    "description": "# Security Manager\nThe Security Manager inside the SoftFIRE Middleware makes available to the Experimenters a\nset of security related functionalities that they might decide to include and use within their\nactivities on the SoftFIRE platform.\n\nHere is the list of the available features for every type of Resource.\n\n1. The Experimenters can deploy a Security Resource\n2. The Experimenters can statically configure the Security Resource by means of its descriptor\n1. The Experimenter can statically configure some features on her Resource\n3. The Experimenters can dynamically configure the Resource once it has been deployed\n\nFeatures **not** available for Resource _pfsense_\n\n1. The Experimenters can enable logs collection from their Resource\n4. The Experimenters can see Resources logs in a web dashboard\n5. The Experimenters can perform searches among the Resources logs in a web dashboard\n6. The Experimenters can see statistics related to the Resources logs in a web dashboard  \n\n## Security Resources\nA Security Resource is a commonly used security agent that the Experimenters can include in their\nexperiment. They can access and configure it through a static initial configuration, included in the\nTOSCA description of the Experiment, or, once deployed, through the interfaces that expose its\nmain services. These interfaces can include SSH, a dashboard, or ReST APIs.\nDepending on the type of Resource, Experimenters can also ask the Security Resource to send its log messages to a remote log\ncollector, which makes them available in a simple web page reserved to them. The Experimenters\ncould easily access it through its web browser and check the behaviour of all their security agents,\nand to see some related statistics.\n\nThe Experimenters can get the Security Resource in two different formats:\n\n* As an agent directly installed in the VM that they want to monitor. The system will\nprovide them a script that the Experimenters have just to run inside the VM. It will be already\nconfigured as required in the TOSCA description of the resource. The output of the script\nwill provide to the Experimenters information on how to access the deployed resource\n(URLs, etc.)\n\n* As a standalone VM. The Security Resource will be deployed directly by the Security\nManager in the testbed chosen by the Experimenter. The Security Manager will take\ncare of the initial configuration of the resource.\nThe Experimenters have to set up on their own the redirection of the network traffic that they want\nto control through the Security Resource VM (by means of OS configuration, or SDN capabilities provided by the SoftFIRE platform).  \n\nThe Security Manager provides three types of resources:\n\n* [firewall][firewall]\n* [suricata][suricata]\n* [pfsense][pfsense]\n\n\n## Security Resource definition\nIn this section the attributes that can be defined for a TOSCA node of type _SecurityResource_ are listed. Please note that\nthe meaning of the specific property depends on the type of resource (specified in the *resource_id* field). \nFor more details, refer to the specific sections of the documentation. \n\n```yaml\nSecurityResource:\n    derived_from: eu.softfire.BaseResource\n    description: \"Defines a Security agent to be deployed. More details on [docu_url]\"\n    properties:\n\n        resource_id:\n            type: string\n            required: true\n\n        testbed:\n            type: string\n            required: false\n\n        lan_name:\n            type: string\n            required: false\n\n        wan_name: \n            type: string\n            required: false\n            description: valid for pfsense\n\n        ssh_key:\n            type: string\n            required: false\n            description: valid for firewall and suricata\n\n        want_agent:\n            type: boolean\n            required: false\n            description: valid for firewall and suricata\n\n        logging:\n            type: boolean\n            required: false\n            description: valid for firewall and suricata\n\n        allowed_ips:\n            type: list\n            entry_schema:\n                type: string\n            required: false\n            description: valid for firewall\n\n        denied_ips:\n            type: list\n            entry_schema:\n                type: string\n            required: false\n            description: valid for firewall\n\n        default_rule:\n            type: string\n            required: false\n            description: valid for firewall\n\n        rules: \n            type: list\n            entry_schema:\n                type: string \n            required: false\n            description: valid for suricata\n```\n\nEvery node has different properties. Here they are listed for each type of resource:\n\n**resource_id = [firewall][firewall]**\n\n* **testbed**: Defines where to deploy the Security Resource selected. It is ignored if want_agent is True\n* **want_agent**: Defines if the Experimenter wants the security resource to be an agent directly installed on the VM that he wants to monitor\n* **ssh_key**: Defines the SSH public key to be pushed on the VM in order to be able to log into it\n* **lan_name**: Select the network on which the VM is deployed (if __want_agent__ is False). If no value is entered, __softfire-internal__ is chosen\n* **logging**: Defines if the Experimenter wants the security resource to send its log messages to a collector and he wants to see them on a dashboard\n* **allowed_ips**: List of IPs (or CIDR  masks) allowed by the firewall. [allow from *IP*]\n* **denied_ips**: List of IPs (or CIDR masks) denied by the firewall [deny from *IP*]\n* **default_rule**: Default rule applied by the firewall (allow/deny)\n\n**resource_id = [suricata][suricata]**\n\n* **testbed**: Defines where to deploy the Security Resource selected. It is ignored if want_agent is True\n* **want_agent**: Defines if the Experimenter wants the security resource to be an agent directly installed on the VM that he wants to monitor\n* **ssh_key**: Defines the SSH public key to be pushed on the VM in order to be able to log into it\n* **lan_name**: Select the network on which the VM is deployed (if __want_agent__ is False). If no value is entered, __softfire-internal__ is chosen\n* **logging**: Defines if the Experimenter wants the security resource to send its log messages to a collector and he wants to see them on a dashboard\n* **rules**: Defines the list of rules to be configured in Suricata VM. These rules follow the syntax \n\n**resource_id = [pfsense][pfsense]**\n\n* **testbed**: Defines where to deploy the Security Resource selected\n* **wan_name**: Selects the network on which the first interface of the VM is attached. It is configured as WAN on pfSense. It must be a network connected to the SoftFIRE-public network \n* **lan_name**: Selects the network on which the second interface of the VM is attached. It is configured as LAN on pfSense\n\n\n##### Testbed Names\n\n| Alias    | Testbed                          |\n|----------|----------------------------------|\n| fokus    | FOKUS testbed, Berlin            |\n| ericsson | ERICSSON testbed, Rome           |\n| surrey   | SURREY testbed, Surrey           |\n| ads      | ADS testbed, Rome                |\n\n## Technical details\nThis sequence diagram specifies the operations performed by the Security Manager based on the inputs received by the Experimenter.\n![Security Manager sequence diagram][sequence]\n\n\n\n<!--\n References\n-->\n\n[node_types]:etc/softfire_node_types.yaml\n[firewall]:firewall.md\n[suricata]:suricata.md\n[pfsense]:pfsense.md\n[docu_url]:http://docs.softfire.eu/security-manager/\n[sequence]:security-manager.png\n\n\n\n\n\n",
