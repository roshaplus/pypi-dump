    "description": "###############\nWhat's Filehub?\n###############\n\nWhat do you do if you want to quickly share a file in your local network? You\nmay want to:\n\n1. Set up a file server, such as an FTP server, or\n\n2. Install point-to-point file transfer software, such as IP Messenger,\n   on all the machines you want to share files.\n\nThe first way needs you to wait for the shared file to be completely\nuploaded before you can start downloading, if the file was not on the file\nserver already. And it also needs vast caching space on the file server.\n\nThe second way needs you to install the software on all the machines. It's\ncumbersome indeed. And what if there's an incompatible platform that you\ncannot install the software on?\n\nFilehub solves all these problems. If you want to share a file quickly,\nFilehub is the choice.\n\nFilehub is actually an HTTP server that accepts file uploading via POST\nmethods. But it's different from a regular file server in that it relays the\nuploaded data **directly** to the downloader. This means that you don't need\nto wait for the upload to be completed before downloading.\n\n#####\nUsage\n#####\n\nInstall Filehub:\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n\n    pip install filehub\n\nStart it on your local server:\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n\n    filehub\n\nFilehub listens on <all interfaces>:8000 by default. Now you can use any HTTP\nclient to access Filehub's interface. For example, uploading a file using\ncurl:\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n\n    curl --form f=@FILENAME http://ip.addr.for.filehub:8000/hub\n\nOr you can also use Filehub's bundled HTML5 client at\nhttp://ip.addr.for.filehub:8000 . It has a nicer look, and supports\ndrag & drop operations.\n\nThe files being uploaded will be shown in the bottom part of the HTML5 page.\nSimply clicking the file name will start downloading.\n\n##########\nAdvantages\n##########\n\n1. HTTP protocol is quite popular. Most machines and smart devices already\n   have a client installed, you don't need other stuff.\n\n2. Filehub does not cache any data at all, so it can be run on devices with\n   limited resources, such as a Raspberry Pi or an NAS box, as long as you\n   have Python installed on them.\n\n3. Filehub streams the shared files on-the-fly, so you don't need to wait for\n   the files to be uploaded first. This makes it  extremely suitable for\n   one-shot sharing of large files.\n\n#######\nLicense\n#######\n\nFilehub is licensed under the terms of the MIT license. See LICENSE.txt.",
