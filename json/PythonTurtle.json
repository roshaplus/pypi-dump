    "description": "PythonTurtle strives to provide the lowest-threshold way to learn (or teach) \r\nPython. Students command an interactive Python shell (similar to the IDLE \r\ndevelopment environment) and use Python functions to move a turtle displayed on \r\nthe screen. An illustrated help screen introduces the student to the basics of \r\nPython programming while demonstrating how to move the turtle.\r\n\r\nPythonTurtle was created by Ram Rachum as a side-project in 2009. I also provide `freelance Django/Python development services <https://chipmunkdev.com>`_.",
