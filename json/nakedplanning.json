    "description": "This tool is designed to ease planning and management\nof Agile projects. It can help reduce some of the drudgery, but most\nimportantly it can help you learn a leaner, more efficient way to think about\nyour work.\n\nTo join in the developoment of this application, download and run\nhttp://svn.arlim.org/code_sprint/planningtool/devel.py. This will set up a\nvirtual environment containing only what you need for the Naked Planning\ntool - and leaving your base Python install unaltered.\n\nAlternatively, you can access the source directly at\nhttp://svn.arlim.org/code_sprint/planningtool/trunk/#egg=nakedplanning-dev\n\nThis tool is far from ready for use. However, I'm trying to get it up here\nto ease distribution and IT hassles for developers. Only the -dev egg is worth\nanything at the moment (it pulls directly from our svn repository).\n\nRUN THE NON-DEV EGGS AT YOUR OWN RISK.",
