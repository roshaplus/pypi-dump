    "description": "# Includes for Foliant\n\nIncludes preprocessor lets you reuse parts of other documents in your Foliant project sources. It can include from files on your local machine and remote Git repositories. You can include entire documents as well as parts between particular headings, removing or normalizing included headings on the way.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```shell\n$ pip install foliantcontrib.includes\n```\n\n\n## Config\n\nTo enable the preprocessor with default options, add `includes` to `preprocessors` section in the project config:\n\n```yaml\npreprocessors:\n  - includes\n```\n\nThe preprocessor has a number of options:\n\n```yaml\npreprocessors:\n  - includes:\n      cache_dir: !path .includescache\n      recursive: true\n      aliases:\n        ...\n```\n\n`cache_dir`\n:   Path to the directory for cloned repositories. It can be a path relative to the project path or a global one; you can use `~/` shortcut.\n\n    >   **Note**\n    >\n    >    To include files from remote repositories, the preprocessor clones them. To save time during build, cloned repositories are stored and reused in future builds.\n\n`recursive`\n:   Flag that defines whether includes in included documents should be processed.\n\n`aliases`\n:   Mapping from aliases to Git repository URLs. Once defined here, an alias can be used to refer to the repository instead of its full URL.\n\n    For example, if you set this alias in the config:\n\n        - includes:\n          aliases:\n            foo: https://github.com/boo/bar.git\n\n    you can include README.md file content from this repository using this syntax:\n\n        <<include>$foo$path/to/doc.md</include>\n\n\n## Usage\n\nTo include a document from your machine, put the path to it between `<<include>...</include>` tags:\n\n```markdown\nText below is taken from another document.\n\n<<include>/path/to/another/document.md</include>\n```\n\nTo include a document from a remote Git repository, put its URL between `$`s in front of the document path:\n\n```markdown\nText below is taken from a remote repository.\n\n<<include>\n    $https://github.com/foo/bar.git$path/to/doc.md\n</include>\n```\n\nIf the repository alias is defined in the project config, you can use it instead of the URL:\n\n```yaml\n- includes:\n    aliases:\n      foo: https://github.com/foo/bar.git\n```\n\nAnd then in the source:\n\n```markdown\n<<include>$foo$path/to/doc.md</include>\n```\n\nYou can also specify a particular branch or revision:\n\n```markdown\nText below is taken from a remote repository on branch develop.\n\n<<include>$foo#develop$path/to/doc.md</include>\n```\n\nTo include a part of a document between two headings, use the `#Start:Finish` syntax after the file path:\n\n```markdown\nInclude content from \"Intro\" up to \"Credits\":\n\n<<include>sample.md#Intro:Credits</include>\n\nInclude content from start up to \"Credits\":\n\n<<include>sample.md#:Credits</include>\n\nInclude content from \"Intro\" up to the next heading of the same level:\n\n<<include>sample.md#Intro</include>\n```\n\n\n### Options\n\n`sethead`\n:   The level of the topmost heading in the included content. Use it to guarantee that the included text doesn't break the parent document's heading order:\n\n        # Title\n\n        ## Subtitle\n\n        <<include sethead=\"3\">\n            other.md\n        </include>\n\n`nohead`\n:   Flag that tells the preprocessor to strip the starting heading from the included content:\n\n        # My Custom Heading\n\n        <<include nohead=\"true\">\n            other.md#Original Heading\n        </include>\n\n    Default is `false`.\n\nOptions can be combined. For example, use both `sethead` and `nohead` if you want to include a section with a custom heading:\n\n```markdown\n# My Custom Heading\n\n<<include sethead=\"1\" nohead=\"true\">\n  other.md#Original Heading\n</include>\n```\n",
