    "description": "This module makes it much cleaner and easier to use named pipes under Windows. It does not offer a feature rich API, but I may add more methods to support various other features such as setting the security of the pipe and support byte mode. At the moment only message mode is supported.\r\n\r\nSee the github page for examples!",
