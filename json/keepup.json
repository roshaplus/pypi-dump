    "description": "**********************************\nkeepup\n**********************************\n\nkeepup is a command line process manager, similar to `Foreman <https://github.com/ddollar/foreman>`_ and `Honcho <https://github.com/nickstenning/honcho>`_, except it uses `npyscreen <https://code.google.com/p/npyscreen/>`_ to provide a curses interface for monitoring stdout, stderr, and for sending input to stdin.\n\nkeepup uses an ``Upfile`` similar to a ``Procfile``. An example is shown below\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  # Upfiles support comments by prefixing a line with the # character\n  mytask: python myscript.py\n  # The following line will set the working directory for the specified task\n  @mytask: /home/user/directory\n\nSupport for advanced features is limited.",
