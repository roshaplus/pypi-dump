    "description": "Background of the Free Law Reporters Database\n=============================================\n\nA long, long time ago near a courthouse not too far away, people started\nkeeping books of every important opinion that was ever written. These\nbooks became known as *reporters* and were generally created by\nlibrarian-types of yore such as `Mr. William\nCranch <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cranch>`__ and `Alex\nDallas <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_J._Dallas_%28statesman%29>`__.\n\nThese people were busy for the next few centuries and created\n*thousands* of these books, culminating in what we know today as West's\nreporters or as regional reporters like the \"Dakota Reports\" or the\nthoroughly-named, \"Synopses of the Decisions of the Supreme Court of\nTexas Arising from Restraints by Conscript and Other Military\nAuthorities (Robards).\"\n\nIn this repository we've taken a look at all these reporters and tried\nto sort out what we know about them and convert that to data. This data\nis available as a JSON file, and can be browsed in an unofficial CSV.\n\nNaturally, converting several centuries' history into clean data results\nin a mess, but we've done our best and this mess is in use in a number\nof projects as listed below.\n\nWe hope you'll find this useful to your endeavors and that you'll share\nyour work with the community if you improve or use this work.\n\nCSV\n===\n\nYou can make a CSV of this data by running:\n\n::\n\n    make_csv.py\n\nWe keep a copy of this CSV in this repository (``reporters.csv``), but\nit is not kept up to date. It should, however, provide a good idea of\nwhat's here.\n\nKnown Implementations\n=====================\n\n1. This work was originally deployed in the\n   `CourtListener <https://www.courtlistener.com>`__ citation finder\n   beginning in about 2012. It has been used literally millions of times\n   to identify citations between cases.\n\n2. An extension for Firefox known as the `Free Law\n   Ferret <http://citationstylist.org/2013/08/20/free-law-ferret-document-to-cited-cases-in-a-click/>`__\n   uses this code to find citations in your browser as you read things\n   -- all over the Web.\n\n3. A Node module called\n   `Walverine <https://github.com/adelevie/walverine>`__ uses an\n   iteration of this code to find citations using the V8 JavaScript\n   engine.\n\nSome Notes on the Data\n======================\n\nSome things to bear in mind as you are examining the Free Law Reporters\nDatabase:\n\n1. Each Reporter key maps to a list of reporters that that key can\n   represent. In some cases (especially in early reporters), the key is\n   ambiguous, referring to more than one possible reporter.\n2. Formats follow the Blue Book standard, with variations listed for\n   local rules and other ways lawyers abbreviate it over the years or\n   accidentally.\n3. The ``variations`` key consists of data from local rules, found\n   through organic usage in our corpus and from the `Cardiff Index to\n   Legal Abbreviations <http://www.legalabbrevs.cardiff.ac.uk/>`__. We\n   have used a dict for these values due to the fact that there can be\n   variations for each series.\n4. ``mlz_jurisdiction`` corresponds to the work that is being done for\n   Multi-Lingual Zotero. This field is maintained by Frank Bennett and\n   may sometimes be missing values.\n5. Some reporters have ``href`` or ``notes`` fields to provide a link to\n   the best available reference (often Wikipedia) or to provide notes\n   about the reporter itself.\n6. Regarding dates of the editions, there are a few things to know. In\n   reporters with multiple series, if multiple volumes have the same\n   dates, this indicates that the point where one series ends and the\n   other begins is unknown. If an edition has 1750 as its start date,\n   this indicates that the actual start date is unknown. Likewise, if an\n   edition has ``null`` as its end date, that indicates the actual end\n   date is either unknown, or it's known that the series has not\n   completed. These areas need research before we can release version\n   1.1 of this database. Finally, dates are inclusive, so the first and\n   last opinions in a reporter series have the same dates as the\n   database.\n\nA complete data point has fields like so:\n\n::\n\n    \"$citation\": [\n        {\n            \"cite_type\": \"state|federal|neutral|specialty|specialty_west|specialty_lexis|state_regional|scotus_early\",\n            \"editions\": {\n                \"$citation\": {\n                    \"end\": null,\n                    \"start\": \"1750-01-01T00:00:00\"\n                },\n                \"$citation 2d\": {\n                    \"end\": null,\n                    \"start\": \"1750-01-01T00:00:00\"\n                }\n            },\n            \"mlz_jurisdiction\": [],\n            \"name\": \"\",\n            \"variations\": {},\n            \"notes\": \"\",\n            \"href\": \"\",\n            \"publisher\": \"\"\n        }\n    ],\n\nSome notes on the ``state_abbreviations`` and\n``case_name_abbreviations`` files:\n\n1. Abbreviations are based on data from the values in the nineteenth\n   edition of the Blue Book supplemented with abbreviations found in our\n   corpus.\n2. ``case_name_abbreviations.json`` contains the abbreviations that are\n   likely to occur in the case name of an opinion.\n3. ``state_abbreviations.json`` contains the abbreviations that are\n   likely to be used to refer to American states.\n\nNotes on Specific Data Point and References\n-------------------------------------------\n\n1. Mississippi supports neutral citations, but does so in their own\n   format, as specified in `this\n   rule <http://www.aallnet.org/main-menu/Advocacy/access/citation/neutralrules/rules-ms.html>`__.\n   Research is needed for the format in ``reporters.json`` to see if it\n   is used accidentally as a variant of their rule or whether it is an\n   error in this database.\n2. New Mexico dates confirmed via the `table\n   here <http://www.nmcompcomm.us/nmcases/pdf/NM%20Reports%20to%20Official%20-%20Vols.%201-75.pdf>`__.\n3. Both Puerto Rico and \"Pennsylvania State Reports, Penrose and Watts\"\n   use the citation \"P.R.\"\n\nInstallation (Python)\n=====================\n\nYou can install the Free Law Reporters Database with a few simple\ncommands:\n\n::\n\n    pip install reporters-db\n\nOnce installed you can use it in your code with something like:\n\n::\n\n    from reporters_db import REPORTERS\n\nYou can see all of the variables that can be imported by looking in\n``__init__.py``. Other variables currently include:\n``STATE_ABBREVIATIONS``, ``CASE_NAME_ABBREVIATIONS``,\n``VARIATIONS_ONLY``, and ``EDITIONS``. These latter two are convenience\nvariables that you can use to get different views of the ``REPORTERS``\ndata.\n\nOf course, if you're not using Python, the data is in the ``json``\nformat, so you should be able to import it using your language of\nchoice.\n\nTests\n=====\n\n|Build Status|\n\nWe have a few tests that make sure things haven't completely broken.\nThey are automatically run by Travis CI each time a push is completed\nand should be run by developers as well before pushing. They can be run\nwith:\n\n::\n\n    python tests.py\n\nIt's pretty simple, right?\n\nVersion History\n===============\n\nPast Versions\n-------------\n\n-  1.0: Has all common Blue Book reporters, with their variations from\n   the Cardiff database.\n-  1.0.1\n\n   1. Bug fix after application to Lawbox bulk data\n   2. Updates cite\\_type for better granularity and to eliminate a few\n      errors.\n   3. Adds WL, LEXIS and U.S. App. LEXIS as specialty\\_lexis and\n      specialty\\_west cite\\_types.\n   4. ``fed`` cite\\_type has been converted to ``federal``\n\n-  1.0.2\n\n   1. Adds tests to verify the data (see ./tests.py)\n   2. Fixes a few data issues after applying tests\n\nCurrent Version\n---------------\n\n-  1.0.9: Updates the mlz\\_jurisdiction field to be state-specific, per\n   issue #1.\n\nFuture Versions\n---------------\n\n-  1.1: All dates are dialed in to the nearest year for every edition of\n   every reporter (some still require research beyond what Blue Book\n   provides). See `issue\n   #7 <https://github.com/freelawproject/reporters-db/issues/7>`__\n-  1.2: All dates are dialed into the correct day for every edition of\n   every reporter.\n-  1.x: International Reporters added?\n-  2.0: Other features (suggestions welcome)?\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nThis repository is available under the permissive BSD license, making it\neasy and safe to incorporate in your own libraries.\n\nPull and feature requests welcome. Online editing in Github is possible\n(and easy!)\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/freelawproject/reporters-db.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/freelawproject/reporters-db",
