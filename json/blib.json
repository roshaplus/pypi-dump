    "description": "BL is a python3 framework to use if you want to program CLI, IRC or XMPP bots.\n\nfeatures\n========\n\nBL provides the following features:\n\n::\n\n object class\t \tsave/load to/from a json file.\n rest server \t\tserve saved object\u2019s over http.\n rss fetcher \t\techo rss feeds to irc channels.\n udp server \t\tudp to bot to irc channel.\n watcher server \trun tail -f and have output send to IRC channel.\n email scanning \tscan mbox format to searchable bl objects.\n json backend \t\tobjects are stored as json string in files on the fs.\n db\t\t\titeration over stored objects.\n timestamp\t\ttime based filenames gives logging capabilities\n future\t\t\tfuture sensors should provide entry to the logger.\n\ninstall\n=======\n\nClone the source:\n\n:: \n\n bart@okdan:~$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/thatebart/bl\n\n You might need to do one of the following if the bot doesn't work:\n\n bart@okdan:~/bl$ export PYTHONPATH=\".\"\n bart@okdan:~/bl$ export PYTHONIOENCODING=\"utf-8\"\n\nAnother option is to download with pip3 and install globally:\n\n::\n\n bart@okdan:~$ pip3 install bl --upgrade\n\nirc\n===\n\nUse -n <nick>, -s <server>, -c <channel> options to make the bot join the network:\n\n::\n\n bart@okdan:~$ bot -i irc -n bl -s irc.freenode.net -c \\#bl\n\nYou can use the -w option to write config values to ~/.bot/config/irc\n\nxmpp\n====\n\nFor the xmpp bot use the -i xmpp and --room arguments:\n\n::\n\n bart@okdan:~$ bot -i xmpp --room=test@conference.localhost\n\nusers\n=====\n\nOne needs to add a users origin to be able to give the bot commands. One can add a user with the meet command:\n\n::\n\n bart@okdan:~$ bot meet user@server\n user user@server created\n\nTo give the user a permission you can use the perm command:\n\n::\n\n bart@okdan:~$ bot perm user@server ps\n ok user@server\n\nThe u command show the json dump of a user object:\n\n::\n\n bart@okdan:~$ bot u user@server \n {\n     \"_container\": {\n         \"default\": \"\",\n         \"path\": \"/home/bart/.bot/user/2017-10-12/21:05:52.095737\",\n         \"prefix\": \"object\",\n         \"saved\": \"Thu Oct 12 21:07:03 2017\",\n         \"signature\": \"c113c4125f8c2a88d5b312e283792ae019c61a52\"\n     },\n     \"_type\": \"<class 'bl.object.Object'>\",\n     \"origin\": \"user@server\",\n     \"perms\": [\n         \"USER\",\n         \"PS\"\n     ],\n     \"user\": \"user@server\"\n }\n\nThe default shell user is root@shell and gives access to all the commands that are available.\n\ncommands\n========\n\nThe following commands are

kwargs).\n\nprogramming\n===========\n\nBL makes it possible to program your own module enabling your own commands.\n\ncode example:\n\n::\n\n     def hi(event):\n         event.reply(\"hi %s\" % event.origin)\n\n\nuser programmed modules are read from a botmods directory in your current\nworking directory, you can put your .py files over there.\n\nlicense\n=======\n\nBL has a MIT
