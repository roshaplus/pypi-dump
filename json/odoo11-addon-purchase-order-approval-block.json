Upon confirmation of an RFQ the orders will be\nwaiting for approval by a Manager.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\n* Go to \u2018Purchases / Configuration / Purchase Approval Block Reasons\u2019 and create\n  the blocking reasons as needed, providing a name and a description. A field\n  \u2018Active\u2019 allows you to deactivate the reason if you do not plan to use it\n  any more.\n* Assign the security group 'Release blocked RFQ' to users that should be able\n  to release the block. Users in group 'Purchase / Managers' are by default\n  assigned to this group.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nSet the Purchase Approval Block\n-------------------------------\n\n#. Go to \u2018Purchases / Purchase / Requests for Quotation\u2019\n#. Create a new RFQ and indicate the approval block reason (found in the\n   right hand side of the screen, below the order date).\n\nSearch existing RFQ\n-------------------\n\nThere is a filter \u2018Blocked\u2019 to search for orders that are blocked for approval.\nIt is also possible to search RFQ\u2019s with a specific block reason.\n\nConfirm the RFQ\n---------------\n\n#. Press the button \u2018Confirm\u2019. If there\u2019s an approval block, the order will\n   be set to status 'To Approve'. You will then need to request a Purchase\n   Manager to approve it.\n\nRelease the purchase approval block\n-----------------------------------\n\nWhile the RFQ is in draft, members of security group \u2018Release blocked RFQ\u2019,\ncan see a button \u2018Release Approval Block\u2019. From this point and on, anyone\nseeing that RFQ will be able to validate it.\n\nNotifications to followers\n--------------------------\n\nFollowers of the RFQ receive notifications when an approval block has been\nset or released.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/142/11.0\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/purchase-workflow/issues>`_.
