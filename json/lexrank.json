To define your own mapping of stop words, prepare text files with utf-8 encoding where words are separated by newlines. Then use the command\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    assemble_stopwords --source_dir directory_with_txt_files\n\nthat replaces the default mapping. Note that names of .txt files are used as keys in `STOPWORDS` dictionary.\n\nTests\n-----\n\nTests are not supplied with the package, to run them you need to clone the repository and install additional dependencies.\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    # ensure virtualenv is activated\n    make install-dev\n\nRun linter and tests\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    make lint\n    make test\n\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nG\u00fcne\u015f Erkan and Dragomir R.
