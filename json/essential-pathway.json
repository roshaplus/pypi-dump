    "description": "Essential-pathway Documentation v1.0\n====================================\n**Quick Links**\n---------------\n- `Project <https://github.com/realasking/essential-pathway>`\n- `Author's Homepage <https://realasking.wordpress.com>`\n- `Author's Emails <realasking@gmail.com,tomwangsim@163.com>`\n- `Manual of Environment Modules <http://modules.sourceforge.net/tcl/module.html>`\n\nIntroduction\n------------\nEssential-pathway (short for ep) is a tool that helps people quickly access to their most commonly used folders in command line in some \noperation systems like linux. A PATHWAY is an environment variable defined by users using this tool, which consists of a pathway name, a path and a comment. \nOne can add, modify or delete their definations of PATHWAYS to their folders' paths, or do some comments to prevent forgetting.\n\nThis tool have only been tested in archlinux and might not be able to use under root. It's based on Environment Modules (short for em) and is released under LGPLv3.\n\nDependencies\n------------\nThe native Tcl version Environment Modules package is needed by this tool, while a $HOME/.modulespath with a contained user modulefiles folder \nshould also be created by user before using ep. \n\nAn example of $HOME/.modulespath:<br>\n```bash\nmodules\n```\n\nAnd a folder name modules should be created in $HOME/\n\nAfter that, the following sentences must be add to $HOME/.bashrc to keep em works properly:<br>\n```bash\nexport MODULEPATH=${HOME}/modules:$MODULEPATH <br>\nsource /etc/modules-tcl/init/bash<br>\n```\nPrettytable, an elegant table processing python library is also needed.\n\nEp can be installed when all dependencies are met.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n```bash \ngit clone https://github.com/realasking/essential-pathway.git \ncd essential-pathway \nsudo python ./setup.py install \n```\nOr you can use pip \n```bash \npip install essential-pathway \n```\n\nUsage\n-----\nNotice:<br>\nBefore each operations below, please execute \\'module unload epath\\' first.<br>\nTo make pathways usable, please execute \\'module load epath\\' or add this sentence to $HOME/.bashrc.<br>\n\\'ep u\\' just delete epath, and will keep the database file in $HOME/.ep.\n\nQuckly add current foler to a pathway<br>\n```bash \nep a PATHWAY_NAME\n```\nListing exsit pathways<br>\n```bash \nep l\n```\nCreate a pathway<br>\n```bash\nep a PATHWAY_NAME PATH_TO_YOUR_FOLDER\n```\nMake or change a short comment for an exists pathway<br>\n```bash \nep c PATHWAY_NAME \n```\nModify a pathway<br>\n```bash \nep m PATHWAY_NAME PATH_TO_NEW_FOLDER\n```\nDelete a pathway<br>\n```bash \nep d PATHWAY_NAME \n```\nCheck paths' availabilities and automatic delete invalid ones<br>\n```bash \nep k\n```\nRefresh the Env-module<br>\n```bash \nep r\n```\nBackup settings<br>\n```bash \nep b \n``` \nUninstall all settings<br>\n```bash \nep u \n```\n\nrealasking\nAug 15,2017\nchanglog\n--------\n2017-07-23 Begins to arrange older scripts I wrote to manage massive folders' paths\n2017-08-06 All scripts have been rewritten by using python3\n2017-08-15 Finished debuging and testing in 64bit linux, and publish version 1.0 \n",
