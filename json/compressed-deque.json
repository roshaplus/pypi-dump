The middle pickle layer only serves as a generic serialization method which can provide a serialized object string for zlib to compress. Although pickle can compress objects, its compression rate does not match zlib's, even using `higher protocols <https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html#data-stream-format>`_.\n        \n        .. image:: docs/images/value_layers.png\n        \n        ``save_to_file()`` and ``load_from_file()`` static methods are provided to persist the collection directly into disk in its compressed representation, without much overhead.\n        \n        The persisted file contains a sequence of header/compressed_value pairs: the header is a 4 byte integer description of the compressed value's length and the compressed value is similiar to its in-memory representation.\n        \n        .. image:: docs/images/persisted_values.png\nKeywords: compressed deque zipped zlib\nPlatform: UNKNOWN\nClassifier: Development Status :: 3 - Alpha\nClassifier: Intended Audience :: Developers\nClassifier: Topic :: Software Development :: Build Tools\nClassifier: License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License\nClassifier: Programming Language :: Python :: 2\nClassifier: Programming Language :: Python :: 2.6\nClassifier: Programming Language :: Python :: 2.7",
