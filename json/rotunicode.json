    "description": "rotunicode\n==========\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/box/rotunicode.png?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/box/rotunicode\n\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/box/rotunicode/badge.png\n    :target: https://coveralls.io/r/box/rotunicode\n\n.. image:: https://pypip.in/v/rotunicode/badge.png\n    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rotunicode\n\n.. image:: https://pypip.in/d/rotunicode/badge.png\n    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rotunicode\n\n\nRotUnicode is a Python library that can convert a string containing ASCII\ncharacters to a string with non-ASCII characters without losing readability.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> 'Hello World!'.encode('rotunicode')\n    \u0124\u0205\u013e\u013e\u0151 \u0174\u0151\u0155\u013e\u010f!\n    >>> '\u0124\u0205\u013e\u013e\u0151 \u0174\u0151\u0155\u013e\u010f!'.decode('rotunicode')\n    Hello World!\n\nIn the above example, the 'Hello World' string has all ASCII characters.\nEncoding it with RotUnicode gives you '\u0124\u0205\u013e\u013e\u0151 \u0174\u0151\u0155\u013e\u010f' which reads like\n'Hello World' but has all non-ASCII characters.\n\n\nWhy is this named RotUnicode?\n-----------------------------\n\nRotUnicode stands for rotate-to-unicode. Or rotten-unicode for those who have\nnightmares about Unicode. It was inspired by Rot13.\n\n\nSupported Characters\n--------------------\n\nRotUnicode converts lower case and upper case characters of the English\nalphabet and digits 0 to 9 to non-ASCII characters. All characters that are\noutside this range are left as is.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> '\u0939\u0947\u0932\u094b World!'.encode('rotunicode')\n    \u0939\u0947\u0932\u094b \u0174\u0151\u0155\u013e\u010f!\n    >>> '\u0939\u0947\u0932\u094b \u0174\u0151\u0155\u013e\u010f!'.decode('rotunicode')\n    \u0939\u0947\u0932\u094b World!\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install, simply:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    pip install rotunicode\n\n\nUse\n---\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> from rotunicode import ruencode\n    >>> ruencode('Hello World!')\n    \u0124\u0205\u013e\u013e\u0151 \u0174\u0151\u0155\u013e\u010f!\n    >>> rudecode('\u0124\u0205\u013e\u013e\u0151 \u0174\u0151\u0155\u013e\u010f!')\n    Hello World!\n\n\nAs a Codec\n----------\n\nIn Python 2, RotUnicode can also be used as a codec, but it must first\nbe registered with the codecs library. This allows python to know what\nfunctions to call to encode or decode a string using RotUnicode.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import codecs\n    >>> from rotunicode import RotUnicode\n    >>> codecs.register(RotUnicode.search_function)\n    >>> 'Hello World!'.encode('rotunicode')\n    \u0124\u0205\u013e\u013e\u0151 \u0174\u0151\u0155\u013e\u010f!\n\n\nCommand Line\n------------\n\nInstalling RotUnicode also includes a command line tool.\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ rotunicode \"Hello World\"\n    \u0124\u0205\u013e\u013e\u0151 \u0174\u0151\u0155\u013e\u010f!\n    $ rotunicode -d \"\u0124\u0205\u013e\u013e\u0151 \u0174\u0151\u0155\u013e\u010f!\"\n    Hello World!\n    $ echo \"Hello World!\" > hello.txt\n    $ rotunicode -f hello.txt\n    \u0124\u0205\u013e\u013e\u0151 \u0174\u0151\u0155\u013e\u010f!\n    $ cat hello.txt | rotunicode -f\n    \u0124\u0205\u013e\u013e\u0151 \u0174\u0151\u0155\u013e\u010f!\n\n\nWhy should I use RotUnicode?\n----------------------------\n\nRotUnicode it extremely helpful in testing because it reduces the friction for\ndevelopers to test with non-ASCII strings. Imagine for example that you have a\nclass to represent a contact for your address book application:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    class Contact(object):\n\n        def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):\n            super(Contact, self).__init__()\n            self.first_name = first_name\n            self.last_name = last_name\n\n        def display_name(self):\n            return '{} {}'.format(self.first_name, self.last_name)\n\nMost developers would test this as follows:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from unittest import TestCase\n    from contact import Contact\n\n    class ContactTests(TestCase):\n\n        def test_display_name(self):\n            contact = Contact('John', 'Doe\u2019)\n            self.assertEqual('John Doe', contact.display_name()))\n\nThis test is good. But it is going to miss catching problems in the code with\nnon-ASCII characters. Requiring developers to remember how to type non-ASCII\ncharacters is not practical. With RotUnicode, this is super easy:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from unittest import TestCase\n    from contact import Contact\n\n    class ContactTests(TestCase):\n\n        def test_display_name_with_ascii_name(self):\n            contact = Contact(u'John', u'Doe')\n            self.assertEqual(u'John Doe', contact.display_name())\n\n        def test_display_name_with_non_ascii_name(self):\n            contact = Contact(ruencode(u'John'), ruencode(u'Doe'))\n            self.assertEqual(ruencode(u'John Doe'), contact.display_name())\n\n\nThis is an example of a bug in Python\n(`issue18695 <http://bugs.python.org/issue18695>`_) with non-ASCII characters -\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import os, errno\n    >>> name = 'foo'.encode('rotunicode')\n    >>> os.mkdir(name)\n    >>> print(name)\n    \u0192\u0151\u0151\n    >>> os.path.exists(name)\n    True\n    >>> os.statvfs(name)\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n    UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 0-2:\n    ordinal not in range(128)\n\n\nContribute\n----------\n\nSee `CONTRIBUTING <https://github.com/box/rotunicode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_.\n\n\nSetup\n~~~~~\n\nCreate a virtual environment and install packages:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    mkvirtualenv rotunicode\n    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt\n\n\nTesting\n~~~~~~~\n\nRun all tests using:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    tox\n\nThe tox tests include code style checks via pep8 and pylint.\n\n\nCopyright and License\n---------------------\n\n::\n\n Copyright 2014 Box, Inc.
