    "description": "=====================\r\n Javascript Minifier\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nrJSmin is a javascript minifier written in python.\r\n\r\nThe minifier is based on the semantics of `jsmin.c by Douglas Crockford`_\\.\r\n\r\nThe module is a re-implementation aiming for speed, so it can be used at\r\nruntime (rather than during a preprocessing step). Usually it produces the\r\nsame results as the original ``jsmin.c``. It differs in the following ways:\r\n\r\n- there is no error detection: unterminated string, regex and comment\r\n  literals are treated as regular javascript code and minified as such.\r\n- Control characters inside string and regex literals are left untouched; they\r\n  are not converted to spaces (nor to \\n)\r\n- Newline characters are not allowed inside string and regex literals, except\r\n  for line continuations in string literals (ECMA-5).\r\n- \"return /regex/\" is recognized correctly.\r\n- Line terminators after regex literals are handled more sensibly\r\n- \"+ +\" and \"- -\" sequences are not collapsed to '++' or '--'\r\n- Newlines before ! operators are removed more sensibly\r\n- Comments starting with an exclamation mark (``!``) can be kept optionally\r\n- rJSmin does not handle streams, but only complete strings. (However, the\r\n  module provides a \"streamy\" interface).\r\n\r\nSince most parts of the logic are handled by the regex engine it's way faster\r\nthan the original python port of ``jsmin.c`` by Baruch Even. The speed factor\r\nvaries between about 6 and 55 depending on input and python version (it gets\r\nfaster the more compressed the input already is).  Compared to the\r\nspeed-refactored python port by Dave St.Germain the performance gain is less\r\ndramatic but still between 3 and 50 (for huge inputs)). See the\r\ndocs/BENCHMARKS file for details.\r\n\r\nrjsmin.c is a reimplementation of rjsmin.py in C and speeds it up even more.\r\n\r\nBoth python 2 (>=2.4) and python 3 are supported.\r\n\r\n.. _jsmin.c by Douglas Crockford: http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.c\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright and License\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nCopyright 2011 - 2015\r\nAndr\u00e9 Malo or his licensors, as applicable.\r\n\r\nThe whole package (except for the files in the bench/ directory) is\r\ndistributed under the Apache License Version 2.0.
