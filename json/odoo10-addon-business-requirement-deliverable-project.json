Create multiple BR linked to one or several master projects\n#. fill in the deliverables lines and corresponding resources lines (RL)\n#. Properly define your RL description, time and assignee (used for task creation)\n#. Confirm and Approve the Business Requirements\n#. At that stage you can either\n\n  #. Create the project in each business requirement via corresponding button\n  #. Go to the master project and create the projects for all BR related to \n     the master project\n\n#. The wizard is triggered and you can select the following option regarding the\n   hierarchy of projects\n\n  #. Parent project for creation\n  #. Create sub-projects for Business requirements\n  #. Create sub-projects for Deliverables\n  #. Create sub-projects for Child Business requirements\n\nExample\n-------\n\neg: if a master project contains the following BR:\n\n::\n\n    BR1\n    |\n    |- Deliverable Line 1 (DL) containing 2 Resource Lines (RL):\n    |  |\n    |  |- RL1\n    |  `- RL2\n    |\n    BR2\n    |\n    |- DL2\n    |  |\n    |  |- RL3\n    |  `- RL4\n    |\n    |- DL3\n    |  |\n    |  |- RL5\n    |  `- RL6\n    |\n    |- BR3 (Sub BR of BR2)\n       |\n       `- DL4\n          `- RL7\n\n.. figure:: static/img/bus_req_project.png\n   :width: 600 px\n   :alt: Business Requirement Project Wizard\n\nIn the Project creation wizard (above image), if no option is selected:\n\n* No sub project created\n* 7 tasks are created in the master project (for RL1~RL7)\n\nIf option 1 is selected:\n\n* 3 sub projects (parent is Master project), one per BR\n* 7 tasks are created for\n\n  * in project linked to BR1 (2 tasks for RL1 and RL2),\n  * in project linked to BR2 (4 tasks for RL3~6),\n  * in project linked to BR3 (1 task for RL7)\n\nIf option 2 is selected:\n\n* 4 sub projects (parent is Master project), one per DL\n* 7 tasks are created for\n\n  * in project linked to DL1 (2 tasks for RL1 and RL2),\n  * in project linked to DL2 (2 tasks for RL3~4),\n  * in project linked to DL3 (2 tasks for RL5~6) and\n  * in project linked to DL4 (1 task for RL7)\n\nIf options 1+2 are selected:\n\n* 7 sub projects (parent is Master project), one per BR and one per DL\n\n  * BR1 sub-project contains DL1 sub-project,\n  * BR2 sub-project contains DL2 and DL3 sub-projects,\n  * BR3 sub-project contains DL4 sub-project\n\n* 7 tasks are created for\n\n  * in project linked to DL1 (2 tasks for RL1 and RL2),\n  * in project linked to DL2 (2 tasks for RL3~4),\n  * in project linked to DL3 (2 tasks for RL5~6) and\n  * in project linked to DL4 (1 task for RL7)\n\nIf options 1+3 are selected:\n\n* 7 sub projects (parent is Master project), one per BR and sub-BR\n\n  * BR1 sub-project\n  * BR2 sub-project contains BR3 sub-projects,\n\n* 7 tasks are created for\n\n  * in project linked to BR1 (2 tasks for RL1 and RL2),\n  * in project linked to BR2 (4 tasks for RL3~6),\n  * in project linked to BR3 (1 task for RL7)\n\nIf options 1+2+3 are selected:\n\n* 7 sub projects (parent is Master project), one per BR, sub-BR and DL\n\n  * BR1 sub-project contains DL1 sub-project,\n  * BR2 sub-project contains BR3, DL2 and DL3 sub-projects,\n  * BR3 sub-project contains DL4 sub-project\n\n* 7 tasks are created for\n\n  * in project linked to DL1 (2 tasks for RL1 and RL2),\n  * in project linked to DL2 (2 tasks for RL3~4),\n  * in project linked to DL3 (2 tasks for RL5~6) and\n  * in project linked to DL4 (1 task for RL7)\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/222/10.0\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/business-requirement/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed feedback.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n* Eric Caudal<eric.caudal@elico-corp.com>\n* Alex Duan<alex.duan@elico-corp.com>\n* Xie XiaoPeng<xie.xiaopeng@elico-corp.com>\n* Victor M.
