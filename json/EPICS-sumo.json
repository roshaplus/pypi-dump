    "description": "The support module manager sumo is a program to build consistent sets of \r\nEPICS support modules and use them in EPICS applications.\r\n\r\nEPICS is the Experimental Physics Industrial Control System, see also: http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics\r\n\r\nSome of the features are:\r\n\r\n- All module dependencies are held in a JSON dependency database.\r\n\r\n- The dependency database can be managed automatically with a version control \r\n  system in order to keep it in sync on a number of build hosts.\r\n\r\n- In order to migrate your existing support module installation a scanner\r\n  program creates a dependency database from existing support directories.\r\n\r\n- The program builds consistent sets of \r\n  EPICS support modules.\r\n\r\n- The program fetches module source code from various sources, directories, \r\n  tar files or version control systems (currently git, mercurial, darcs,\r\n  subversion and cvs).\r\n  \r\n- If a set of support modules is to be used in an application a RELEASE is\r\n  generated with all the relevant paths.",
