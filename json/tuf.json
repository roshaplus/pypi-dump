TUF addresses\nthis widespread problem by providing a comprehensive, flexible security\nframework that developers can integrate with any software update system.\nThe framework can be easily integrated (or implemented in the native\nprogramming languages of these update systems) due to its concise,\nself-contained architecture and specification.\n\nTUF is hosted by the `Cloud Native Computing Foundation\n<https://www.cncf.io/>`_ (CNCF) and follows the `CNCF Code of Conduct\n<https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md>`_.\n\nWhat Is a Software Update System?\n---------------------------------\n\nGenerally, a software update system is an application (or part of an\napplication) running on a client system that obtains and installs\nsoftware. These systems typically update the applications installed\non client systems to introduce new features, enhancements, and security\nfixes.\n\nThree major classes of software update systems are:\n\n-  **Application updaters** which are used by applications to update\n   themselves. For example, Firefox updates itself through its own\n   application updater.\n\n-  **Library package managers** such as those offered by many\n   programming languages for installing additional libraries. These are\n   systems such as Python's pip/easy_install + PyPI, Perl's CPAN,\n   Ruby's RubyGems, and PHP's Composer.\n\n-  **System package managers** used by operating systems to update and\n   install all of the software on a client system. Debian's APT, Red\n   Hat's YUM, and openSUSE's YaST are examples of these.\n\nOur Approach\n------------\n\nThere are literally thousands of different software update systems in\ncommon use today. (In fact the average Windows user has about `two\ndozen <http://secunia.com/gfx/pdf/Secunia_RSA_Software_Portfolio_Security_Exposure.pdf>`_\ndifferent software updaters on their machine!)\n\nWe are building a library that can be universally (and in most cases\ntransparently) used to secure software update systems.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nOn the surface, the update procedure followed by a software update system can be regarded\nas straightforward.  Obtaining and installing an update just means:\n\n-  Knowing when an update exists.\n-  Downloading the update.\n-  Applying the changes introduced by the update.\n\nThe problem with this view is that it is only straightforward when there\nare no malicious parties involved throughout the update procedure. If an attacker\nis trying to interfere with these seemingly simple steps, there is plenty\nthat they can do.\n\nTUF is designed to perform the first two steps of the above update procedure,\nwhile guarding against the majority of attacks that malicious actors have at\ntheir disposal; especially those attacks that are overlooked by security-conscious\ndevelopers.\n\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nLet's assume you take the approach that most systems do (at least, the\nones that even try to be secure). You download both the file you want\nand a cryptographic signature of the file. You already know which key\nyou trust to make the signature. You check that the signature is correct\nand was made by this trusted key. All seems well, right? Wrong. You are\nstill at risk in many ways, including:\n\n-  An attacker keeps giving you the same file, so you never realize\n   there is an update.\n-  An attacker gives you an older, insecure version of a file that you\n   already have, so you download that one and blindly use it thinking\n   it's newer.\n-  An attacker gives you a newer version of a file you have but it's not\n   the newest one. It's newer to you, but it may be insecure and\n   exploitable by the attacker.\n-  An attacker compromises the key used to sign these files and now you\n   download a malicious file that is properly signed.\n\nThese are just some of the attacks software update systems are\nvulnerable to when only using signed files. See\n`Security <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/SECURITY.md>`_ for a full list of attacks and updater\nweaknesses TUF is designed to prevent.\n\nThe following papers provide detailed information on securing software\nupdater systems, TUF's design and implementation details, attacks on\npackage managers, and package management security:\n\n-  `Mercury: Bandwidth-Effective Prevention of Rollback Attacks Against Community Repositories\n   <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/docs/papers/prevention-rollback-attacks-atc2017.pdf?raw=true>`_\n\n-  `Diplomat: Using Delegations to Protect Community Repositories\n   <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/docs/papers/protect-community-repositories-nsdi2016.pdf?raw=true>`_\n\n-  `Survivable Key Compromise in Software Update\n   Systems <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/docs/papers/survivable-key-compromise-ccs2010.pdf?raw=true>`_\n\n-  `A Look In the Mirror: Attacks on Package\n   Managers <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/docs/papers/package-management-security-tr08-02.pdf?raw=true>`_\n\n-  `Package Management\n   Security <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/docs/papers/attacks-on-package-managers-ccs2008.pdf?raw=true>`_\n\nWhat TUF Does\n-------------\n\nIn order to securely download and verify target files, TUF requires a\nfew extra files to exist on a repository. These are called metadata\nfiles. TUF metadata files contain additional information, including\ninformation about which keys are trusted, the cryptographic hashes of\nfiles, signatures on the metadata, metadata version numbers, and the\ndate after which the metadata should be considered expired.\n\nWhen a software update system using TUF wants to check for updates, it\nasks TUF to do the work. That is, your software update system never has\nto deal with this additional metadata or understand what's going on\nunderneath. If TUF reports back that there are updates available, your\nsoftware update system can then ask TUF to download these files. TUF\ndownloads them and checks them against the TUF metadata that it also\ndownloads from the repository. If the downloaded target files are\ntrustworthy, TUF hands them over to your software update system. See\n`Metadata <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/METADATA.md>`_ for more information and examples.\n\nTUF specification document is also available:\n\n-  `The Update Framework Specification <https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/blob/master/tuf-spec.md>`_\n\nTUF Home Page\n-------------\n\nThe home page for the TUF project can be found at:\nhttps://updateframework.com\n\nSecurity Issues and Bugs\n------------------------\n\nSecurity issues can be reported by emailing justincappos@gmail.com.\n\nAt a minimum, the report must contain the following:\n\n* Description of the vulnerability.\n* Steps to reproduce the issue.\n\nOptionally, reports that are emailed can be encrypted with PGP.  You should use\nPGP key fingerprint E9C0 59EC 0D32 64FA B35F  94AD 465B F9F6 F8EB 475.\n\nPlease do not use the GitHub issue tracker to submit vulnerability reports.\nThe issue tracker is intended for bug reports and to make feature requests.\nMajor feature requests, such as design changes to the specification, should\nbe proposed via TUF Augmentation Proposals, which are discussed below.\n\nMailing List\n------------\nPlease visit\n`https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/theupdateframework\n<https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/theupdateframework>`_ if\nyou would like to contact the TUF team.  Questions, feedback, and suggestions\nare welcomed in this low-volume mailing list.\n\nA group feed is available at:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/feed/theupdateframework/msgs/atom.xml?num=50\n\nWhat is a TAP?\n--------------\n\nA TAP (TUF Augmentation Proposal) is a design document providing information to\nthe TUF community, or describing a new feature for TUF or its processes or\nenvironment.  We intend TAPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major\nnew features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting\nthe design decisions that have gone into TUF.\n\nPlease visit the `TAPs GitHub repo <https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps>`_\nto review design changes that have been proposed to date, or to submit\nyour own new feature.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n::\n\n    pip - installing and managing Python packages (recommended)\n\n    Installing from Python Package Index (https://pypi.python.org/pypi).\n    Note: Please use \"pip install --no-use-wheel tuf\" if your version\n    of pip <= 1.5.6\n    $ pip install tuf\n\n    Installing from local source archive.\n    $ pip install <path to archive>\n\n    Or from the root directory of the unpacked archive.\n    $ pip install .\n\nInstructions for Contributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNote: Development of TUF occurs on the \"develop\" branch of this repository.\n\nContributions can be made by submitting GitHub pull requests.  Submitted code\nshould follow our `code style guidelines\n<https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/code-style-guidelines>`_, which provide\nexamples of what to do (or not to do) when writing Python code.\n\nContributors must also indicate acceptance of the `Developer Certificate of\nOrigin <https://developercertificate.org/>`_  (DCO) when making a contribution\nto the project.  Acceptance of the DCO can be established by appending a\n``Signed-off-by: Your Name <example@domain.com>`` to the Git commit message.\nFor example:\n\n::\n\n    Commit message\n\n    Signed-off-by: Vladimir Diaz <vladimir.v.diaz@gmail.com>\n\nThe required ``Signed-off-by`` text can be automatically appended to the commit\nmessage via the ``-s`` command-line option to ``git commit``:\n\n::\n\n  $ git commit -s -m \"Commit message\"\n\nThe full text of the DCO:\n\n::\n\n    Developer Certificate of Origin\n    Version 1.1\n\n    Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.\n    1 Letterman Drive\n    Suite D4700\n    San Francisco, CA, 94129\n\n    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\n    license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n    Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1\n\n    By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:\n\n    (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the\n    right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or\n\n    (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my\n    knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have\n    the right under that license to submit that work with modifications,\n    whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source\n    license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as\n    indicated in the file; or\n\n    (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who\n    certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.\n\n    (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are\n    public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal\n    information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained\n    indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the\n    open source license(s) involved.\n\n\nTo facilitate development and installation of edited version of the code base,\ndevelopers are encouraged to install `Virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html>`_,\nwhich is a tool to create isolated Python environments.  It includes\n``pip`` and ``setuptools``, Python packages that can be used to\ninstall TUF and its dependencies. All installation methods of\nvirtualenv are outlined in the `installation\nsection <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_,\nand instructions for installing locally from source are provided here:\n::\n\n    $ curl -O https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/v/virtualenv/virtualenv-15.0.3.tar.gz\n    $ tar xvfz virtualenv-15.0.3.tar.gz\n    $ cd virtualenv-15.0.3\n    $ python virtualenv.py myVE\n\nExternal Dependencies\n=====================\n\nBefore installing TUF, a couple of its Python dependencies have non-Python dependencies\nof their own that should installed first.  PyCrypto and PyNaCl (third-party dependencies\nneeded by the repository tools) require Python and FFI (Foreign Function Interface)\ndevelopment header files. Debian-based distributions can install these header\nlibraries with apt (Advanced Package Tool.)\n::\n\n    $ apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev\n\nFedora-based distributions can install these libraries with dnf.\n::\n\n    $ dnf install libffi-devel redhat-rpm-config openssl-devel\n\nOS X users can install these header libraries with the `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_ package manager.\n::\n\n    $ brew install python\n    $ brew install libffi\n\nDevelopment Installation\n========================\n\nInstallation of minimal, optional, development, and testing requirements\ncan then be accomplished with one command:\n::\n\n    $ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt\n\nTesting\n=======\n\nThe Update Framework's unit tests can be executed by invoking\n`tox <https://testrun.org/tox/>`_. All supported Python versions are\ntested, but must already be installed locally.\n::\n\n    $ tox\n\nUsing TUF\n---------\n\nTUF has four major classes of users: clients, for whom TUF is largely\ntransparent; mirrors, who will (in most cases) have nothing at all to do\nwith TUF; upstream servers, who will largely be responsible for care and\nfeeding of repositories; and integrators, who do the work of putting TUF\ninto existing projects.\n\nAn integration requires importing a single module into the new or existing\nsoftware updater and calling particular methods to perform updates.  Generating\nmetadata files stored on upstream servers can be handled by repository tools that\nwe provide for this purpose.\n\n\n- `Integrating with a Software Updater <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/tuf/client/README.md>`_\n\n- `Creating a TUF Repository  <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/tuf/README.md>`_\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis work is `dual-licensed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-licensing>`_\nand distributed under the (1) MIT License and (2) Apache License, Version 2.0.\nPlease see `LICENSE-MIT.txt\n<https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/LICENSE-MIT.txt>`_\nand `LICENSE-APACHE.txt\n<https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/LICENSE-APACHE.txt>`_.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\nThis project is managed by Prof. Justin Cappos and other members of the\n`Secure Systems Lab <https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/>`_ at NYU.\n\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science\nFoundation under Grant Nos.
