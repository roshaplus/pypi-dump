    "description": "A Framework for Securing Software Update Systems\n------------------------------------------------\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/theupdateframework/tuf.svg?branch=develop\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/theupdateframework/tuf\n\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/theupdateframework/tuf/badge.png?branch=develop\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/r/theupdateframework/tuf?branch=develop\n\n\nTUF (The Update Framework) helps developers secure their new or existing\nsoftware update systems. Software update systems are vulnerable to many\nknown attacks, including those that can result in clients being\ncompromised or crashed. TUF helps solve this problem by providing a\nflexible security framework that can be added to software updaters.\n\nWhat Is a Software Update System?\n---------------------------------\n\nGenerally, a software update system is an application (or part of an\napplication) running on a client system that obtains and installs\nsoftware. This can include updates to software that is already installed\nor even completely new software.\n\nThree major classes of software update systems are:\n\n-  **Application updaters** which are used by applications to update\n   themselves. For example, Firefox updates itself through its own\n   application updater.\n\n-  **Library package managers** such as those offered by many\n   programming languages for installing additional libraries. These are\n   systems such as Python's pip/easy_install + PyPI, Perl's CPAN,\n   Ruby's Gems, and PHP's PEAR.\n\n-  **System package managers** used by operating systems to update and\n   install all of the software on a client system. Debian's APT, Red\n   Hat's YUM, and openSUSE's YaST are examples of these.\n\nOur Approach\n------------\n\nThere are literally thousands of different software update systems in\ncommon use today. (In fact the average Windows user has about `two\ndozen <http://secunia.com/gfx/pdf/Secunia_RSA_Software_Portfolio_Security_Exposure.pdf>`_\ndifferent software updaters on their machine!)\n\nWe are building a library that can be universally (and in most cases\ntransparently) used to secure software update systems.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nAt the highest level, TUF simply provides applications with a secure\nmethod of obtaining files and knowing when new versions of files are\navailable. We call these files, the ones that are supposed to be\ndownloaded, \"target files\". The most common need for these abilities is\nin software update systems and that's what we had in mind when creating\nTUF.\n\nOn the surface, this all sounds simple. Securely obtaining updates just\nmeans:\n\n-  Knowing when an update exists.\n-  Downloading the updated file.\n\nThe problem is that this is only simple when there are no malicious\nparties involved. If an attacker is trying to interfere with these\nseemingly simple steps, there is plenty they can do.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nLet's assume you take the approach that most systems do (at least, the\nones that even try to be secure). You download both the file you want\nand a cryptographic signature of the file. You already know which key\nyou trust to make the signature. You check that the signature is correct\nand was made by this trusted key. All seems well, right? Wrong. You are\nstill at risk in many ways, including:\n\n-  An attacker keeps giving you the same file, so you never realize\n   there is an update.\n-  An attacker gives you an older, insecure version of a file that you\n   already have, so you download that one and blindly use it thinking\n   it's newer.\n-  An attacker gives you a newer version of a file you have but it's not\n   the newest one. It's newer to you, but it may be insecure and\n   exploitable by the attacker.\n-  An attacker compromises the key used to sign these files and now you\n   download a malicious file that is properly signed.\n\nThese are just some of the attacks software update systems are\nvulnerable to when only using signed files. See\n`Security <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/SECURITY.md>`_ for a full list of attacks and updater\nweaknesses TUF is designed to prevent.\n\nThe following papers provide detailed information on securing software\nupdater systems, TUF's design and implementation details, attacks on\npackage managers, and package management security:\n\n-  `Survivable Key Compromise in Software Update\n   Systems <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/docs/papers/survivable-key-compromise-ccs2010.pdf?raw=true>`_\n\n-  `A Look In the Mirror: Attacks on Package\n   Managers <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/docs/papers/package-management-security-tr08-02.pdf?raw=true>`_\n\n-  `Package Management\n   Security <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/docs/papers/attacks-on-package-managers-ccs2008.pdf?raw=true>`_\n\nWhat TUF Does\n-------------\n\nIn order to securely download and verify target files, TUF requires a\nfew extra files to exist on a repository. These are called metadata\nfiles. TUF metadata files contain additional information, including\ninformation about which keys are trusted, the cryptographic hashes of\nfiles, signatures on the metadata, metadata version numbers, and the\ndate after which the metadata should be considered expired.\n\nWhen a software update system using TUF wants to check for updates, it\nasks TUF to do the work. That is, your software update system never has\nto deal with this additional metadata or understand what's going on\nunderneath. If TUF reports back that there are updates available, your\nsoftware update system can then ask TUF to download these files. TUF\ndownloads them and checks them against the TUF metadata that it also\ndownloads from the repository. If the downloaded target files are\ntrustworthy, TUF hands them over to your software update system. See\n`Metadata <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/METADATA.md>`_ for more information and examples.\n\nTUF specification document is also available:\n\n-  `The Update Framework Specification <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/docs/tuf-spec.txt?raw=true>`_\n\nTUF Home Page\n-------------\n\nThe home page for the TUF project can be found at:\nhttps://updateframework.com\n\nMailing List\n------------\nPlease visit `https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/theupdateframework <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/theupdateframework>`_ if you would like to contact the TUF team.  Questions, feedback, and suggestions are welcomed in this low-volume mailing list.\n\nA group feed is available at: https://groups.google.com/forum/feed/theupdateframework/msgs/atom.xml?num=50\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n::\n\n    pip - installing and managing Python packages (recommended)\n\n    Installing from Python Package Index (https://pypi.python.org/pypi).\n    Note: Please use \"pip install --no-use-wheel tuf\" if your version\n    of pip <= 1.5.6\n    $ pip install tuf\n\n    Installing from local source archive.\n    $ pip install <path to archive>\n\n    Or from the root directory of the unpacked archive.\n    $ pip install . \n\nInstallation of Optional Requirements (after minimal install)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe optional ``tuf[tools]`` can be installed by repository maintainers\nthat need to generate TUF repository files, such as metadata,\ncryptographic keys, and signatures. Whereas the minimal install can only\nverify ed25519 signatures and is intended for sofware updater clients,\n``tuf[tools]`` provides repository maintainers secure ed25519 key and\nsignature generation with PyNaCl / libsodium.\n\nTUF tools also enable general-purpose cryptography with PyCrypto.\nSoftware updaters that want to support verification of RSASSA-PSS\nsignatures should require their clients to install ``tuf[tools]``.\n\nInstalling extras does not work if minimal install was a wheel (pip <= 1.5.6.)\n`https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/1885 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/1885>`_\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install --no-use-wheel tuf\n    $ pip install tuf[tools]\n\nInstructions for Contributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDevelopment: `https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf>`_\n\n`Virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html>`_\nis a tool to create isolated Python environments. It also includes\n``pip`` and ``setuptools``, Python packages used to install TUF and its\ndependencies. All installation methods of virtualenv are outlined in the\n`installation\nsection <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_\nand instructions for installing locally from source here:\n::\n\n    $ curl -O https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/v/virtualenv/virtualenv-1.11.6.tar.gz\n    $ tar xvfz virtualenv-1.11.6.tar.gz\n    $ cd virtualenv-1.11.6\n    $ python virtualenv.py myVE\n\n\nPyCrypto and PyNaCl (third-party dependencies needed by the repository\ntools) require Python and FFI (Foreign Function Interface) development\nheader files. Debian-based distributions can install these header\nlibraries with apt (Advanced Package Tool.)\n::\n\n    $ apt-get install python-dev\n    $ apt-get install libffi-dev\n\nInstallation of minimal, optional, development, and testing requirements\ncan then be accomplished with one command:\n::\n\n    $ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt\n\nThe Update Framework's unit tests can be executed by invoking\n`tox <https://testrun.org/tox/>`_. All supported Python versions are\ntested, but must already be installed locally.\n::\n\n    $ tox\n\nUsing TUF\n---------\n\nTUF has four major classes of users: clients, for whom TUF is largely\ntransparent; mirrors, who will (in most cases) have nothing at all to do\nwith TUF; upstream servers, who will largely be responsible for care and\nfeeding of repositories; and integrators, who do the work of putting TUF\ninto existing projects.\n\nA low-level integration requires importing a single module and calling\nparticular methods to perform updates.  A high-level integration, on the\nother hand, can handle TUF-related updates transparently.  The client\npopulates a configuration file and the library interposes on urllib calls.\nGenerating metadata files stored on upstream servers can be handled by the\nrepository tool, covered in ``Creating a Repository``.\n\n\n-  `Creating a Repository <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/tuf/README.md>`_\n\n-  `Low-level Integration <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/tuf/client/README.md>`_\n\n-  `High-level Integration <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/tuf/interposition/README.md>`_\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science\nFoundation under Grant No. CNS-1345049 and CNS-0959138.
