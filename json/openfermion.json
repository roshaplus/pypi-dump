    "description": "OpenFermion\n===========\n\nOpenFermion is an open source effort for compiling and analyzing quantum algorithms to simulate fermionic systems, including quantum chemistry. The current version is an alpha release which features data structures and tools for obtaining and manipulating representations of fermionic Hamiltonians.\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\nTo start using OpenFermion, clone this git repo, change directory to the top level folder and then run:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  python -m pip install -e .\n\nAlternatively, one can install using pip with the command\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  python -m pip install openfermion\n\nFor further information about how to get started please see `intro <http://openfermion.org>`__ and  `code examples <http://openfermion.org>`__. Also take a look at the the ipython notebook demo in the examples folder of this repository as well as our detailed `code documentation <http://openfermion.org>`__.\n\nPlugins\n-------\n\nIn order to simulate and compile quantum circuits or perform other complicated electronic structure calculations, one can install OpenFermion plugins. We currently support a circuit simulation plugin for `ProjectQ <https://projectq.ch>`__, which you can find at `OpenFermion-ProjectQ <http://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion-PySCF>`__. We also support electronic structure plugins for `Psi4 <http://psicode.org>`__, which you can find at `OpenFermion-Psi4 <http://openfermion.org>`__ (recommended), and for `PySCF <https://github.com/sunqm/pyscf>`__, which you can find at `OpenFermion-PySCF <http://openfermion.org>`__.\n\nHow to contribute\n-----------------\n\nWe'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are\njust a few small guidelines you need to follow.\n\nContributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License\nAgreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution,\nthis simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as\npart of the project. Head over to https://cla.developers.google.com/ to see\nyour current agreements on file or to sign a new one. You generally only need\nto submit a CLA once unless you change employers.\n\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review.\nWe use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult\n`GitHub Help <https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/>`__ for\nmore information on using pull requests.\n\nFurthermore, please make sure your new code comes with extensive tests! We\nuse automatic testing to make sure all pull requests pass tests and do not\ndecrease overall test coverage by too much. Make sure you adhere to our style\nguide. Just have a look at our code for clues. We mostly follow pep8 and use\nthe pep8 linter to check for it. Code should always come with documentation,\nwhich is generated automatically and can be found\n`here <http://openfermion.org>`_.\n\nAuthors\n-------\n\n`Ryan Babbush <http://ryanbabbush.com>`__ (Google),\n`Jarrod McClean <http://jarrodmcclean.com>`__ (Google),\nIan Kivlichan (Harvard),\nDamian Steiger (ETH Zurich),\nWei Sun (Google),\nCraig Gidney (Google),\nThomas Haner (ETH Zurich),\nHannah Sim (Harvard),\nVojtech Havlicek (Oxford),\nKanav Setia (Dartmouth),\nNicholas Rubin (Rigetti),\nMatthew Neeley (Google) and\nDave Bacon (Google).\n\nQuestions?\n----------\n\nIf you have any other questions, please contact help@openfermion.org.\n\nDisclaimer\n----------\nCopyright 2017 The OpenFermion Developers.
