    "description": "# Elucidation of Signaling Pathways from Large-Scale Phosphoproteomic Data Using Protein Interaction Networks\n\nPhosphoproteomic experiments typically identify sites within a protein that are differentially phosphorylated between two or more cell states. However, the interpretation of these data is hampered by the lack of methods that can translate site-specific information into global maps of active proteins and signaling networks, especially as the phosphoproteome is often undersampled. Here, we describe PHOTON, a method for interpreting phosphorylation data within their signaling context, as captured by protein-protein interaction networks, to identify active proteins and pathways and pinpoint functional phosphosites. We apply PHOTON to interpret existing and novel phosphoproteomic datasets related to epidermal growth factor and insulin responses. PHOTON substantially outperforms the widely used cutoff approach, providing highly reproducible predictions that are more in line with current biological knowledge. Altogether, PHOTON overcomes the fundamental challenge of delineating signaling pathways from large-scale phosphoproteomic data, thereby enabling translation of environmental cues to downstream cellular responses.\n\n[Pubmed link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28009266)\n\n# Output description\nA zip archive containing several output tables can be downloaded from the results page of PHOTON.\n\n1. `subnet.csv`: edges of the reconstructed signaling network. This is a sub-network of the input network (which is located at `/db/anat/H_sapiens.net`). The `subnet.csv` file can be e.g. imported into Cytoscape for further analysis.\n2. `scores.csv`: signaling functionality scores devised by PHOTON. The 'Significant' column allows for easy filtering of the table. The other columns provide more detail on each step of the algorithm, i.e. calculating an empirical score, obtaining p-values, and finally FDR-corrected q-values.\n3. `go_scores.csv`: details all GO annotation enrichment results for the reconstructed network. Filtering for the 'rejected' column (=1) will yield all sign. enriched categories. The naming of the other columns follows the convention of the [statistical test](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.hypergeom.html) used.\n4. `predictions.csv`: contains information regarding the functional phosphorylation site prediction. The '[proba](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.predict_proba)' column is the prediction score for each site. If the phosphorylation site was part of the training set the 'label' column will be 'TRUE'. One should take special care when the training set was small, i.e. few sites with 'label' set to TRUE are in the data set.\n\n## My result graph contains only a sigle node '-1'\nSometimes PHOTON will not yield any results. Known technical sources of failure are:\n\n1. The ANAT service is down. PHOTON relies on the [ANAT web server](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~bnet/ANAT/) which can be down for various reasons. Before reporting an error with PHOTON, please confirm that the Cytoscape plugin for ANAT is working as expected. Please note that you might still download the resulting activity scores derived by PHOTON.\n\n## Common errors when running PHOTON\n\n1. Uploading a data file which is not `ASCII` encoded might yield errors such as\n    \n        'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xa0 in position 0: invalid start byte\n        \n   Converting the file to `ASCII` will fix this issue.\n2. There is a popup with a long error message similar to\n\n        <ns2:confidence>0.6912981534952782</ns2:confidence>\n        <ns2:fromNodeId>473</ns2:fromNodeId>\n        <ns2:toNodeId>126961</ns2:toNodeId>\n        </ns2:edgesData>\n        <ns2:edgesData>\n        ...\n        \n    This error messages is due to the [ANAT web server](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~bnet/ANAT/) not being available.\n    Please confirm that the Cytoscape plugin for ANAT is working as expected before reporting an error for PHOTON.\n    Please contact me or the authors of ANAT in case of errors.\n    \n# Running PHOTON through Perseus\n\n## Installation\n1. Download [Perseus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27348712) from [here](http://www.coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=perseus:common:download_and_installation).\n2. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n3. Install [perseuspy](https://github.com/jdrudolph/perseuspy).\n4. In the same way, install PHOTON by running `pip install photon_ptm`.\n5. Download `PluginInterop` ([more...](https://github.com/jdrudolph/PluginInterop)) and `PluginPHOTON`\nfrom the [plugin store](http://www.coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=perseus:user:plugins:store).\n\n## Usage\n1. Load the `H_sapiens.txt` file using `Generic matrix upload`.\n2. Filter the rows by `Confidence > 0.5`.\n3. Create a network from the matrix.\n4. Load the experimental data.\n5. Annotate the nodes of the network with the experimental data.\n6. Run PHOTON from Network => Processing => Modifications => PHOTON.\n7. Use the full network for e.g. enrichment analysis. The reconstructed subnetworks can be\nvisualized. Signaling functionality scores are reported in a separate table and can be used\nfor clustering etc.\n\n# Running PHOTON on Docker\n\nPHOTON runs inside a 'container' and therefore requires docker to run across all platforms.\nGeneral information regarding the installation of docker can be\nfound on the docker [website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).\n\n\n## Docker Toolbox (Windows, Mac)\n\nFirst open the `Docker Quickstart Terminal`. After initialization (can take some time),\ndenote the IP address of docker (under the whale image).\nNow you can run PHOTON by entering:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d -p 5000:5000 jdrudolph/photon\n```\n\nNow you can access PHOTON from your browser under the IP address\nof docker followed by colon and 5000. For example `192.168.0.100:5000`.\nAlternatively you can lookup the IP address using `docker-machine ip default`.\n\n## Docker for Windows / Linux\n\nOpen a Powershell (terminal in linux) and run:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d -p 5000:5000 jdrudolph/photon\n```\n\nNow you can access PHOTON from your [browser](http://localhost:5000).\n\n## Native Linux (Experts)\n\nConsult the `Dockerfile` on how to run PHOTON on Linux natively.\n\n# Stopping PHOTON\n\nFirst list all running containers:\n\n```bash\ndocker ps\n```\n\nLookup the name of the container (last column) and stop it using\n\n```bash\ndocker stop name_of_container\n```\n\n# Updating PHOTON\n\nNew versions of docker can be downloaded by running\n\n```bash\ndocker pull jdrudolph/photon\n```\n\nbefore issuing the `run` command as shown above.\n\n# Troubleshooting\nPlease open an issue [here](https://github.com/jdrudolph/photon/issues), or\ncontact me directly if you have issues with installing or using PHOTON.\n\n# Licence\nIf the current licencing (see `LICENCE.txt`) does not suit your needs,\nplease contacte me for alternative licencing options.\n\n# PHOTON data format example\n\n    GeneID,Amino.Acid,Position,avg,Symbol\n    5097,S,962,-0.47417884405658556,PCDH1\n    5097,S,984,-0.6438018715183813,PCDH1\n    4300,S,522,-0.5172999908818245,MLLT3\n    81628,S,264,0.8682687511988673,TSC22D4\n    81628,S,279,2.684096205546553,TSC22D4\n    4034,S,25,-0.593695490783283,LRCH4\n    4034,S,380,1.6585730683114723,LRCH4\n    6651,S,1822,0.046145203537912814,SON\n    6651,S,1737,-0.06153405253207198,SON\n \n",
