    "description": "Utility for converting numbers to/from different bases/alphabets. Common bases have convenience aliases (see https://github.com/belldandu/bases.py#usage && https://github.com/belldandu/bases.py#api), but arbitrary/custom alphabets can be used.\r\n\r\nAs most people have noticed pythons int() only supports one way base conversions.\r\ne.g.( int('lol',36) # 28101 ). Pythons format() also only supports conversion the other way up to base 16. This library was created to help those python programmers by providing a bases conversion system that works both ways, can use customized conversions and supports from base 2 all the way up to base 64 all in one library.",
