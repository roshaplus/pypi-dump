    "description": "Evennia\r\n=======\r\n\r\n*Evennia* is a library for creating and running modern multiplayer online text games (aka MUD, MUX, MUSH, MUCK, MOO and other MU*). Users can play using traditional third-party clients but also via the included html5 web application. Evennia is also its own web server and can host your game's website along with data from your game database.\r\n\r\nDeveloping using Evennia simply means inheriting and expanding Python classes. You can easily import your custom Python modules or use any external Python library to implement any advanced functionality you like. This offers game developers the chance to build their own dream game without having to worry about gritty details such as database management and connection protocols.\r\n\r\nEvennia will out of the box set you up with an fully functioning, if empty, game. The library offers the building blocks but does not itself impose any hard-coded systems on you, so you are free to yourself create combat systems, races or what have you (we offer a growing list of optional contributions and tutorials to build from).\r\n\r\nThe API is well-documented and there is an extensive documentation with many tutorials. From the Evennia homepage one can also find an active mailing list and IRC chat room to get help from the community.",
