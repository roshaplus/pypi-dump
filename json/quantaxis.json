    "description": "QUANTAXIS quantitative financial strategy framework\n==========================\n\nQUANTAXIS quantitative framework to achieve the stock and futures market, the whole species back to the test.Through the distributed crawler for data capture, to build a response to the data cleaning and market push engine to build a multi-language open response frame. And build interactive visualization of clients and websites.\n\n\n0.4.0-alpha-dev02 Release Note\n---------------------------------\n\n\nTaking into account such a scenario, an organization's strategy team is generally composed of CS + Finance, Finance students are very good at data analysis, strategy, but not very understanding of the underlying structure of the code, code style and standards are different While CS students are well aware of the code and framework, they are struggling with the financial theory of boring holes, and the current domestic support for quantitative services can not solve this common scene pain points, or for financial students Easy to operate the analysis system, but for IT in terms of the lack of customizable part; either for the underlying IT data and transaction interface, and for financial students want to package out from the underlying interface, a set of available efficient framework It is difficult to ascend to heaven.\n\nQUNATAXIS is committed to solving this problem, and we solve this problem by creating a standard framework within a RESTful-based LAN that is separated from front and back, and we hope that our framework is highly scalable and easy to access The company's individual strategy team's individual needs (this is the most critical, basically every company will have its own data, their own trading interface, their own specific functional goals), so we want to build a standardized, high Scalable, easy to deploy scaffolding, rather than a complete hard to customize solution.\n\nQUANTAXIS front and back completely separated, highly split, each component relies on RESTful standard URI to communicate, which also gives us an open framework of infinite possibilities, can achieve Matlab, r, python, javascript, C, C + +, rust And other users of the harmonious coexistence, rather than increase the cost of learning to learn a common language.At the same time, as long as a public network IP and server, you can also go beyond the LAN restrictions, to achieve the needs of remote teams.\n\n\n=============\n\n[QAS] QUANTAXIS standard protocol\n\n## Introduction Intro\nQAProtocol is a protocol established to standardize and standardize QUANTAXIS data acquisition, data storage, simulated market transactions, and standardized output.\n### QUANTAXIS Standard Protocol [QAS]\nQUANTAXISStandard is the current protocol standard, referred to as ** QAS **\n### QUANTTAXIS Future Protocol [QAF]\nQUANTAXISFuture is the future will be added or in the beta version of the functional standards, referred to as ** QAF **\n## QAStandard-00x QUANTAXIS\n### QAStandard-001 brand\nQUANTAXIS Logo needs to follow the docs / logo logo under the logo, there are two forms of logo\n\n<Img width = \"150\" height = \"150\" src = \"http://i4.buimg.com/567571/62c510db7915837a.png\" />\n<Img width = \"150\" height = \"150\" src = \"http://i4.buimg.com/567571/2120bbe28a4a9a4b.png\" />\n\n### QAStandard-002 open source protocol\nQUANTAXIS is based on the MIT open source protocol\n`` ``\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016-2017 yutiansut / QUANTAXIS\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nOf this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nIn the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nTo use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and / or sell\nCopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nFurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\nCopies or gt copies of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
