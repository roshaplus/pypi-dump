Simply add more workers.\n\nFlexibility\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can choose your mails input sources (with **spouts**) and your\nfunctionalities (with **bolts**).\n\nSpamScope comes with the following bolts: - tokenizer splits mail in\ntoken like headers, body, attachments and it can filter emails,\nattachments and ip addresses already seen - phishing looks for your\nkeywords in email and connects email to targets (bank, your customers,\netc.) - raw\\_mail is for all third party tools that analyze raw mails\nlike SpamAssassin - attachments analyzes all mail attachments and uses\nthird party tools like VirusTotal - network analyzes all sender ip\naddresses with third party tools like Shodan - urls extracts all urls in\nemail and attachments - json\\_maker and outputs make the json report and\nsave it\n\nStore where you want\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can build your custom output bolts and store your data in\nElasticsearch, MongoDB, filesystem, etc.\n\nBuild your topology\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWith streamparse tecnology you can build your topology in Python, add\nand/or remove spouts and bolts.\n\nAPI\n~~~\n\nFor now SpamScope doesn't have its own API, because it isn't tied to any\ntecnology. If you use ``Redis`` as spout (input), you'll use Redis API\nto put mails in topology. If you use ``Elasticsearch`` as output, you'll\nuse Elasticsearch API to get results.\n\nIt's possible to develop a middleware API that it talks with input,\noutput and changes the configuration, but now there isn't.\n\nApache 2 Open Source License\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSpamScope can be downloaded, used, and modified free of charge. It is\navailable under the Apache 2 license.\n\n|Donate|\n\nSpamScope on Web\n----------------\n\n-  `Shodan Applications &\n   Integrations <https://developer.shodan.io/apps>`__\n-  `The Honeynet Project <http://honeynet.org/node/1329>`__\n-  `securityonline.info <http://securityonline.info/pcileech-direct-memory-access-dma-attack-software/>`__\n-  `jekil/awesome-hacking <https://github.com/jekil/awesome-hacking>`__\n\nOutput example\n--------------\n\n-  `Raw example email <https://goo.gl/wMBfbF>`__.\n-  `SpamScope output <https://goo.gl/MS7ugy>`__.\n-  `SpamScope complete output <https://goo.gl/fr4i7C>`__.\n\nAuthors\n-------\n\nMain Author\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFedele Mantuano (**LinkedIn**: `Fedele\nMantuano <https://www.linkedin.com/in/fmantuano/>`__)\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nFor more details please visit the `wiki\npage <https://github.com/SpamScope/spamscope/wiki/Installation>`__.\n\nClone repository\n\n::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/SpamScope/spamscope.git\n\nEnter in SpamScope directory install it:\n\n::\n\n    python setup.py install\n\nFaup\n~~~~\n\n`Faup <https://github.com/stricaud/faup>`__ stands for Finally An Url\nParser and is a library and command line tool to parse URLs and\nnormalize fields. To install it follow the\n`wiki <https://github.com/SpamScope/spamscope/wiki/Installation#faup>`__.\n\nSpamAssassin (optional)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSpamScope can use `SpamAssassin <http://spamassassin.apache.org/>`__ an\nopen source anti-spam to analyze every mails.\n\nTika (optional)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSpamScope can use `Tika App <https://tika.apache.org/>`__ to parse every\nattachments. The **Apache Tika** toolkit detects and extracts metadata\nand text from over a thousand different file types (such as PPT, XLS,\nand PDF). To install it follow the\n`wiki <https://github.com/SpamScope/spamscope/wiki/Installation#tika-app-optional>`__.\nTo enable Apache Tika analisys, you should set it in ``attachments``\nsection.\n\nThug (optional)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFrom release v1.3 SpamScope can analyze Javascript and HTML attachments\nwith `Thug <https://github.com/buffer/thug>`__. If you want to analyze\nthe attachments with Thug, follow `these\ninstructions <http://buffer.github.io/thug/doc/build.html>`__ to install\nit and enable it in ``attachments`` section.\n\nWhat is Thug? From README project:\n\n::\n\n    Thug is a Python low-interaction honeyclient aimed at mimicing the behavior of a web browser in order to detect and emulate malicious contents.\n\nYou can see a complete SpamScope report with Thug analysis\n`here <https://goo.gl/Y4kWCv>`__.\n\nVirusTotal (optional)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIt's possible add to results (for mail attachments and sender ip\naddress) the VirusTotal report. You need a private API key.\n\nShodan (optional)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIt's possible add to results the Shodan report for sender ip address.\nYou need a private API key.\n\nElasticsearch (optional)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIt's possible to store the results in Elasticsearch. In this case you\nshould install ``elasticsearch`` package.\n\nRedis (optional)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIt's possible to store the results in Redis. In this case you should\ninstall ``redis`` package.\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nFor more details please visit the `wiki\npage <https://github.com/SpamScope/spamscope/wiki/Configuration>`__ or\nread the comments in the files in ``conf`` folder.\n\nYou can decide to **filter emails, attachments and ip addresses**\nalready analyzed. All filters are in ``tokenizer`` bolt section.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nSpamScope comes with three topologies: - spamscope\\_debug (save json on\nfile system) - spamscope\\_elasticsearch - spamscope\\_redis\n\nand a general configuration file ``spamscope.example.yml`` in ``conf/``\nfolder.\n\nIf you want submit SpamScope topology use ``spamscope-topology submit``\ntool. For more details ``spamscope-topology submit -h``:\n\n::\n\n    $ spamscope-topology submit --topology {spamscope_debug,spamscope_elasticsearch,spamscope_redis}\n\nImportant\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nIt's very important to set the main configuration file. The default\nvalue is ``/etc/spamscope/spamscope.yml``, but it's possible to set the\nenvironment variable ``SPAMSCOPE_CONF_FILE``:\n\n::\n\n    $ export SPAMSCOPE_CONF_FILE=/etc/spamscope/spamscope.yml\n\nIf you use Elasticsearch output, I suggest you to use Elasticsearch\ntemplate that comes with SpamScope.\n\nApache Storm settings\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIt's possible change the default settings for all Apache Storm options.\nI suggest for SpamScope these options:\n\n-  **topology.tick.tuple.freq.secs**: reload configuration of all bolts\n-  **topology.max.spout.pending**: Apache Storm framework will then\n   throttle your spout as needed to meet the\n   ``topology.max.spout.pending`` requirement\n-  **topology.sleep.spout.wait.strategy.time.ms**: max sleep for emit\n   new tuple (mail)\n\nFor more details you can refer\n`here <http://streamparse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html>`__.\n\nTo simplify this operation, SpamScope comes with a custom tool\n``spamscope-topology submit`` where you can choose the values of all\nthese parameters.\n\nUnittest\n--------\n\nSpamScope comes with unittests for each modules. In bolts and spouts\nthere are no special features, all intelligence is in external modules.\nAll unittests are in ``tests`` folder.\n\nTo have complete tests you should set the followings enviroment\nvariables:\n\n::\n\n    $ export THUG_ENABLED=True\n    $ export VIRUSTOTAL_ENABLED=True\n    $ export VIRUSTOTAL_APIKEY=\"your key\"\n    $ export ZEMANA_ENABLED=True\n    $ export ZEMANA_APIKEY=\"your key\"\n    $ export ZEMANA_PARTNERID=\"your partner id\"\n    $ export ZEMANA_USERID=\"your userid\" \n    $ export SHODAN_ENABLED=True\n    $ export SHODAN_APIKEY=\"your key\"\n    $ export SPAMASSASSIN_ENABLED=True\n\nDocker images\n-------------\n\nIt's possible to use complete Docker images with Apache Storm and\nSpamScope. Take the following images:\n\n-  `Root <https://hub.docker.com/r/fmantuano/spamscope-root/>`__\n-  `Elasticsearch <https://hub.docker.com/r/fmantuano/spamscope-elasticsearch/>`__\n\nFor each image there are two tags: **develop** and **latest**.\n\nScreenshots\n-----------\n\n.. figure:: docs/images/Docker00.png?raw=true\n   :alt: Apache Storm\n\n   Apache Storm\n\n.. figure:: docs/images/Docker01.png?raw=true\n   :alt: SpamScope\n\n   SpamScope\n\n.. figure:: docs/images/Docker02.png?raw=true\n   :alt: SpamScope Topology\n\n   SpamScope Topology\n\n.. figure:: docs/images/map.png?raw=true\n   :alt: SpamScope Map\n\n   SpamScope Map\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/SpamScope/spamscope.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/SpamScope/spamscope\n.. |Coverage Status| image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/SpamScope/spamscope/badge.svg?branch=develop\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/SpamScope/spamscope?branch=develop\n.. |BCH compliance| image:: https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/SpamScope/spamscope?branch=develop\n   :target: https://bettercodehub.com/\n.. |Donate| image:: https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif\n   :target: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=VEPXYP745KJF2\n",
