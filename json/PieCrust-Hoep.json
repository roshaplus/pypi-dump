    "description": "This plugin for `PieCrust`_ lets you use `Hoedown Markdown`_ via `Hoep`_ for\nfaster Markdown processing. It's much faster than the default pure Python (but\nmore universal) Markdown formatter that comes by default with PieCrust. It\nshould be totally compatible with it, however, in the sense that dropping this\nplugin in your website should make it bake faster with no discernable change.\n\n\n.. _piecrust: http://bolt80.com/piecrust/\n.. _hoedown markdown: https://github.com/hoedown/hoedown\n.. _hoep: https://github.com/Anomareh/Hoep",
