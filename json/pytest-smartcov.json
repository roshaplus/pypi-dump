    "description": "===============\npytest-smartcov\n===============\n\nSmart coverage measurement and reporting for py.test test suites.\n\nTest suites are usually structured parallel to (or integrated with) the\nstructure of the code they test. If you ask py.test to run a certain subset of\nyour tests, you shouldn't have to also tell coverage which subset of your code\nit should measure coverage on for that run. With ``pytest-smartcov``, you don't\nhave to.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n=============\n\n``pytest-smartcov`` requires Python 2.7 or higher and `coverage`_ 3.6 or higher.\n\n.. _coverage: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nIf ``pytest-smartcov`` is installed and you provide a ``smartcov_paths_hook``\nsetting in your ``pytest.ini``, coverage will automatically be measured on all\nyour test runs, unless you provide the ``--no-cov`` flag.\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nTo use ``pytest-smartcov``, provide a ``smartcov_paths_hook`` ini-config\nsetting which is the Python dotted import path to a function. This function\nshould accept as its single parameter the list of test paths specified on a\n``py.test`` command line, and should return the list of paths on which code\ncoverage will be measured.\n\n\nReporting\n---------\n\nIf 100% of the measured code was covered, ``pytest-smartcov`` will output a\nsingle line at the end of test run notifying you that you have 100% coverage.\n\nIf you have less than 100% coverage on the measured code, ``pytest-smartcov``\nwill output a terminal report including only those files which had less than\n100% coverage.\n\nIf there was less than 100% overall coverage, ``pytest-smartcov`` will also\noutput an HTML report (to the ``htmlcov/`` directory by default, though this\ncan be configured normally in ``.coveragerc``).\n\n\nCHANGES\n=======\n\n\n0.1 (2014.10.28)\n----------------\n\n* Initial working version.",
