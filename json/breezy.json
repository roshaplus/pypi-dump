    "description": "=================\nREADME for Breezy\n=================\n\nBreezy (``brz``) is a decentralized revision control system, designed to be\neasy for developers and end users alike.\n\nYou can install from source by following the instructions in the INSTALL file.\nAt the moment of writing there are no binary packages available.\n\nTo learn how to use Breezy, see the official documentation in the `doc`\ndirectory or refer to the Bazaar documentation at\n<https://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/en/>.\n\nFor additional training materials including screencasts and slides,\nvisit the Bazaar community wiki documentation page at:\n\n    http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/Documentation/\n\nBreezy is Free Software, and is released under the GNU General Public License,\nversion 2 or later.\n\nBreezy is a friendly fork of the Bazaar (``bzr``) project, hosted on\nhttp://bazaar.canonical.com/. It is backwards compatibility with\nBazaar's disk format and protocols.\n\n\nBreezy highlights\n=================\n\nBreezy directly supports both central version control (like cvs/svn) and\ndistributed version control (like git/hg). Developers can organize their\nworkspace in whichever way they want on a per project basis including:\n\n* checkouts (like svn)\n* feature branches (like hg)\n* shared working tree (like git).\n\nIt also directly supports and encourages a large number of development best\npractices like refactoring and pre-commit regression testing. Users can\nchoose between our command line tool and our cross-platform GUI application.\nFor further details, see our website.\n\nFeedback\n========\n\nIf you encounter any problems with BReezy , need help understanding it, or would\nlike to offer suggestions or feedback, please get in touch with us:\n\n* Ask a question through our web support interface, at\n  https://answers.launchpad.net/brz/\n\n* Report bugs at https://bugs.launchpad.net/brz/+filebug\n\n* Write to the mailing list at bazaar@lists.canonical.com\n  You can join the list at <https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/bazaar>.\n  You don't need to subscribe to post, but your first post will be held\n  briefly for manual moderation.\n\n  Please mention that you are using Breezy rather than Bazaar.\n\n* Talk to us in irc://irc.ubuntu.com/bzr\n\n  Please mention that you are using Breezy rather than Bazaar.\n\nOur mission is to make a version control tool that developers LOVE to use\nand that casual contributors feel confident with. Please let us know how\nwe're going.\n\nThe Breezy Team\n",
