Guake's style of window is\nbased on an FPS game, and one of its goals is to be easy to reach.\n\nRequest Features\n----------------\n\nPlease vote for feature on `FeatHub <http://feathub.com/Guake/guake>`.\nOpen Issues on GitHub only for bug reports.\n\nMost requested features list for Guake:\n\n|feathub-badge|_\n\n.. |feathub-badge| image:: http://feathub.com/Guake/guake?format=svg\n.. _feathub-badge: http://feathub.com/Guake/guake\n\n\nGuake 3 Port\n============\n\nGuake has recently been ported Gtk3, thanks to the huge work of @aichingm.\nOld releases and code depending on GTK2 have been put on the\n`0.8.x <https://github.com/Guake/guake/tree/0.8.x>`_ branch and will no more be actively maintained.\n\nGuake has also been ported to Python 3. It works well with Python 3.5 and it is recommended to use\nit with this version, since system dependencies might not work well on all systems with 3.6\n(especially GTK3).\n\nDropped Features from Guake 0.8.x\n---------------------------------\n\n- ``--bgimg`` (this option has been removed from vte)\n\nNew Dependencies\n----------------\n\n- ``libkeybinder3``\n\nGuake 3 Features\n----------------\n\n- Lightweight\n- Simple Easy and Elegant\n- Smooth integration of terminal into GUI\n- Appears when you call and disappears once you are done by pressing a predefined hotkey (F12 by\n  default)\n- Compiz transparency support\n- Multi tab\n- Plenty of color palettes\n- Quick Open in your favorite text editor with a click on a file name (with line number support)\n- Customizable hotkeys for tab access, reorganization, background transparency, font size,...\n- Extremely configurable\n- Configure Guake startup by running a bash script when Guake starts\n- Multi-monitor support (open on a specified monitor, open on mouse monitor)\n- Save terminal content to file\n- Open URL to your browser\n\nBugs? Information?\n------------------\n\nSource Code available at: https://github.com/Guake/guake/\n\nOfficial Homepage: http://guake-project.org\n\n**Important note**: Do **NOT** use the domain guake.org, it has been registered by someone outside\nthe team.

You may need to adapt all the\nintegration scripts accordingly.\n\nGuake now uses `Pipfile` to store it Python dependencies (except the system dependencies such as\nPyGTK3). It is maintained and used by `pipenv` CLI tool. It is a system more advanced than using\n`requirements.txt`, but this file is still generated for backward compatibility (for example:\nReadTheDocs only support `requirements.txt` for the moment), by a tool I've developed, named\n`pipenv_to_requirements` (makefile target `make requirements`).\nIt does generate `requirements.txt` (running dependencies), and `requirements-dev.txt` (build,\nchecks and test only). From then, Guake is now a classic, canon Python package (with setup.py,\nbuilding distrubution packages, ...).\n\nIt however requires system libraries, so cannot work isolated inside a virtualenv. If you look\ncloser to the virtualenv used with `make dev ; make run`, you will see it is configured to use\nthe system libraries using `pew toggleglobalsitepackages`.\n\nIf for any reason `pipenv` does not work on your platform, you can still install guake from these\nrequirements file, but the ultimate source of truth for dependency declaration is the `Pipfile`.\n\nDo not hesitate to contact me at `gaetan [at] xeberon.net`.\n\n\nContributing\n============\n\nInstall System dependencies\n---------------------------\n\nUbuntu\n~~~~~~\n\nExecute the following command to bootstrap all needed system dependencies:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ ./bootstrap-debian.sh\n\nSetup development env\n---------------------\n\nInstall the dependencies of your system and use the following commands:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ make dev\n    $ sudo make install-schemas  # still required even for local execution\n\nLocal execution of guake (without system-wide install):\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ make run\n\nGit hook\n~~~~~~~~\n\nPlease install this git hook if you want to beautify your patch before submission:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ make setup-githook\n\nValidate your code\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWe are strict on code styling, with pep8 and pylint running automatically in travis in\norder to reject badly shaped patches. Please use the following command to validate all\npython files:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ make style  # fix the style of python files\n    $ make check  # static code analysis\n    $ make test   # unit test campaign\n    $ make dists  # make distribution packages\n\nUpdate translation\n------------------\n\nUpdate all translation files:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ make update-po\n\nInstall the translations files:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ sudo make install-locale\n\nThen use your favorite po editor, such as ``poedit``.\n\nUpdate NEWS\n-----------\n\nUpdate the `NEWS` file using the followng command:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    make release-note-news\n\n\nThe ``ChangeLog`` files is not maintained but instead automatically generated by PBR when\nbuilding the distribution packages.\n\nSame goes for the `ChangeLog` file.\n\nVersionning\n-----------\n\nVersioning is automatically done using git tags. When a semver tag is pushed, a new version\nis automatically created by PBR.\n\nTravis build\n------------\n\nTravis automatically check pull requests are compiling and check for code style.\n\nStatus of the master branch: https://travis-ci.org/Guake/guake.png?branch=master\n\n\n\n",
