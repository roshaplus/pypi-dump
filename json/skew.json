    "description": "skew\n====\n\n|Build Status|\n\n|Code Health|\n\n| **Skew** is a package for identifying and enumerating cloud resources.\n| The name is a homonym for SKU (Stock Keeping Unit). Skew allows you to\n| define different SKU ``schemes`` which are a particular encoding of a\n| SKU. Skew then allows you to use this scheme pattern and regular\n  expressions\n| based on the scheme pattern to identify and enumerate a resource or\n  set\n| of resources.\n\n| At the moment, the the only available ``scheme`` is the ``ARN``\n  scheme.\n| The ``ARN`` scheme uses the basic structure of\n| `Amazon Resource\n  Names <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__\n  (ARNs) to assign a unique identifier to every AWS\n| resource.\n\nAn example ARN pattern would be:\n\n::\n\n    arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-12345678\n\n| This pattern identifies a specific EC2 instance running in the\n  ``us-west-2``\n| region under the account ID ``123456789012``. The account ID is the\n  12-digit\n| unique identifier for a specific AWS account as described\n| `here <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.html>`__.\nTo allow **skew** to find your account number, you need to create a **skew**\nYAML config file.  By default, **skew** will look for your config file in\n``~/.skew`` but you can use the ``SKEW_CONFIG`` environment variable to tell *skew*\nwhere to find your config file if you choose to put it somewhere else.  The\nbasic format of the *skew* config file is:\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n    ---\n      accounts:\n        \"123456789012\":\n          profile: dev\n        \"234567890123\":\n          profile: prod\n\nWithin the ``accounts`` section, you create keys named after your 12-digit\naccount ID (as a string).  Within that, you must have an entry called *profile*\nthat lists the profile name this account maps to within your AWS credential\nfile.\n          \n\n| The main purpose of skew is to identify resources or sets of resources\n| across services, regions, and accounts and to quickly and easily\n  return the\n| data associated with those resources. For example, if you wanted to\n  return\n| the data associated with the example ARN above:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from skew import scan\n\n    arn = scan('arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-12345678')\n    for resource in arn:\n        print(resource.data)\n\n| The call to ``scan`` returns an ARN object which implements the\n| `iterator\n  pattern <https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#iterator-types>`__\n| and returns a ``Resource`` object for each AWS resource that matches\n  the\n| ARN pattern provided. The ``Resource`` object contains all of the data\n| associated with the AWS resource in dictionary under the ``data``\n  attribute.\n\n| Any of the elements of the ARN can be replaced with a regular\n  expression.\n| The simplest regular expression is ``*`` which means all available\n  choices.\n| So, for example:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    arn = scan('arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:*:instance/*')\n\n| would return an iterator for all EC2 instances in the ``us-east-1``\n  region\n| found in all accounts defined in the config file.\n\n| To find all DynamoDB tables in all US regions for the account ID\n  234567890123\n| you would use:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    arn = scan('arn:aws:dynamodb:us-.*:234567890123:table/*')\n\nCloudWatch Metrics\n------------------\n\n| In addition to making the metadata about a particular AWS resource\n  available\n| to you, ``skew`` also tries to make it easy to access the available\n  CloudWatch\n| metrics for a given resource.\n\n| For example, assume that you had did a ``scan`` on the original ARN\n  above\n| and had the resource associated with that instance available as the\n  variable\n| ``instance``. You could do the following:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> instance.metric_names\n    ['CPUUtilization',\n     'NetworkOut',\n     'StatusCheckFailed',\n     'StatusCheckFailed_System',\n     'NetworkIn',\n     'DiskWriteOps',\n     'DiskReadBytes',\n     'DiskReadOps',\n     'StatusCheckFailed_Instance',\n     'DiskWriteBytes']\n    >>>\n\n| The ``metric_names`` attribute returns the list of available\n  CloudWatch metrics\n| for this resource. The retrieve the metric data for one of these:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> instance.get_metric_data('CPUUtilization')\n    [{'Average': 0.134, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T14:04:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {'Average': 0.066, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:54:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {'Average': 0.066, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T14:09:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {'Average': 0.134, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:34:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {'Average': 0.066, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T14:19:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {'Average': 0.068, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:44:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {'Average': 0.134, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T14:14:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {'Average': 0.066, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:29:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {'Average': 0.132, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:59:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {'Average': 0.134, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:49:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {'Average': 0.134, 'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:39:00Z', 'Unit': 'Percent'}]\n    >>>\n\nYou can also customize the data returned rather than using the default\nsettings:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> instance.get_metric_data('CPUUtilization', hours=8, statistics=['Average', 'Minimum', 'Maximum'])\n    [{'Average': 0.132,\n      'Maximum': 0.33,\n      'Minimum': 0.0,\n      'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T10:54:00Z',\n      'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {'Average': 0.134,\n      'Maximum': 0.34,\n      'Minimum': 0.0,\n      'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T14:04:00Z',\n      'Unit': 'Percent'},\n      ...,\n     {'Average': 0.066,\n      'Maximum': 0.33,\n      'Minimum': 0.0,\n      'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T08:34:00Z',\n      'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {'Average': 0.134,\n      'Maximum': 0.34,\n      'Minimum': 0.0,\n      'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T08:04:00Z',\n      'Unit': 'Percent'}]\n    >>>\n\nFiltering Data\n--------------\n\n| Each resource that is retrieved is a Python dictionary. Some of these\n  (e.g.\n| an EC2 Instance) can be quite large and complex. Skew allows you to\n  filter\n| the data returned by applying a `jmespath <http://jmespath.org>`__\n  query to\n| the resulting data. If you aren't familiar with jmespath, check it\n  out.\n| Its a very powerful query language for JSON data and has full support\n  in\n| Python as well as a number of other languages such as Ruby, PHP, and\n| Javascript. It is also the query language used in the\n| `AWSCLI <https://aws.amazon.com/cli/>`__ so if you are familiar with\n  the\n| ``--query`` option there, you can use the same thing with skew.\n\n| To specify a query to be applied to results of a scan, simply append\n| the query to the end of the ARN, separated by a ``|`` (pipe)\n  character.\n| For example:\n\n::\n\n    arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-12345678|InstanceType\n\n| Would retrieve the data for this particular EC2 instance and would\n  then\n| filter the returned data through the (very) simple jmespath query to\n  which\n| retrieves the value of the attribute ``InstanceType`` within the data.\n  The\n| filtered data is available as the ``filtered_data`` attribute of the\n| Resource object. The full, unfiltered data is still available as the\n| ``data`` attribute.\n\nMore Examples\n-------------\n\n`Find Unattached\nVolumes <https://gist.github.com/garnaat/73804a6b0bd506ee6075>`__\n\n`Audit Security\nGroups <https://gist.github.com/garnaat/4123f1aefe7d65df9b48>`__\n\n`Find Untagged\nInstances <https://gist.github.com/garnaat/11004f5661b4798d27c7>`__\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/scopely-devops/skew.svg?branch=develop\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/scopely-devops/skew\n.. |Code Health| image:: https://landscape.io/github/scopely-devops/skew/develop/landscape.png\n   :target: https://landscape.io/github/scopely-devops/skew/develop",
