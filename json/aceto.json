    "description": "Accelerated Charge and Energy Transfer Objects (ACETO) library\n \nContains Fortran (2003) routines for some common tasks in quantum theory of molecular charge\nand energy transfer. \n\nPreferred pronounciation of the library's abbreviation is the Italian one. ACETO means vinegar\nin Italian. The library is designed to add some extra flavour to another project, the Python\nopen quantum system theory package Quantarhei (see http://github.com/tmancal74/quantarhei).\n\n\nHOW TO INSTALL ACETO\n--------------------\n\nAceto can be installed on Linux and Mac\n\nInstallation from source:\n\nOne way of installing is by downloading source code from github.com. You need\nto configur the Makefile by changing the content of the 'conf/conf.in' file to point to\na file containing gcc flags (gcc_linux.in and gcc_mac.in files are tested). Of course\nyour system has to have gcc compiler istalled. Then you\nneed to create a 'lib' directory in your home directory. This is a temporal \nfix, but right now, shared library 'libaceto.so' is \"installed\" locally this way.\nThen you need to issue\n\n> make\n> make install\n\nseries of commnads. You will be asked to confirm that a shared library that was\ncreated in the 'lib' subdirectory can be copied to the 'lib' directory in your \nhome directory.\n\nBinary installation:\n\nThe installation procedure of Aceto is still in development. Currently we\nprovide binary distribution for macOS and Linux compiled with gcc complilers\nthrough a Python egg awailable from PyPa via the 'easy_install' command. Typing\n\n> easy_install aceto\n\nwill instal aceto, but in order for it to run correctly, you have to go to the\ndirectory whete aceto is installed (this informatio is displayed during\ninstallation by 'easy_install') and type\n\n> python postinstall.py\n\nYou will be asked to confirm that the 'libaceto.so' file can be moved to the\ndirectory 'lib' in your home directory. If this directory is not present, you\nhave to create it.\n\n\nLinux specific:\n\nOn Linux it seems that LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable set in qrhei script which is\nused to run the quantarhei input files (as a subprocess) does not influence the setting for\nthe subprocess. The solution is to export the LD_LIBRARY_PATH in something like\n.bashrc to point to the ${HOME}/lib directory.",
