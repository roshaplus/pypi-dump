    "description": "===================================\nDocker Platform Engine for Topology\n===================================\n\nDocker based Platform Engine plugin for the Network Topology Framework.\n\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\n    http://topology-docker.rtfd.org/\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.6.0\n-----\n\n**New**\n\n- A *dockerfile* for a test host container has been added. The purpose of this\n  container is to serve as a general purpose test host, which includes by\n  default several tools (iperf, tcpdump, for example) that are useful for test\n  case execution.\n- Fixing default host image in ``ubuntu:14.04``. The default image for hosts\n  used to be ``ubuntu:latest`` but since the actual image to which this points\n  to can change, it could introduce issues for test cases that were developed\n  under the assumption that the pointed-to image included the necessary tools\n  for the test case.\n- Logging the image and container data. Image name, id, creation date, etc. are\n  now logged automatically for every container.\n- Docker nodes now mount their ``/tmp`` directory under the host ``/tmp``. The\n  mount path of this directory under the host ``/tmp`` is defined using the\n  container ``id``.\n- A new test that checks the proper functionality of host routes has been\n  added. This is a functional test in which 2 hosts ping each other.\n\n**Changes**\n\n- Documentation for ``image`` attribute has been improved. This attribute was a\n  source of confusion since it was not explicitly documented that the ``TAG``\n  column needed to be included in the ``image`` value.\n\n**Fixes**\n\n- Nodes which fail to start are now not considered for rollback. Also, this\n  rollback process is now a *best effort* since it just tries to stop nodes. If\n  one of these nodes fails to stop, this will be logged and the process will\n  continue.\n\n1.5.0\n-----\n\n**Changes**\n\nThe only change in this version is the transference of all specialized support\nnodes previously included with this platform engine into their own repositories.\nThis change seeks to improve maintainability of the platform engine, separation\nof the support nodes issues, requirements and enhancements from those of the\nplatform and, finally, endorse shared ownership of the nodes.\n\nThe new home for those support nodes are:\n\n:OpenSwitch support node:\n https://github.com/HPENetworking/topology_docker_openswitch\n\n:Open vSwitch support node:\n https://github.com/HPENetworking/topology_docker_openvswitch\n\n:P4Switch support node:\n https://github.com/HPENetworking/topology_docker_p4switch\n\n:Ryu Controller support node:\n https://github.com/HPENetworking/topology_docker_ryu\n\n\n1.4.0\n-----\n\n**New**\n\n- The ``binds`` attribute can now be injected and extended by users. If you\n  require to add a new bind directory to a node you may now specify the\n  attribute ``binds`` (and thus, also use attribute injection) separating the\n  pair of binded directories with a ``;``. For example::\n\n      /host/a:/container/a;/host/b:/container/b\n\n- OpenSwitch support node will now notify the container when the setup of the\n  interfaces is done. This fixes many potential race conditions on container\n  initialization. To be able to use this new feature an OpenSwitch image of a\n  date greater than March 4 2016 is required.\n\n**Changes**\n\n- Set ``topology`` minimal version to ``1.5.0``.\n- Internal ``docker exec`` shell layer migrated to Topology's new shell API,\n  available since 1.4.0 and improved in 1.5.0.\n\n**Fixes**\n\n- OpenSwitch support node will now ignore the ``bonding_masters`` interface\n  when creating setting up the ports.\n- Fixed a race condition in OpenSwitch support node caused by a slower than\n  normal db schema setup in ovsdb. This race conditions caused an ``IndexError``\n  when setting up the image, causing the topology build to rollback.\n\n1.3.0\n-----\n\n**Changes**\n\n- Node's/Container's hostname can now be set using the ``hostname`` attribute\n  in the SZN description. OpenSwitch will always enforce the ``switch``\n  hostname for all nodes of this type.\n- Docker-py's will now use the server's API version, instead of the latest.\n  With this it will no longer required to update the Docker daemon to run\n  topology tests.\n- Set ``topology`` minimal version to ``1.2.0``.\n\n1.2.0\n-----\n\n**Changes**\n\n- Refactored node loading logic to use ``topology.platforms.utils.NodeLoader``\n  instead.\n\n1.1.0\n-----\n\n**New**\n\n- Added Dockerfiles for Ryu and P4.\n\n**Changes**\n\n- The Open vSwitch node will now check that the ``openvswitch`` kernel module\n  is loaded. It is supposed to work in user space, but we discovered many race\n  conditions without the kernel module.\n  Check the documentation of the ``openvswitch`` node for more information.\n\n**Fixes**\n\n- Improved openswitch's vtysh prompt regular expression to avoid false\n  positives matches.\n- Fixed a bug on shell management that caused the echo of the command to be\n  included in the output, and thus interpreted as failed.\n\n1.0.0\n-----\n\n- Initial public release.\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n::\n\n   Copyright (C) 2015-2016 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing,\n   software distributed under the License is distributed on an\n   \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\n   KIND, either express or implied.
