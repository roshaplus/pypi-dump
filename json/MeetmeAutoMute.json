    "description": "MeetmeAutoMute is a utility for Asterisk that can automatically mute\r\nparticipants in a Meetme conference. This can be handy for when you are using\r\nthe conference to broadcast some audio (like during... a speech or presentation,\r\nand do not want to have people interfere with the speaker. It is written in\r\nPython and uses the AMI through the \"pyst\" library\r\n(http://pyst.sourceforge.net/). Everything is configurable through a config\r\nfile, and can be controled at run time through the use of \"signals\". I have also\r\nincluded an \"init.d\" style bash script that can be used for starting, stopping\r\nand reloaded the config file. The script will start the app as a background daemon.",
