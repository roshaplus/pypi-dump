It provides a collection of hydro-packages, each of them dealing with a specific issue of the field.\nThe main goal is to speed up both algorithms testing and research-2-operation.\n\nThe BAG hydro-package collects tools for working with BAG files. BAG is a data format by the `ONS-WG <http://www.opennavsurf.org/>`_ (Open Navigation Surface Working Group).\n\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nFor the BAG library, you will need:\n\n* ``python`` *[>=3.5]*\n* ``numpy``\n* ``h5py``\n* ``lxml``\n* ``gdal``\n* ``PyInstaller`` *[for freezing the tools]*\n\nFor running some of the example scripts, you might also need:\n\n* ``matplotlib``\n\n\nOther info\n----------\n\n* Bitbucket: `https://bitbucket.org/ccomjhc/hyo_bag <https://bitbucket.org/ccomjhc/hyo_bag>`_\n* Project page: `http://www.hydroffice.org <http://www.hydroffice.org>`_\n* License: LGPLv3 license (See `LICENSE <https://bitbucket.org/ccomjhc/hyo_bag/raw/tip/LICENSE>`_)\n\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n0.5\n~~~\n\n2017-04-21\n\n- Switch to Python 3\n\n\n0.2\n~~~\n\n2016-05-27\n\n- Added option to read a slice of rows for elevation and uncertainty layers\n\n2016-03-21\n\n- Added option to reproject layers into user-defined EPSG\n\n\n2015-10-24\n\n- Split BAG Explorer as stand-alone hydro-package\n\n\n2015-10-09\n\n- Added BAG Explorer\n- Started Schematron schema for BAG Metadata profile\n\n\n0.1\n~~~\n\n2015-03-31\n\n- Initial commit.\n\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\nHydrOffice BAG is written and maintained by:\n\n- `Giuseppe Masetti <mailto:gmasetti@ccom.unh.edu>`_\n\n- `Brian Calder <mailto:brc@ccom.unh.edu>`_\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe following wonderful people contributed directly or indirectly to this project:\n\n- `Matt Wilson <mailto:matt.wilson@noaa.gov>`_\n\nPlease add yourself here alphabetically when you submit your first pull request.\n\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nHow to contribute\n=================\n\nEvery open source project lives from the generous help by contributors that sacrifice their time and this is no different.\n\nTo make participation as pleasant as possible, this project adheres to the `Code of Conduct`_ by the Python Software Foundation.\n\nHere are a few hints and rules to get you started:\n\n- Add yourself to the AUTHORS.txt_ file in an alphabetical fashion. Every contribution is valuable and shall be credited.\n- If your change is noteworthy, add an entry to the changelog_.\n- No contribution is too small; please submit as many fixes for typos and grammar bloopers as you can!\n- Don't *ever* break backward compatibility.\n- *Always* add tests and docs for your code. This is a hard rule; patches with missing tests or documentation won't be merged.\n  If a feature is not tested or documented, it does not exist.\n- Obey `PEP 8`_ and `PEP 257`_.\n- Write `good commit messages`_.\n- Ideally, `collapse`_ your commits, i.e. make your pull requests just one commit.\n\n.. note::\n   If you have something great but aren't sure whether it adheres -- or even can adhere -- to the rules above: **please submit a pull request anyway**!\n   In the best case, we can mold it into something, in the worst case the pull request gets politely closed.\n   There's absolutely nothing to fear.\n\nThank you for considering to contribute! If you have any question or concerns, feel free to reach out to us.\n\n.. _`Code of Conduct`: http://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/\n.. _AUTHORS.txt: https://bitbucket.org/ccomjhc/hyo_bag/raw/tip/AUTHORS.rst\n.. _changelog: https://bitbucket.org/ccomjhc/hyo_bag/raw/tip/HISTORY.rst\n.. _`PEP 8`: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\n.. _`PEP 257`: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/\n.. _collapse: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/RebaseExtension\n.. _`good commit messages`: http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html\n",
