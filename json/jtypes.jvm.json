    "description": "jtypes.jvm\n==========\n\nPure Python Java package\n\nOverview\n========\n\njtypes.jvm is a bridge between Python and Java JVM, allowing these to intercommunicate.\nIt is an effort to allow python programs full access to Java class libraries.\n\njtypes.jvm is a lightweight Python Java package, based on the ctypes FFI library.\nIt is a fork of Steve Menard's good known JPype package by reimplementing whole it's\nfunctionality in a clean Python instead of C/C++.\n\n\nWhat is jtypes.jvm:\n-------------------\n\njtypes.jvm is an effort to allow python programs full access to Java class libraries.\nThis is achieved not through re-implementing Python, as Jython/JPython has done,\nbut rather through interfacing at the native level in both virtual machines.\n\nEventually, it should be possible to replace Java with python in many, though not all, situations.\nJSP, Servlets, RMI servers and IDE plugins are good candidates.\n\nOnce this integration is achieved, a second phase will be started to separate the Java logic from\nthe Python logic, eventually allowing the bridging technology to be used in other environments,\nI.E. Ruby, Perl, COM, etc ...\n\n\nKnown Bugs/Limitations :\n    * Java classes outside of a package (in the <default>) cannot be imported.\n    * Because of lack of JVM support, you cannot shutdown the JVM and then restart it.\n    * Some methods rely on the \"current\" class/caller. Since calls coming directly from\n      python code do not have a current class, these methods do not work. The User Manual\n      lists all the known methods like that.\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nIf you need assistance, you can ask for help on our mailing list:\n\n* User Group : https://groups.google.com/group/kivy-users\n* Email      : kivy-users@googlegroups.com\n\nWe also have an IRC channel:\n\n* Server  : irc.freenode.net\n* Port    : 6667, 6697 (SSL only)\n* Channel : #kivy\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n::\n\n    pip install --upgrade jtypes.jvm\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n+ Python 2.7 or higher or 3.3 or higher\n\n  * http://www.python.org/\n  * Versions lower than 2.7 or lower than 3.3 WON'T WORK.\n  * 2.7 and 3.4 are primary test environments.\n\n+ pip or setuptools\n\n  * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip\n  * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n  | Copyright (c) 2004 - 2016 Adam Karpierz\n  |\n  | Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0\n  | http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n  | Please refer to the LICENSE file.\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\n* Adam Karpierz <python@python.pl>\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n0.1.1 (2005-10-05)\n------------------\n   - Initial version.",
