This means by default even the task is not finished you could set it as invoiceable.\n\nAs an option you can relate to a Proyect Stage ( ``project.task.type`` ) this control. For example if you want to assign Invoiceable to stage ``Done`` always\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo use this module, you need to:\n\n1. Go to Sales -> Product and create a service product\n\n2.
