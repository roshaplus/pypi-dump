    "description": "WS2801python_rpi\n================\n\nA python module connecting RPI with WS2801\n------------------------------------------\n\n**This is version 1.0.0.dev2. It is in development. Code may change\nwithout notice.**\n\nIt is based on the spidev module you can find\n`here <https://github.com/doceme/py-spidev>`__.\n\nYou can use it like this:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import WS2801_RPI as w\n    s=w.set_led_colors_buffer_list_multi_call\n    w.set_number_of_leds(100)                      # adjust to the number of leds in your project\n    w.s(1)                                         # to let led number 1 shine in white\n    w.flush()                                      # to communicate your settings to the led strip via spi\n\nYou can call set_leds as often as you like before flushing it out. And\nof course you can flush as often as you need to create effects.\n\nOther convenience functions are:\n--------------------------------\n\n-  ``clear()``: turn off all leds. Remember you need to call ``flush()``\n   to see the effect.\n-  ``get_led_colors_buffer_dict()``: Get all rgb values currently in the\n   buffer as dictionary. This might differ from what you see on your LED\n   strip.\n-  ``set_led_colors_buffer_dict_multi_call()``: After you adjusted the\n   dict of the function above: Write it back to the buffer. Don\u2019t forget\n   ``flush()``.\n-  ``set_max_speed_hz(hz)``: Default is 1MHz. You may change this but\n   not below 1,5KHz.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nI have not managed to upload to pypi so far. Therefore only way to\ninstall is: use ``python setup.py install`` in the download directory.\nOr simply put ``WS2801_RPI`` into the folder where you like to do your\npython programming.\n\nHint\n----\n\nYou can raise the log level if you like to suppress warnings, like\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import logging\n    logging.getLogger().setLevel(31)\n\nGeneral remarks on WS2801:\n--------------------------\n\n-  In the Data\n   `Sheet <https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2801.pdf>`__ of\n   WS2801 I found the following passage I didn\u2019t fully understand:\n   ``When the WS2801 receives total 24 clock rising edges, the WS2801 enters relay mode ...``.\n   Nevertheless I send now 24 times 1 [255,255,255] before sending the\n   RGB data for the LEDs and have much better results.\n-  WS2801 is using the raising flag of the clock to retrieve the data\n   and expects clock being low for 500 microseconds between data\n   transmissions. Hence there is no need to chance the mode of spidev.\n   It must be zero, regardless which effects you see.\n\nWould be glad if this code was used often in your projects. Feedback and pull requests are more than welcome.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n",
