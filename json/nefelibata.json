    "description": "Nefelibata\n==========\n\n\"Nefelibata\" is a weblog engine that is based on these principles:\n\n1. Published content should be on static files. If you need interaction, there's\n   Javascript for that. \n\n2. The Unix filesystem is more than proved. Databases are an overkill for a \n   blogging platform where you write once every few hours, maximum.\n\n3. ASCII files are important for long-term archival.\n\nThese principles led to the design where HTML pages are built from ASCII files\nholding the posts using Markdown. The pages are then published to S3. There are\nno servers and no databases, only static ASCII files in the filesystem.\n\n\"Nefelibata\" is a portuguese word derived from \"nephele\" (cloud) and \"batha\"\n(where you can walk), meaning \"one who walks on clouds\".\n\n\n.. This is your project NEWS file which will contain the release notes.\n.. Example: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6/NEWS.txt\n.. The content of this file, along with README.rst, will appear in your\n.. project's PyPI page.\n\nNews\n====\n\n0.2a1\n-----\n\n*Release date: UNRELEASED*\n\n* Example news entry for the in-development version\n\n\n0.1\n---\n\n*Release date: 15-Mar-2010*\n\n* Example news entry for a released version",
