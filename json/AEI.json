    "description": "==========\nAEI Readme\n==========\n\nThis package provides a specification for the Arimaa Engine Interface (AEI).\nIt also includes some tools for using engines that implement AEI. Including an\ninterface to the arimaa.com gameroom. A full description of AEI can be found in\nthe file ``aei-protocol.txt``.\n\nThe scripts included for working with an AEI engine are:\n\n``analyze``\n  A simple script that runs an engine and has it search a given position or\n  move sequence.\n``gameroom``\n  AEI controller that connects to the arimaa.com gameroom and plays a game.\n``postal_controller``\n  Keeps a bot making moves as needed in any postal games it is a participant\n  in.\n``roundrobin``\n  Plays engines against each other in a round robin tournament.\n``simple_engine``\n  Very basic AEI engine, just plays random step moves.\n\nBasic examples of using the scripts can be found in the file ``usage.rst``.\n\nThe pyrimaa package also includes modules implementing the controller side of\nthe AEI protocol (``aei.py``), the Arimaa position representation (as bitboards\nin ``board.py`` and x88 in ``x88board.py``), and a few utility functions for\nhandling Arimaa timecontrols (``util.py``).\n\nIf you have python2 and pip on your machine you can install the latest\nrelease with::\n\n    pip install aei\n\nOn an operating system with a system supplied python you probably want to keep\nthe aei install separate from your system installed packages. To accomplish\nthat you can use either a virtualenv or user install.  A user install is done\nsimply by adding the ``--user`` option::\n\n    pip install --user aei",
