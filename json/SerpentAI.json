Turn ANY video game you own\ninto a sandbox environment ripe for experimentation, all with familiar\nPython code. The framework's *raison d'\u00eatre* is first and foremost to\nprovide a valuable tool for Machine Learning & AI research. It also\nturns out to be ridiculously fun to use as a hobbyist (and dangerously\naddictive; a fair warning)!\n\nThe framework features a large assortment of supporting modules that\nprovide solutions to commonly encountered scenarios when using video\ngames as environments as well as CLI tools to accelerate development. It\nprovides some useful conventions but is absolutely NOT opiniated about\nwhat you put in your agents: Want to use the latest, cutting-edge deep\nreinforcement learning algorithm? ALLOWED. Want to use computer vision\ntechniques, image processing and trigonometry? ALLOWED. Want to randomly\npress the Left or Right buttons? *sigh* ALLOWED. To top it all off,\nSerpent.AI was designed to be entirely plugin-based (for both game\nsupport and game agents) so your experiments are actually portable and\ndistributable to your peers and random strangers on the Internet.\n\nYou'll also be glad to hear that all 3 major OSes are supported: Linux,\nWindows & macOS. *Note: Early support for macOS. WIP*\n\n.. figure:: https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/serpent-ai-assets/demo_isaac.gif\n   :alt: \n\n*Experiment: Game agent learning to defeat Monstro (The Binding of\nIsaac: Afterbirth+)*\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe project was born out of admiration for / frustration with `OpenAI\nUniverse <https://github.com/openai/universe>`__. The idea is perfect,\nlet's be honest, but some implementation details leave a lot to be\ndesired. From these, the core tennets of the framework were established:\n\n1. Thou shall run natively. Thou shalt not use Docker containers or VNC\n   servers.\n2. Thou shall allow a user to bring their own games. Thou shalt not wait\n   for licensing deals and special game APIs.\n3. Thou shall encourage diverse and creative approaches. Thou shalt not\n   only enable AI flavors of the month.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nGuides, tutorials and videos are being produced and added to the `GitHub\nWiki <https://github.com/SerpentAI/SerpentAI/wiki>`__. It currently is\nthe official source of documentation.\n\n.. figure:: https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/serpent-ai-assets/demo_ymbab.gif\n   :alt: \n\n*Experiment: Game agent learning to match tiles (You Must Build a\u00a0Boat)*\n\nSerpent.AI is currently in BETA. It it the love child of\n[@nbrochu](https://github.com/nbrochu)'s passion for science &\nexperimentation, programming and video games. All of development and\nexperiments can be seen live on the `Twitch\nChannel <https://www.twitch.tv/serpent_ai>`__.\n\n*Business Contact: info@serpent.ai*\n\n*:sub:`Business` Contact: `Discord\nServer <https://discord.gg/9D5SuxH>`__*\n",
