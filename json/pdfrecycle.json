    "description": "What is pdfrecycle?\n===================\n\npdfrecycle creates a PDF file by composing pages from other PDF\nfiles. It can add PDF bookmarks and metadata, scale, rotate and crop\npages and put multiple logical pages onto each physical sheet.\n\npdfrecycle uses a simple text file format to define the layout and what\npages to include. From this input file pdfrecycle creates a LaTeX\nfile and then runs pdflatex to produced the PDF file.\n\n\nStatus\n======\n\npdfrecycle is alpha software and should be expected to have some\nserious bugs. **Use it at your own risk.**\n\npdfrecycle is still under development and the input file format may change\nin the future.\n\nAny feedback, suggestions or bugreports are welcome.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\npdfrecycle needs\n\n- Python\n- `PyPdf <http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/>`__.\n  `easy-install <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`__\n  will install this automatically\n- a working LaTeX installation including pdflatex, hyperref and  pdfpages\n\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nSee http://www.florian-diesch.de/software/pdfrecycle/doc/",
