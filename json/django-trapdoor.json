Clone the project.\n\n  ```bash\n  pip install django-trapdoor.git\n  ```\n\n2. Add ``trapdoor`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` array in your **settings.py** file.\n\n3. Add the following lines of code to your ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` array in your **settings.py** file.\n\n  ```python\n  MIDDLEWARE = [\n    ...\n    'trapdoor.middleware.TrapdoorMiddleware',\n    ...\n  ]\n  ```\n\n4. Update your database by running the following in your console\n\n  ```bash\n  python manage.py migrate\n  ```\n\n## Usage\n### Operation\nOnce you enable the ``TrapdoorMiddleware`` middleware in your django app, every GET request gets analyzed as follows:\n\n1. Lookup the users real IP address and confirm it\u2019s not blocked, if blocked a ``403`` error gets returned to the user.\n2. Else if real IP address is not blocked, check to see if the requested URL path is considered [suspicious](https://github.com/MikaSoftware/django-trapdoor/blob/master/trapdoor/constants.py) and if the path is then block immediately.\n3. Else if request URL path is not suspicious then do nothing\n\nIf you would like to know the IP address of the request then use the ``request.trapdoor`` variable in your code.\n\nThis library also integrates with ``django-admin`` and thus you can further control removing/adding IP address to ban there.\n\n### Command Line\n#### ban_ip\nThis command will add an IP address to ban.\n\n#### remove_banned_ip\nThis command is to be used to remove a specific IP address that you feel no longer should be banned from your django website.\n\n#### remove_banned_ips_older_then_by_days\nThis command is used to remove banned ips which are older then a certain day count. This is a command useful for if you want to run a ``cronjob`` or ``background process`` to run periodically and remove banned IPs that are older then a certain day count.\n\n#### print_banned_ips\nThis command will print to the console all the IP addresses that where banned.\n\n### Environment Settings Variables\n#### TRAPDOOR_DO_NOT_BAN_IP_ADDRESSES\nThis is an array of IP addresses which will not get banned if they lookup suspicious paths. This is a useful variable to set if you plan on performing your own security audit or have a third party perform a security audit without getting banned.\n\n#### TRAPDOOR_EXTRA_SUSPICIOUS_PATHS\nThis is an array of URL paths which can be added by yourself as extra paths to be used for blocking criteria. This is a useful variable if you find this libray missing a path that should be blocked.\n\n## Contributing\nIf you have a *suspicious URL path* you would like to add, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/MikaSoftware/django-trapdoor/issues/new) and we will add it in! If you are a **developer** who feels you can improve this library, please do! We have written a [contributing](https://github.com/MikaSoftware/django-trapdoor/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document to help you get started.\n\n## License\nThis library is licensed under the **BSD** license. See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for more information.\n\n## Common Issues\nIf you get self banned for whatever reason, this means your ``nginx``, ``apache`` or whatever web-server you are using is not properly configured.\n\n\n",
