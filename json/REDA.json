    "description": "## REDA - Reproducible Electrical Data Analysis\n\nREDA is a scientific Python library for reproducible geoelectrical data analysis. It aims to provide a unified interface for common and advanced data processing steps while bridging the gap between a multitude of geoelectric measurement devices and inversion codes used across the geophysical community. It offers functionality to import, analyze, process, visualize, and export geoelectrical data with particular emphasis on time-lapse functionality and reproducibility. The latter is realized in the form of a logging system, which keeps track of each individual processing step applied to particular data set in a human-readable journal. REDA is platform compatible, tested and open-source under the permissive MIT license. Any contributions from the community are highly welcome.\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/ubonn-geophysics/reda\ncd reda\n\n# 1) Installing dependencies with pip\npip install -r requirements.txt\n# 2) Installing dependencies with conda\nconda install --file requirements.txt\n\npython setup.py install\n```\n\n<!--\nElectrical geophysical data is increasingly measured in time-lapse setups,\nwhich leads, in addition to the common use of multi-channel systems which are\ncapable of capturing the full time-series of either time-domain or frequency\ndomain systems, to a large number of datasets. These datasets are to be\nanalyzed with respect to various properties. These are, among others, outlier\ndetection, normal-reciprocal analysis for error estimation and quality control,\nand coupling effects.\n\nWhile electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) measures real transfer\nresistances using a large number of four-point spreads, tomographic IP\nmeasurements additionally capture the induced polarization (IP) effect in terms\nof a decay curve. Measurements in the frequency domain capture the resistance\nand polarizability for a wide range of frequencies, thereby capturing spectral\ninduced polarization (SIP) signatures. When SIP signatures are recorded at a\nlarge number of different electrode configurations with the aim of a tomography\nanalysis, the method is often referred to as electrical impedance tomography\n(EIT). Hereby some ambiguity exists, as EIT can refer to tomographic\nmeasurements of the complex impedance (resistance plus polarization) in the\nfrequency domain for only one frequency or for a whole frequency range.\nSometimes multi-frequency measurements are thus referred to as sEIT\nmeasurements (spectral electrical impedance tomography).\n\nThe dimensionality of the data that is nowadays captures increases steadily,\nwith new dimensions being measurement frequency, time step in a time-lapse\nmonitoring setup and third dimension. This requires the adaptation of existing\nand new analysis procedures to these N-dimensional datasets. Established\nprocedures are hereby commonly based on plain text files or 2-dimensional data array\nrepresentations (e.g., Matlab matrices, columns denote electrode positions and\nmeasurements, row denote measurements at various four-point spreads). Here, new\napproaches are required to keep data analysis efforts at similar levels,\ncompared to \"established\" work flows. Luckily, the last years have seen the\nemergence of suitable, free, and advanced (Python) libraries that can be used\nwithout much adaptation for these purposes. The pandas DataFrame object allows\nthe storage and manipulation of N-dimensional datasets. We here propose to\nbuild a framework for the import, storage, and modification of geoelectrical\ndatasets based upon this established tool, and amend it with domain-specific\nfunctionality and handling instructions.\n\nAll these different types of electrical measurements have certain features in\ncommon, and certain specific properties, which also leads to some common\nanalysis/display procedures, and some specialized ones.\n\nThis software package aims at providing the following programmatical structures\nand procedures:\n\n-   provide a pure-Python implementation of data structures that can hold the\n    various datasets described above.\n\n-   provide a tested set of import functions for the common measurement device\n    formats\n\n-   provide a tested set of output functions which export to common analysis\n    software such as tomographic inversion packages.\n\n-   provide a Python based software framework for the general analysis of\n    electrical raw measurement data. We refer to waw measurement data as the data\n    produced by the geoeletrical measurement devices before any kind of\n    transformation such as tomographic analysis.\n\n    A history is provided for common data selection (i.e., filtering) procedures,\n    which provides a means to later account for all changes applied to the raw data\n    (i.e., providing reproducibility of the data filtering process).\n\n-   Provide ground work for text-based output formats that could be used for\n    archiving purposes. However, defining and maintaining suitable file formats\n    for the long-term storage of measurement data is a huge and complex task.\n    Therefore, the data formats presented here are meant only as a starting base\n    for the development and discussion of corresponding file formats.\n\n-   Provide open implementations of common features of geoeletrical data\n    processing, such as error model estimations for ERT and sEIT data sets.\n\n-   The software is provided under an open-source licence (GPL-3), to facilitate\n    and encourage contributions from the community\n\n-   Only optional dependencies on external packages\n\n## Work environment\n\nCreate the work environment using the following commands: ::\n\n    mkvirtualenv --python /usr/bin/python3 edf\n    pip install --upgrade pip\n    workon edf\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    pip install ipython\n\n    ipython3\n\n## Roadmap\n\nMilestones for beta versions of the EDF framework.

However, if not all required\n    errors (i.e., only phase, no magnitude errors) are provided, then this must\n    end in all other errors as nan values.\n-   dimensionality should not be a problem if we use a pandas.DataFrame with\n    multiindexing\n\n## Test activities\n\n-   select measurement nr 3\n-   show quadpole nr 2\n-   show all measurements with A=1, B=2, M=4, N=3\n-   plot R of measurement nr 3, quadpole 6\n-   filter all measurements with R &lt; 0.08 Ohm\n\n## Pytables\n\nOn Debian systems:\n\nCFLAGS=\"-I/usr/lib/openmpi/include/\" pip install tables -->",
