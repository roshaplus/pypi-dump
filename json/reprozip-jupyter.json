    "description": "ReproZip\n========\n\n`ReproZip <https://www.reprozip.org/>`__ is a tool aimed at simplifying the process of creating reproducible experiments from command-line executions, a frequently-used common denominator in computational science. It tracks operating system calls and creates a package that contains all the binaries, files and dependencies required to run a given command on the author's computational environment (packing step).  A reviewer can then extract the experiment in his environment to reproduce the results (unpacking step).\n\nreprozip-jupyter\n----------------\n\nThis package provides tracing and reproduction of Jupyter notebooks, allowing one to pack all the libraries and data used in their notebook to allow anyone to re-run it easily.\n\nPlease refer to `reprozip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reprozip>`__ and `reprounzip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reprounzip>`_ for more information.\n\nAdditional Information\n----------------------\n\nFor more detailed information, please refer to our `website <https://www.reprozip.org/>`_, as well as to our `documentation <https://reprozip.readthedocs.io/>`_.\n\nReproZip is currently being developed at `NYU <http://engineering.nyu.edu/>`_. The team includes:\n\n* `Fernando Chirigati <https://vgc.poly.edu/~fchirigati/>`_\n* `Juliana Freire <https://vgc.poly.edu/~juliana/>`_\n* `Remi Rampin <https://remirampin.com/>`_\n* `Dennis Shasha <http://cs.nyu.edu/shasha/>`_\n* `Vicky Steeves <https://vickysteeves.com/>`_",
