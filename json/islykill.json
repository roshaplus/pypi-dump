    "description": "A simple python client for the Icelandic government authentication service \u00cdslykill (www.islykill.is)\r\n        You must apply for access before using this library.\r\n        \r\n        Usage\r\n        =====\r\n        \r\n        Just remember to set the `username`, `password` and `service_id` as your own.\r\n        `service_id` is the ID you are given from the national registry of Iceland (www.skra.is), e.g. for \r\n        www.betraisland.is the id is `betraisland.is` and the \u00cdslykill authentication url is \r\n        `https://innskraning.island.is/?id=betraisland.is`\r\n        \r\n            >>> import islykill\r\n            >>> islykill.username = \"Your-username-here\"\r\n            >>> islykill.password = \"Your-password-here\"\r\n            >>> islykill.service_id = \"dev.roddfolksins.is\"\r\n            >>> token = 'Some-received-token' # the token received from island.is\r\n            >>> ip_address = '1.1.1.1' # remote user ip address\r\n            >>> result = islykill.generate_saml_from_token(token, ip_address)\r\n            >>> print result\r\n            {'ssn': '1234567890', 'ip_address': '1.1.1.1', 'name': u'Jon Jonsson'}\r\n        \r\n        If an error occurs, the result from `generate_saml_from_token` will return a dictionary with the \r\n        key \"error\" with the body of the error as value, e.g.\r\n        \r\n            >>> print result\r\n            {'error': 'HTTPError = 500'}\r\n        \r\n        500 usually mean that you can make the request again immediately, just a glitch in the\r\n        webservice.\r\n        \r\n            >>> print result\r\n            {'error': 'Unable to find SAML assertion from token.'}\r\n        \r\n        \"Unable to find SAML assertion from token\" means that the token is invalid or expired somehow, \r\n        which means the user has to authenticate again.",
