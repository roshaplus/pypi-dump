    "description": "===========\n`medallion`\n===========\n\nNOTE: This is an `OASIS Open Repository <https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/>`_. See the `Governance`_ section for more information.\n\n*medallion* is a minimal implementation of a TAXII 2.0 Server in python.\n\n*medallion* does NOT support the following features of the `TAXII 2.0 specification <http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.0/csprd01/taxii-v2.0-csprd01.html>`_:\n\n- Sorting\n- Pagination\n- Content-Types other than the default\n- Pending Add Objects responses (all Add Objects request process all objects before sending back a response)\n\nAlthough *medallion* conforms to most of the `interoperability specification <https://docs.google.com/document/d/11MocPK3s8im8O5-7rgZhtVHoxO72aQicJj2v-HDx-Q8/>`_,\n**it should not be used in a production environment**.\nIts main purpose is for use in testing scenarios of STIX-based applications that use the `python-stix2 API <https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-python-stix2>`_.  It has been developed in conjunction\nwith `cti-taxii-client <https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-taxii-client>`_ but should be compatible with any TAXII client which makes HTTP requests\nas defined in TAXII 2.0 specification.\n\n*medallion* has been designed to be a simple front-end REST server providing access to the endpoints defined in that specification.\nIt uses the python framework - `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_.  *medallion* depends on back-end \"plugins\" which handle the\npersistance of the TAXII data and metadata.\nThe TAXII specification is agnostic to what type of data a TAXII server stores, but this will usually be STIX 2 content.\n\nTwo back-end plugins are provided with *medallion*:\nthe Memory back-end and the MongoDB back-end.  The Memory back-end persists data \"in memory\".  It is initalized using a json file that contains TAXII data\nand metadata.\nIt is possible to save the current state of the in memory store, but this back-end is really intended only for testing purposes.  The MongoDB backend is\nsomewhat more robust\nand makes use of a MongoDB server, installed independently.  The MongoDB back-end can only be used if the pymongo python package is installed.  An error\nmessage will\nresult if it is used without that package.\n\n`Installation`\n==============\n\nThe easiest way to install *medallion* is with pip:\n\n::\n\n  $ pip install medallion\n\n\n`Usage`\n=======\n\n\n\nTo run *medallion*:\n\n::\n\n    $ python medallion/scripts/run.py <config-file>\n\nThe <config_file> contains:\n\n- configuration information for the backend plugin\n- a simple user name/password dictionary\n\nTo use the Memory back-end plug, include the following in the <config-file>:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    \"backend\": {\n        \"type\": \"memory\",\n        \"data_file\": <path to json file with initial data>\n    }\n\nTo use the Mongo DB back-end plug, include the following in the <config-file>:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    \"backend\": {\n        \"type\": \"mongodb\",\n        \"url\": <Mongo DB server url>  # e.g., \"mongodb://localhost:27017/\"\n    }\n\n*Note: A Mongo DB should be available at some URL when using the Mongo DB back-end*\n\nAs required by the TAXII specification, *medallion* supports BasicHTTP authorization.  However, the user names and passwords are currently\nstored in the <config_file> in plain text.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    \"users\": {\n        \"admin\": \"Password0\",\n        \"user1\": \"Password1\",\n        \"user2\": \"Password2\"\n    }\n\nThe authorization is enabled using the python package `flask_httpauth <https://flask-httpauth.readthedocs.io>`_.\nAuthorization could be enhanced by changing the method \"decorated\" using\n@auth.get_password in medallion/__init__.py\n\nWe welcome contributions for other back-end plugins.\n\nGovernance\n==========\n\nThis GitHub public repository (\n**https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-taxii-client** ) was created at the request\nof the `OASIS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) TC\n<https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cti/>`__ as an `OASIS Open Repository\n<https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/>`__ to support\ndevelopment of open source resources related to Technical Committee work.\n\nWhile this Open Repository remains associated with the sponsor TC, its\ndevelopment priorities, leadership, intellectual property terms, participation\nrules, and other matters of governance are `separate and distinct\n<https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-taxii-client/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#governance-distinct-from-oasis-tc-process>`__\nfrom the OASIS TC Process and related policies.\n\nAll contributions made to this Open Repository are subject to open source\nlicense terms expressed in the `BSD-3-Clause License\n<https://www.oasis-open.org/sites/www.oasis-open.org/files/BSD-3-Clause.txt>`__.\nThat license was selected as the declared `\"Applicable License\"\n<https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses>`__ when the\nOpen Repository was created.\n\nAs documented in `\"Public Participation Invited\n<https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-taxii-client/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#public-participation-invited>`__\",\ncontributions to this OASIS Open Repository are invited from all parties,\nwhether affiliated with OASIS or not.
