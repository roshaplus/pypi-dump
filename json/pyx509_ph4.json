    "description": "pyx509: X.509 Certificate and PKCS7 Parser / Verifier for Python\n################################################################\n\nThis is a fork of the original project:\n\n    pyx509 - Python library for parsing X.509\n    Copyright (C) 2009-2012  CZ.NIC, z.s.p.o. (http://www.nic.cz)\n\nWork in progress!\n\nDescription\n===========\n\nThis is probably the most complete parser of X.509 certificates in python.\n\nCode is in alpha stage! Don't use for anything sensitive. I wrote it (based on\nprevious work of colleagues) since there is no comprehensive python parser for\nX.509 certificates. Often python programmers had to parse openssl output.\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n* I find it less painful to use than parsing output of 'openssl x509'\n  somewhat stricter in extension parsing compared to openssl\n\nDisadvantages\n-------------\n\n* It's slow compared to openssl (about 2.3x compared to RHEL's openssl-1.0-fips)\n\n* Currently not very strict in what string types in RDNs it accepts\n\n* API is still rather ugly and has no documentation yet; code is nasty at some\n  places (and there's some old dangling code like pkcs7/verifier.py)\n\n\nDependencies\n============\n\n* pyasn1 >= 0.1.7\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nInstall with pip::\n\n    pip install pyx509_ph4\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nLGPL v2 or later.\n\nSee LICENSE.txt.\n\n\nKnown bugs and quirks\n=====================\n\n* Subject alternative name doesn't show all subtypes,\n  but 'DNS', 'dirName' and 'email' are supported.\n\n* Name constraints don't distinguish among various GeneralName subtypes\n\n* Some extensions are not shown very nicely when put in string format\n\n* Not all extensions are supported\n\n* String types accepted for various RDN subelements are rather too permissive\n\n* RDN string conversion does not conform to RFC 4514\n\n* Badly formed extensions are ignored if not marked critical\n\n  * easy to switch to more strict behavior\n\n  * other clients do this as well; RFC 5280 specifies behavior for unknown\n    elements in extensions in appendix B.1, but does not cover all cases (e.g.\n    element exists, but with string type different from spec)\n\nTODO\n====\n\n* Cleanup: This module has it's own pyasn1 models. Look if we can\n  reuse the pyasn1_modules.rfc2459 X509 cert model.\n\n* Cleanup: Currently, the signature verifier does not work.",
