It uses a Python 3 implementation of the `SQLite on-disk file format <https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html>`_ to recover deleted table rows.\n\nSQBrite's name is inspired by `PL Daniels' <https://github.com/inflex>`_ `undark <http://pldaniels.com/undark/>`_, but is a completely separate implementation.\n\n.. image:: https://asciinema.org/a/118939.png\n    :target: https://asciinema.org/a/118939\n    :alt: SQBrite demo terminal recording\n\nInstalling SQBrite\n------------------\n\nSQBrite requires Python 3. To install, simply run:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip3 install --user sqbrite\n    $ sqbrite --help\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nSQLite uses a paginated data model in which each database is a collection of same-size *pages*. There are several kinds of pages, of which one type (B-Tree Table Leaf pages) contains the starting point for actual data belonging to individual table rows.\n\nWhen a row is deleted by means of a ``DELETE FROM table (...)`` statement, the space occupied by that row's data (a *record*) within the relevant B-Tree Table Leaf page is marked as free and may subsequently be used to store new records or update existing records. However, it is common to see freed space within a page (a *freeblock*, in SQLite parlance) left alone after rows are deleted. In that case, it ***may*** be possible to retrieve deleted row data from within the freeblock.\n\nHeuristics\n++++++++++\n\nThe SQLite file format doesn't keep track of where deleted records start and end within a leaf page's freeblocks. This means that SQBrite needs a mechanism to find out where record headers start. This is achieved through the use of byte-wise regular expressions specific to tables in known databases. These regular expressions and the offset that separates matches from the first byte in a well-formed header are stored in a user-editable YAML file.\n\nSQBrite aims to ship with heuristics for popular SQLite databases, so **do** send pull requests if you've got good results with your heuristics.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Export all records to CSV or reinject \"undeleted\" records into a copy of the database\n- Extensible heuristics - just add entries to ``~/.local/share/sqbrite/sqbrite.yaml``!\n- SQBrite can recover records from within active B-tree table leaf pages or from former table-leaf Freelist pages.\n- Heuristics for iOS and Firefox databases\n\nLimitations\n-----------\n\n- SQBrite works better when ``ptrmap`` pages are present\n- The ``undelete`` subcommand may fail when re-inserting deleted rows into a table causes a constraint violation\n- SQBrite cannot recover records deleted with the `SQLite secure_delete pragma <https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_secure_delete>`_ enabled\n- Recovering data from overflow pages that have become Freelist leaf pages is not currently supported\n",
