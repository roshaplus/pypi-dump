    "description": "\npptx-downsizer\n==============\n\nPython tool for downsizing Microsoft PowerPoint presentations (pptx)\nfiles.\n\nhttps://github.com/scholer/pptx-downsizer\n\nCurrently only supports downsizing of images (not e.g. videos and other\nmedia files).\n\n\nUse cases:\n----------\n\nWhy might someone want to downsize a Power Point presentation?\n\nIf you are like me, when you create a PowerPoint presentation, you just\nthrow in a lot of images on the slides without paying too much attention\nto how large the images are.\n\nYou may even use the \"screenshot\" feature (Cmd+shift+4 on Mac) to\nquickly capture images of whatever you have on your screen, and paste it\ninto the PowerPoint presentation (using \"Paste special\"). In which case\nyou are actually creating large TIFF images in your presentation (at\nleast for PowerPoint 2016).\n\nEven though the images in the presentation are compressed/zipped when\nsaving the presentation file, the presentation will still be\nsignificantly larger than it actually needs to be.\n\nHowever, once you realize that your presentation is 100+ MBs, you don't\nhave the time to re-save a lower-quality version of each image and then\nsubstitute that image in the presentation.\n\nQ: What to do?\n\nA: **First**, use the built-in \"Compress Pictures\" feature: Go \"File ->\nCompress pictures\", or select any image, go to the \"Picture Tools\"\ntoolbar, and select the \"Compress Pictures\" icon (four arrows pointing\nto the corners of an image). This tool allows you to down-scale pictures\nand removed cropped-out areas, and can be applied to all pictures in the\npresentation at once, *but does not change the image format of pictures\nin the presentation.*\n\nMake sure to save your presentation under a new name, in case you want\nto revert some of the compressed pictures!\n\nA: **Then**, use ``pptx-downsizer``!\n\n``pptx-downsizer`` will go over all images in your presentation (pptx),\nand down-size all images above a certain size.\n\n-  By default, all images are converted to PNG format (except for JPEGs\n   which remains in JPEG format).\n-  You can also choose to use JPEG format (recommended only after doing\n   an initial downsizing using PNG).\n-  If images are more than a certain limit (default 2048 pixels) in\n   either dimension (width, height), they are down-scaled to a more\n   reasonable size (you most likely do not need very high-resolution\n   images in your presentation, since most projectors still have a\n   relatively low resolution anyways.)\n\nQ: How much can I expect ``pptx-downsizer`` to reduce my powerpoint\npresentations (pptx files)?\n\nA: If you have copy/pasted a lot of screenshots (TIFF files), it is not\nuncommon to for the presentation to be reduced to less than half (and in\nsome case one fourth) of the original file size. If you further convert\nremaining large PNG images to JPEG (as a separate downsizing), you\nshould be able to get another 30-50 percent reduction. Of course, this\nall depends on how large your original images are and how much you are\nwilling to\n\n\nExamples:\n---------\n\nMake sure to save your presentation (and, preferably exit PowerPoint,\nand make a backup of your presentation just in case).\n\nLet's say you have your original, large presentation saved as\n``Presentation.pptx``\n\nAfter installing ``pptx-downsizer``, you can run the following from your\nterminal (notice the substitution of the hyphen for an underscore)::\n\n    pptx_downsizer \"Presentation.pptx\"\n\nIf you want to change the file size limit used to determine what images\nare down-sized to 1 MB (\u2248 1'000'000 bytes)::\n\n    pptx_downsizer \"Presentation.pptx\" --fsize-filter 1e6\n\nIf you want to disable down-scaling of large high-resolution images, set\n``img-max-size`` to 0::\n\n    pptx_downsizer \"Presentation.pptx\" --img-max-size 0\n\nIf you want to convert large images to JPEG format::\n\n    pptx_downsizer \"Presentation.pptx\" --convert-to jpeg\n\n\nInstallation:\n-------------\n\nFirst, make sure you have Python 3+ installed. I recommend using the\nAnaconda Python distribution, which makes everything a lot easier.\n\nWith python installed, install ``pptx-downsizer`` using ``pip``::\n\n    pip install pptx-downsizer\n\nYou can make sure ``pptx-downsizer`` is installed by invoking it\nanywhere from the terminal (command line)::\n\n    pptx_downsizer\n\nNote: You may want to install ``pptx-downsizer`` in a\nseparate/non-default python environment. (If you know what that means,\nyou already know how to do that. If you do not know what that means,\nthen don't worry\u2013you probably don't need it after all).\n\n\nTroubleshooting and bugs:\n-------------------------\n\n**NOTE:** ``pptx-downsizer`` is very early/beta software. I strongly\nrecommend to (a) *back up your presentation to a separate folder before\nrunning* ``pptx_downsizer``, and (b) *work for as long as possible in\nthe original presentation.* That way, if ``pptx-downsizer`` doesn't\nwork, you can always go back to your original presentation, and you will\nnot have lost any work.\n\nQ: HELP! I ran the downsizer and now the presentation won't open or\nPowerPoint gives errors when opening the pptx file!\n\nA: Sorry that ``pptx-downsizer`` didn't work for you. If you want, feel\nfree to send me a copy of both the presentation and the downsized pptx\nfile produced by this script, and I'll try to figure out what the\nproblem is. There are, unfortunately, a lot of things that could be\nwrong, and without the original presentation, I probably cannot diagnose\nthe issue.\n\n**OBS: If PowerPoint gives you errors when opening the downsized file,\nplease don't bother trying to fix the downsized file yourself. You may\nrun into unexpected errors later. Instead, just continue working with\nyour original presentation.**\n\nQ: Why doesn't ``pptx-downsizer`` work?\n\nA: It works for me and all the ``.pptx`` files I've thrown at it.\nHowever, there are obviously going to be a lot of scenarios that I\nhaven't run into yet.\n\nQ: Does ``pptx-downsizer`` overwrite the original presentation file?\n\nA: No, by default ``pptx-downsizer`` will create a new file with\n\".downsized\" postfix. If the intended output already exists,\n``pptx_downloader`` will let you know, giving you a change to (manually)\nmove/rename the existing file if you want to keep it. You can disable\nthis prompt using the ``--overwrite`` argument.\n",
