Catwalk builds upon the functionality offered by scikit-learn by implementing:\n        \n        - Saving of modeling results and metadata in a [Postgres database](https://github.com/dssg/results-schema) for later analysis\n        - Exposure of computationally-intensive tasks as discrete workloads that can be used with different parallelization solutions (e.g. multiprocessing, Celery)\n        - Different model persistence strategies such as on-filesystem or Amazon S3, that can be easily switched between\n        - Hashing classifier model configuration to only retrain a model if necessary.\n        - Various best practices in areas like input scaling for different classifier types and feature importance\n        - Common scikit-learn model evaluation metrics as well as the ability to bundle custom evaluation metrics\n        \n        \n        ## Components\n        \n        This functionality is concentrated in the following components:\n        \n        - [catwalk.ModelTrainer](catwalk/model_trainers.py): Train a configured experiment grid on pre-made design matrices, and store each model's metadata and feature importances in a database.\n        - [catwalk.Predictor](catwalk/predictors.py): Given a trained model and another matrix (ie, a test matrix), generate prediction probabilities and store them in a database.\n        - [catwalk.ModelEvaluator](catwalk/evaluation.py): Given a set of model prediction probabilities, generate metrics (for instance, precision and recall at various thresholds) and store them in a database.\n        \n        ## Usage\n        \n        Below is a complete sample usage of the three Catwalk components.\n        \n        ```\n        \n        import datetime\n        \n        import pandas\n        from sqlalchemy import create_engine\n        \n        from metta import metta_io as metta\n        \n        from catwalk.storage import FSModelStorageEngine, MettaCSVMatrixStore\n        from catwalk.model_trainers import ModelTrainer\n        from catwalk.predictors import Predictor\n        from catwalk.evaluation import ModelEvaluator\n        from catwalk.utils import save_experiment_and_get_hash\n        \n        \n        # create a sqlalchemy database engine pointing to a Postgres database\n        db_engine = create_engine(...)\n        \n        # A path on your filesystem under which to store matrices and models\n        project_path = 'mytestproject/modeling'\n        \n        # create a toy train matrix from scratch\n        # and saving it using metta to generate a unique id for its metadata\n        # catwalk uses both the matrix and metadata\n        train_matrix = pandas.DataFrame.from_dict({\n        \t'entity_id': [1, 2],\n        \t'feature_one': [3, 4],\n        \t'feature_two': [5, 6],\n        \t'label': [7, 8]\n        }).set_index('entity_id')\n        train_metadata = {\n        \t'beginning_of_time': datetime.date(2012, 12, 20),\n        \t'end_time': datetime.date(2016, 12, 20),\n        \t'label_name': 'label',\n        \t'label_window': '1y',\n        \t'feature_names': ['ft1', 'ft2'],\n        }\n        train_matrix_uuid = metta.archive_matrix(train_metadata, train_matrix, format='csv')\n        \n        # The MettaCSVMatrixStore bundles the matrix and metadata together\n        # for catwalk to use\n        train_matrix_store = MettaCSVMatrixStore(\n        \tmatrix_path='{}.csv'.format(train_matrix_uuid),\n        \tmetadata_path='{}.yaml'.format(train_matrix_uuid)\n        )\n        \n        \n        # Similarly, create a test matrix\n        as_of_date = datetime.date(2016, 12, 21)\n        \n        test_matrix = pandas.DataFrame.from_dict({\n        \t'entity_id': [3],\n        \t'feature_one': [8],\n        \t'feature_two': [5],\n        \t'label': [5]\n        }).set_index('entity_id')\n        \n        test_metadata = {\n        \t'label_name': 'label',\n        \t'label_window': '1y',\n        \t'end_time': as_of_date,\n        }\n        test_matrix_uuid = metta.archive_matrix(test_metadata, test_matrix, format='csv')\n        \n        # The MettaCSVMatrixStore bundles the matrix and metadata together\n        # for catwalk to use\n        test_matrix_store = MettaCSVMatrixStore(\n        \tmatrix_path='{}.csv'.format(test_matrix_uuid),\n        \tmetadata_path='{}.yaml'.format(test_matrix_uuid)\n        )\n        \n        # The ModelStorageEngine handles the persistence of model pickles\n        # In this case, we are using FSModelStorageEngine to use the local filesystem\n        model_storage_engine = FSModelStorageEngine(project_path)\n        \n        # To ensure that we can relate all of our persistent database records with\n        # each other, we bind them together with an experiment hash.
