    "description": "The Modeling Framework fills the gap between the Python object world and\r\nrelational databases in that it allows users to transparently create,\r\nretrieve, update, or delete Python objects from a database without having to\r\nwrite a single line of SQL. Its main features include generation of database\r\nschema, generation of Python code templates ready to be used, support for\r\ntransparent mapping of (class) inheritance in relational databases,\r\nobject-oriented query language, use of standard Python getters to traverse\r\nrelationships (the related objects are automatically fetched when needed and\r\nwhen appropriate), and automatic checking for referential-integrity\r\nconstraints, etc. Supported databases are MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and\r\nSQLite.",
