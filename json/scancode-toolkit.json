License and origin information is often scattered and not\neasy to find: ScanCode discovers this data for you.\n\nScanCode provides reasonably accurate scan results and the line position\nwhere each result is found. The results can be formatted as JSON or\nHTML, and ScanCode provides a simple HTML app for quick visualization of\nscan results.\n\nWe are continuously working on new features, such as analysis of\ndependencies or improving  performance for scanning of larger codebases.\n\nSee the roadmap for upcoming features:\nhttps://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/wiki/Roadmap\n\n.. image:: samples/screenshot.png\n\n\nQuick Start\n===========\n\nFor Windows, please go to the \n`Comprehensive Installation <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/wiki/Comprehensive-Installation>`_ \nsection instead.\n\nMake sure you have Python 2.7 installed:\n * Download and install Python 2.7 32 bits for Windows \n   https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.13/python-2.7.13.msi\n * Download and install Python 2.7 for Mac \n   https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.13/python-2.7.13-macosx10.6.pkg\n\nOn Linux install Python 2.7 \"devel\" and a few extra packages:\n\n * ``sudo apt-get install python-dev bzip2 xz-utils zlib1g libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev``\n   for Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04 and 16.04\n\n * ``sudo apt-get install python-dev libbz2-1.0 xz-utils zlib1g libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev``\n   for Debian and Debian-based distros\n\n * ``sudo yum install python-devel zlib bzip2-libs xz-libs libxml2-devel libxslt-devel``\n   for RPM distros\n\n * See the Comprehensive Installation for additional details and other\n   Linux installations: https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/wiki/Comprehensive-Installation\n\nNext, download and extract the latest ScanCode release from::\n\n    https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/releases/\n\nOpen a terminal, extract the downloaded release archive, then `cd` to\nthe extracted directory and run this command to display the command\nhelp. ScanCode will self-configure if needed::\n\n    ./scancode --help\n\nRun a sample scan saved to the `samples.html` file::\n\n    ./scancode --format html-app samples samples.html\n\nThen open `samples.html` in your web browser to view the scan results. \n\nSee more command examples::\n\n    ./scancode --examples\n\n\nSupport\n=======\n\nIf you have a problem, a suggestion or found a bug, please enter a ticket at:\nhttps://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues\n\nFor other questions, discussions, and chats, we have:\n\n- a mailing list at https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/aboutcode-discuss\n\n- an official Gitter channel at https://gitter.im/aboutcode-org/discuss\n  Gitter also has an IRC bridge at https://irc.gitter.im/\n\n- an official #aboutcode IRC channel on freenode (server chat.freenode.net)\n  for scancode and other related tools. Note that this receives\n  notifactions from repos so it can be a tad noisy. You can use your\n  favorite IRC client or use the web chat at\n  https://webchat.freenode.net/\n\n\nAbout archives\n==============\n\nAll code must be extracted before running ScanCode since ScanCode will\nnot extract files from tarballs, zip files, etc. However, the ScanCode\nToolkit comes with a utility called extractcode that does recursive\narchive extraction. For example, this command will recursively extract\nthe mytar.tar.bz2 tarball in the mytar.tar.bz2-extract directory::\n\n    ./extractcode mytar.tar.bz2\n\n\nSource code\n===========\n\n* https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit.git\n* https://github.com/nexB/scancode-thirdparty-src.git\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n* Apache-2.0 with an acknowledgement required to accompany the scan output.\n* Public domain CC-0 for reference datasets.\n* Multiple licenses (GPL2/3, LGPL, MIT, BSD, etc.) for third-party components. \n\nSee the NOTICE file for more details.\n\n\nDocumentation & FAQ\n===================\n\nhttps://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/wiki\n\n\nBasic Usage\n===========\n\nRun this command for a list of options (On Windows use `scancode`\ninstead of `./scancode`)::\n\n    ./scancode --help\n\nRun this command for a list of command line examples::\n\n    ./scancode --examples\n\nTo run a scan on sample data, first run this::\n\n    ./scancode --format html-app samples samples.html\n\nThen open samples.html in your web browser to see the results.\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n\n2.1.0 (NEXT)\n------------------\n\n This is a minor release with minor new and improved features and bug\n fixes.\n\n * New and improved license detection, including refined match scoring\n   for #534\n * New \"base_name\" attribute returned with file information. Reported by\n   @chinyeungli\n * Bug fixed in Maven POM package detection. Reported by @kalagp\n * Bug fixed in License detection leading to a very long scan time for some\n   rare JavaScript files. Reported by @jarnugirdhar\n\n\n2.0.0 (2017-06-23)\n------------------\n\n This is a major release with several new and improved features and bug\n fixes.\n\n Some of the key highlights include:\n\n * License:\n\n   * Brand new, faster and accurate detection engine using multiple\n     techniques eventually doing multiple exhaustive comparisons of\n     a scanned file content against all the license and rule texts.\n\n   * Several new licenses and over 2500+ new and improved licenses\n     detection rules have been added making the detection significantly\n     better (and weirdly enough faster too as a side-effect of the new\n     detection engine)\n\n   * the matched license text can be optionally returned with the\n     `--license-text` option\n\n   * The detection accuracy has been benchmarked against other detection\n     engine and ScanCode has shown to be more accurate and\n     comprehensive than all the other engines reviewed.\n\n   * improved scoring of license matches\n\n\n * Package and dependencies:\n\n  * new and improved detection of multiple package formats: NPM, Maven,\n    NuGet, PHP Composer, Python Pypi and RPM. In most cases direct,\n    declared dependencies are also reported.\n\n  * several additional package formats will be reported in the future\n    version.\n\n  * note: the structure of Packages data is evolving and should not be\n    considered API at this stage\n\n\n * Scan outputs: \n\n  * New SPDX tag/values and RDF outputs.\n\n  * new compact JSON format (the pretty printed format is still\n    available with the the `json-pp` format).\n    The JSON format has been changed significantly and is closer to a\n    documented, standard format that we call the ABC data format.\n\n  * Minor refinements on the html and html-app format. Note that the\n    html-app format will be deprecated and replaced by the new AboutCode\n    Manager desktop app (electron-based) in future versions.\n\n\n * Copyright: Improved copyright detection: several false positive are\n   no longer returned and copyright s are more accurate\n\n\n * Archive: support for shallow extraction and support for new archive\n   types (such as Spring boot shell archives)\n\n\n * Performance:\n\n  * Everything is generally faster, and license detection performance\n    has been significantly improved.\n\n  * Scans can run on multiple processes in parallel with the new \n    `--processes` option speeding up things even further. A scan of a\n    full Debian pool of source packages was reported to scan in about\n    11 hours (on a rather beefy 144 cores, 256GB machine)\n\n  * Reduced memory usage with the use of caching\n\n * Other notes:\n\n   * This is the last release with Linux 32 bits architecture support\n   * The scan of a file can be interrupted after a timeout with a 120\n     seconds default\n   * ScanCode is now available as a library on the Pypi Python package\n     index for use as a library. The documentation for the library usage\n     will follow in future versions\n   * New `--ignore` option: You can optionally ignore certain file and\n     paths during a scan\n   * New `--diag option`: display additional debug and diagnostic data\n   * The scanned file paths can now reported as relative, rooted or\n     absolute with new command line options with a default to a rooted\n     path. \n\n\n Thank you to all contributors to this release and the 200+ stars\n and 60+ forks on GitHub!\n\n * Credits in alphabetic order:\n\n  Alexander Lisianoi\n  Avi Aryan\n  Benedikt Spranger\n  Chin Yeung\n  Dennis Clark\n  Hugo Jacob\n  Jakub Wilk\n  Jericho @attritionorg\n  Jillian Daguil\n  Jiri Popelka\n  John M.
