    "description": "Benchmark framework for scientists\n----------------------------------\n\nMetrika is a library to run and measure benchmarks with\nscientific rigor. By automating the process of benchmark\nrunning, scientists can avoid common mistakes. Metrika\nallows to obtain statistically solid measures without\naccidentally introducing methodological errors. In order\nto do that, the library executes the benchmarks many times\nand presents results taking into account things like expected\nvalue, standard deviation, etc.\n\nThis version requires Python 3 or later",
