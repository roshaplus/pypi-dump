    "description": "[![Join the FISSA chat](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/rochefort-lab/fissa)\n[![Shippable](https://img.shields.io/shippable/56391d7a1895ca4474227917.svg)](https://app.shippable.com/projects/56391d7a1895ca4474227917)\n\nFISSA\n=====\n\nFISSA (Fast Image Signal Separation Analysis) is a Python library for decontaminating\nsomatic signals from 2-photon calcium imaging data.\nIt can read images in tiff format and ROIs in zips as exported by ImageJ, or Numpy arrays\nin general after importing from different formats.\n\nCurrently, FISSA is only available for Python 2.7, and has been tested on\nUbuntu 17.04 and on Windows 7 with the\n[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) distribution.\n\nIf you encounter a specific problem please\n[open a new issue](https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/issues/new).\nFor general discussion and help with installation or setup, please see the\n[Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/rochefort-lab/fissa).\n\nUsage\n-----\nA general tutorial on the use of FISSA can be found at:\n<https://rochefort-lab.github.io/fissa/examples/Basic%20usage.html>\n\nAn example workflow with another Python toolbox (SIMA):\n<https://rochefort-lab.github.io/fissa/examples/SIMA%20example.html>\n\nAn example workflow importing data exported from a MATLAB toolbox (cNMF):\n<https://rochefort-lab.github.io/fissa/examples/cNMF%20example.html>\n\nThese notebooks can also be downloaded from this repository and run on your own machine, by downloading the examples folder: <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/tree/master/examples>\nand then running them in a jupyter notebook (for a tutorial see https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook).\n\nInstallation\n------------\n### Installation on Windows\n#### Basic prerequisites\nDownload and install, in the following order:\n* Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7: <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266>\n\n* Python 2.7 Anaconda as the Python environment, available from\n<https://www.anaconda.com/download/>.\n\n\n#### Installing FISSA\nOpen `Anaconda Prompt.exe`, which can be found through the Windows\nstart menu or search, and type or copy-paste (by right clicking) the following:\n\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge shapely \nconda install tifffile -c conda-forge\n```\n\nThen, install FISSA as follows\n\n```\npip install fissa\n```\nTo test if FISSA installed correctly type\n```\npython\n```\nand then\n```\nimport fissa\n```\nIf no errors show up, FISSA installed correctly. \n\nIf you want to use the interactive plotting from the notebooks also install\nthe HoloViews plotting toolbox as follows\n\n```\nconda install -c ioam holoviews\n```\n\nLeave Python by typing exit(), or just close the window. See usage above for how to use FISSA.\n\n### Installation on Linux\n\nBefore installing FISSA, you will need to make sure you have all of its dependencies\n(and the dependencies of its dependencies) installed.\n\nHere we will outline how to do all of these steps, assuming you already have both\nPython 2.7 and pip installed. It is highly likely that your Linux distribution ships with these.\n\n#### Dependencies of dependencies\n* [scipy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scipy/) requires a\n  [Fortran compiler and BLAS/LAPACK/ATLAS](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/building/linux.html#installation-from-source).\n\n* [shapely](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely) requires GEOS.\n\nThese packages can be installed on *Debian/Ubuntu* with the following shell\ncommands.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gfortran libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libatlas-dev libatlas-base-dev\nsudo apt-get install libgeos-dev\n```\n\n#### Installing FISSA\nInstall basic FISSA as:\n\n```\npip install fissa\n```\n\nWith the libraries required to run the notebooks with plots:\n\n```\npip install fissa['plotting']\n```\n\nTo test if FISSA installed correctly type\n```\npython\n```\nand then\n```\nimport fissa\n```\nIf no errors show up, FISSA installed correctly.\n\nFolder Structure\n----------------\n\n### examples\nContains example code. You can load the notebooks as .ipynb directly in GitHub,\nor on your system if you know how to use jupyter notebooks.\n\n### exampleData\nContains example data. It a zipfile with region of interests from ImageJ.\nIt also contains three tiff stacks, which have been downsampled and cropped\nfrom full data from the Rochefort lab.\n\n### fissa\nContains the toolbox.\n\n\nCiting FISSA\n------------\n\nIf you use FISSA for your research, please cite the following paper\nin any resulting publications:\n\n_Paper in preparation_\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nUnless otherwise stated in individual files, all code is\nCopyright (c) 2015, Sander Keemink, Scott Lowe, and Nathalie Rochefort.\nAll rights reserved.\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\nas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\nof the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
