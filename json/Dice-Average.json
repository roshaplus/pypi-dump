    "description": "This mini app is my first application with a GUI. It uses easygui, and is therefore very basic. I have created an app that rolls a user defined die a million times, and calculates the average roll. This would be useful for anyone who does not know the easy way to discover the average of a die roll for an even numbered die.",
