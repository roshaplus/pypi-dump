    "description": "# GlovePy\n\nA Python implementation with Cython of the [GloVe](http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) algorithm with multi-threaded training.\nthis Python package mainly contains two Python classes. The first Python class (Corpus) builds the co-occurrence matrix given a collection of\ndocuments; while the second Python class (Glove) will generate vector representations for words.\n\nGloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for generating vector representations for words developed by Stanford NLP lab.\nThe paper describing the model is [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/glove.pdf). In contrast with\n[Word2Vec](https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/) (there is a great Python implementation in [gensim](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html))\nwhich is often referred as prediction method, GloVe is called counting method which the embedding is produced by factorizing the logarithm of the\ncorpus word co-occurrence matrix.\n\nThe original implementation for this Machine Learning model can be [found here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). This work is based on the work of [glove-python](https://github.com/maciejkula/glove-python) and [glove](https://github.com/JonathanRaiman/glove).\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall from the source code: `python setup.py install`.",
