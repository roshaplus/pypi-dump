    "description": "Plateo\n======\n\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Edinburgh-Genome-Foundry/Plateo/master/docs/_static/images/title.png\n   :alt: [logo]\n   :align: center\n   :width: 500px\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/Edinburgh-Genome-Foundry/Plateo.svg?branch=master\n  :target: https://travis-ci.org/Edinburgh-Genome-Foundry/DnaCauldron\n  :alt: Travis CI build status\n\nPlateo (pronounced *Plato*, like the planet) is a Python library to assist in the\nplanning, running and checking of laboratory experiments involving microplates.\n\nIt can be used to:\n\n- Read and write robotic protocols (picklists) in different formats to\n  accomodate different liquid dispensers (Tecan EVO, Labcyte Echo).\n- Simulate liquid dispensing runs, taking into account the capacity and dead\n  volume of each container, to predict the maps of future plates.\n- Parse plate data from common laboratory robots (for kinetic experiments,\n  fragment analysis, qPCR, etc.)\n- Export plate information in various formats (graphics, spreadsheets, HTML,\n  JSON, etc.).\n\nWork in progress - contribute !\n-------------------------------\n\nPlateo is an open-source software originally written at the `Edinburgh Genome Foundry\n<http://www.genomefoundry.io>`_ (an academic platform) by `Zulko <https://github.com/Zulko>`_\nand `released on Github <https://github.com/Edinburgh-Genome-Foundry/plateo>`_\nunder the MIT licence (\u00a2 Edinburgh Genome Foundry).\n\nIt was released in the hope that it will be as useful for other automated labs as it is for use,\nbut keep in mind that it is still under development, the features and docs will get better.\n\nPlateo aims at collecting parsers and export routines to speak to any kind of\nautomated equipment. If you have written parsers that don't appear in Plateo,\nwe are happy to hear about it. If you need help writing parsers for your favorite\nrobot, we may be able to help too !\n\n\nInstallation\n--------------\n\nPlateo can be installed by unzipping the source code in one directory and using this command: ::\n\n    (sudo) python setup.py install\n\nYou can also install it directly from the Python Package Index with this command: ::\n\n    (sudo) pip install plateo\n\nCode organization\n------------------\n\n- ``Plate.py``, ``Well.py`` and ``Picklist.py`` implement the central objects\n  ``Plate``, ``Well``, and ``Picklist``.\n- The ``containers`` folder contains specific classes of ``Plate`` and ``Well``\n  will predefined dimensions, capacity, dead volume, etc.\n- The ``parsers`` folder contains all methods to generate Plates or Picklists\n  from machine files and data.\n- The ``exporters`` folder contains all methods to export plates in picklists\n  in human- or machine-readable format.\n",
