    "description": "`pyburrow` is a Python 3 library for crawling websites: capturing,\narchiving and processing their resources.  It is different from all\nother known crawlers by being very *low level*: the HTTP response body\nis stored as raw unencoded bytes, and further the HTTP response\nheaders and status codes are stored as well.  The resulting rich data\nset is a trove for data mining and analysis.",
