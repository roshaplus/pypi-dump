    "description": "# Soundcloud-lib\nThis is a Soundcloud API library that doesn't require a client ID to function.  It's basic, it can really only fetch tracks and playlists, but doesn't require the user to go through the soundcloud app approval process.\n\n# Why\nI once applied for API access and was approved.  I used this access for months until it was revoked for some reason and all my emails and new applications were ignored.  I decided to create a library that allows me to do Soundcloud API stuff without an approved application.\n\n# Features\n* Does not require a client ID\n* Fetches and writes mp3 metadata (Album artist, title, artwork)\n* Can fetch entire playlists of tracks\n\n# Installation\nThis library is installable as a pip package.\n```\npip install soundcloud-lib\n```\n\n# How\nThis library uses **programming** and **algorithms** to find a client ID that can be used to access the Soundcloud API.  If you want, you can pass your own client ID as the first argument of `SoundcloudAPI()`.\n\n## Saving an mp3 to a file.\nThis will write the ID3 tags for album artist, track title AND will embed the album artwork into the mp3.\n```python\nfrom sclib import SoundcloudAPI, Track, Playlist\n\napi = SoundcloudAPI()\n\ntrack = api.resolve('https://soundcloud.com/itsmeneedle/sunday-morning')\n\nassert type(track) is Track\n\nfilename = f'./{track.artist} - {track.title}.mp3'\n\nwith open(filename, 'wb+') as fp:\n    track.write_mp3_to(fp)\n\n```\n\n\n## Fetch a playlist\n\n```python\nfrom sclib import SoundcloudAPI, Track, Playlist\n\napi = SoundcloudAPI()\nplaylist = api.resolve('https://soundcloud.com/playlist_url')\n\nassert type(playlist) is Playlist\n\nfor track in playlist.tracks:\n\n    print(f'Downloading {track.artist} - {track.title}')\n    write_mp3_to_file(track)\n\n```\n\n# Bugs or Features\nPlease report any and all bugs using the issues tab.\n\nFeel free to suggest new features too.\n\n\n# Contributing\nSure, submit a pull request.",
