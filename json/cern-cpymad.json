    "description": "**There are currently no active developers working on this project. At the moment the code is still working\r\nfine against the current stable and development version of Mad-X, so it should still be useful.\r\nBelow you find a list of alternative projects which may have a more complete feature set and documentation.**\r\n\r\n**Known Forks and Similar Projects:**\r\n - https://github.com/hibtc/cpymad\r\n - http://jmad.web.cern.ch/jmad/\r\n - https://github.com/pymad/jpymad\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nCPyMAD\r\n------\r\n\r\nCPyMad_ is a Cython_ binding to MAD-X_.\r\n\r\nMAD-X is a software package to simulate particle accelerators and is used\r\nat CERN and all around the world. It has its own proprietary scripting\r\nlanguage and is usually launched from the command line.\r\n\r\nThere is also a binding via JMad_ called JPyMAD_. This has less features\r\nbut does not require a C compiler for installing.\r\n\r\n.. _CPyMAD: https://github.com/pymad/cpymad\r\n.. _Cython: http://cython.org/\r\n.. _MAD-X: http://cern.ch/mad\r\n.. _JMad: http://jmad.web.cern.ch/jmad/\r\n.. _JPyMAD: https://github.com/pymad/jpymad\r\n\r\n*Important:* cern-cpymad links against an unofficial build of MAD-X that\r\nis not supported by CERN, i.e. in case of problems you will not get help\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\nTo build MAD-X and CPyMAD from source you will need\r\n\r\n- CMake_\r\n- python>=2.6\r\n- C / Fortran compilers.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, CPyMAD depends on the following python packages:\r\n\r\n- setuptools_\r\n- Cython_\r\n- NumPy_\r\n- PyYAML_\r\n\r\nThe python packages can be installed using pip_.\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _CMake: http://www.cmake.org/\r\n.. _setuptools: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools\r\n.. _Cython: http://cython.org/\r\n.. _NumPy: http://www.numpy.org/\r\n.. _PyYAML: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML\r\n.. _pip: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions are available at http://pymad.github.io/cpymad/installation.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n~~~~~\r\n\r\n.. code-block:: python\r\n\r\n    from cern import cpymad\r\n\r\n    # Instanciate a model:\r\n    m = cpymad.load_model('lhc')\r\n\r\n    # Calculate TWISS parameters:\r\n    twiss, summary = m.twiss()\r\n\r\n    # Your own analysis below:\r\n    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\r\n    plt.plot(twiss['s'], twiss['betx'])\r\n    plt.show()\r\n\r\n\r\nSee http://pymad.github.io/cpymad for further documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment guidelines\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n**Coding:**\r\n\r\nTry to be consistent with the PEP8_ guidelines as far as you are familiar\r\nwith it. Add `unit tests`_ for all non-trivial functionality.\r\n`Dependency injection`_ is a great pattern to keep modules testable.\r\n\r\n.. _PEP8: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\r\n.. _`unit tests`: http://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html\r\n.. _`Dependency injection`: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlfLCWKxHJ0\r\n\r\n**Version control:**\r\n\r\nCommits should be reversible, independent units if possible. Use descriptive\r\ntitles and also add an explaining commit message unless the modification is\r\ntrivial. See also: `A Note About Git Commit Messages`_.\r\n\r\n.. _`A Note About Git Commit Messages`: http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html\r\n\r\n**Tests:**\r\n\r\nCurrently, two major test services are used:\r\n\r\n- The tests on CDash_ are run on a daily basis on the ``master`` branch and\r\n  on update of the ``testing`` branch. It ensures that the integration\r\n  tests for the LHC models are working correctly on all tested platforms.\r\n  The tests are run only on specific python versions.\r\n\r\n- The `Travis CI`_ service is mainly used to check that the unit tests for\r\n  pymad itself execute on several python versions. Python{2.6,2.7,3.3} are\r\n  supported. The tests are executed on any update of an upstream branch.\r\n\r\n.. _CDash: http://abp-cdash.web.cern.ch/abp-cdash/index.php?project=pymad\r\n.. _`Travis CI`: https://travis-ci.org/pymad/cpymad\r\n\r\n\r\n**Contribution work flow:**\r\n\r\nAll changes are reviewed via pull-requests. Before merging to master the\r\npull-request must reside aliased by the ``testing`` branch long enough to\r\nbe confirmed as stable.  Any issues are discussed in the associated issue\r\nthread.  Concrete suggestions for changes are best posed as pull-requests\r\nonto the feature branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n~~~~~~~\r\n\r\ncern-cpymad must be used in compliance with the licenses as described in\r\nthe following sections:\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense for cern-cpymad source\r\n==============================\r\n\r\napplies to the python source of the cern-cpymad package::\r\n\r\n    Copyright (c) 2011, CERN.

You should use\r\n  *--madxdir* if the library is not installed in a system location.\r\n- add function ``libmadx.is_expanded``\r\n- add function ``libmadx.chdir``\r\n- handle MAD-X table columns with integer arrays\r\n- make ``madx.command`` more powerful (allows ``**kwargs`` and attribute\r\n  access)\r\n- use inherited pipes for IPC with remote MAD-X processes (allows to\r\n  forward stdin/stdout separately)\r\n- close connection to remote process on finalization of ``LibMadxClient``\r\n- remove MAD-X command checks, ``recursive_history`` and filename\r\n  completion\r\n- fix name clash\r\n- fix some bugs\r\n- rename convenience constructors to ``cern.cpymad.load_model`` and\r\n  ``cern.cpymad.start_madx`` due to name clash with module names\r\n\r\n\r\n0.7\r\n===\r\nDate: 16.04.2014\r\n\r\n- close handles in remote process properly on all supported python versions\r\n- rewrite ``libmadx.get_table`` functionality\r\n- madx functions that return tables now return proxy objects instead. For\r\n  backward compatibility these can be iterated to allow unpacking into a tuple\r\n- the returned table columns is now a proxy object as well and not ``TfsTable``\r\n- remove ``retdict`` parameter\r\n- move some cpymad specific functionality into the cpymad package\r\n- add libmadx/madx functions to access list of elements in a sequence\r\n\r\n\r\n0.6\r\n===\r\nDate: 17.03.2014\r\n\r\n- raise exception and don't hang up anymore, if libmadx process crashes\r\n- on python>=3.4, close handles in remote process properly\r\n- let every 'Madx' instance have an independent copy of the madx library.\r\n  this makes the madx module much more useful. previously, this was only\r\n  true for instances of 'cpymad.model'.\r\n- restrict to only one cython module that links to libmadx. (allows static\r\n  linking which is advantageous on windows!)\r\n- use YAML model files instead of JSON\r\n- make 'madx' a submodule of 'cpymad'\r\n- fix test exit status\r\n\r\n\r\n0.5\r\n===\r\nDate: 21.01.2014\r\n\r\n- migrate to setuptools from distutils\r\n- python3 support\r\n- add continuous integration with Travis\r\n- proper setup.py and MANIFEST.in to be used with PyPI\r\n- rename package to 'cern-pymad'\r\n- allow to build from PyPI without having cython",
