Warning::\n      This product is in early development stage; it will not substitute Kupu migration\n      utility and is much less tested.\n      \n      Use at your own risk... **Data.fs backup** can make difference between life and death \n\nTODO\n====\n\n* Internationalization of the UI\n* Plone fixing form needs some love right now\n* Much more test\n* Beeing a complete alternative to Kupu migration tool\n* Also give the \"UID to Path\" feature\n* Relative path conversion is not working for all possibiel path (i.e: '*../foo/a-document*')\n* Transformation will not works if linking method/traverse of target object\n  (i.e: \"foo/image-id/image_thumb\")\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\nThis product was developed by RedTurtle Technology team.\n\n.. image:: http://www.redturtle.net/redturtle_banner.png\n   :alt: RedTurtle Technology Site\n   :target: http://www.redturtle.net/\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n0.1.0a (2010-12-22)\n-------------------\n\n* Initial release",
