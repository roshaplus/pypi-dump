    "description": "pyrogg\n======\n\nWhat is it?\n-----------\n\npyrogg is a simple recoding library for Ogg-Vorbis audio files, implemented in Cython.\nIt reads Vorbis streams from the provided input files and recodes them to the desired\nquality level (-1 ... 10).  It comes with a handy command line interface.\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\nCommand line usage::\n\n   $ recode.py -d outputdir --quality=1 --parallel=3 input1.ogg input2.ogg input3.ogg\n\nPython usage::\n\n   >>> from pyrogg import VorbisFileRecoder\n   >>> rec = VorbisFileRecoder(\"input.ogg\")\n\n   >>> time = rec.recode(\"output.ogg\", quality=1)\n\n\nWhy would I use it?\n-------------------\n\n* It can recode files on the file-system as well as file-like objects.\n\n* It uses OpenMP to decode and encode an input stream in parallel, as well as\n  multiprocessing to recode multiple files in parallel.  So it can use\n  all resources that your machine can provide, which makes it pretty fast.\n\n* Parallel recoding of separate input files is thread-safe and frees the GIL.\n\n\nWhy would I not use it?\n-----------------------\n\n* Currently, error handling isn't very elaborate, so unexpected errors may\n  crash your system.  This should be easy to fix with a little work, and\n  help on this is certainly appreciated.  (Fear not, it's written in Cython,\n  not C.)\n\n* It's not meant to recode streams on the fly, just files and file-like\n  objects.  Currently, input files/objects must allow random access through\n  seek().  This should be fixable.\n\n\nHow can I install it?\n---------------------\n\nUsing pip::\n\n    pip install pyrogg\n\nNote that this will do a source build, so you need a properly configured\nC compiler on your system that can build Python extension modules, as well\nas the library packages ``libogg``, ``libvorbis``, ``libvorbisfile`` and\ntheir corresponding development packages.  Most operating systems (including\nall commonly used Linux distributions) will allow you to install them via\nthe normal package management tool.  For the development packages, look\nfor packages called ``libogg-dev`` or ``libogg-devel``.\n\nFor Windows and MacOS, however, you need to install them manually.
