    "description": "noiseprotocol\n=============\n\nThis repository contains source code of **noiseprotocol** - a Python 3\nimplementation of `Noise Protocol\nFramework <http://www.noiseprotocol.org/>`__.\n\nWarning\n~~~~~~~\n\nThis package shall not be used (yet) for production purposes. There was\nlittle to none peer review done so far. Use common sense while using -\nuntil this package becomes stable.\n\nInstallation and prerequisites\n------------------------------\n\nFor now, only Python 3.6 is supported.\n\nInstall via pip:\n\n::\n\n    pip install noiseprotocol \n\n*noiseprotocol* depends on\n`Cryptography <https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/>`__ package (and\nits' pre-packaged OpenSSL v1.1) as a source of crypto-primitives.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nBasic usage\n^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nNoiseBuilder class provides highest level of abstraction for the\npackage. You can access full functionality of the package through this\nclass' interfaces. An example for setting up NoiseBuilder could look\nlike this:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from noise.builder import NoiseBuilder\n\n    # Create instance of NoiseBuilder, set up to use NN handshake pattern, Curve25519 for \n    # elliptic curve keypair, ChaCha20Poly1305 as cipher function and SHA256 for hashing.  \n    proto = NoiseBuilder.from_name('Noise_NN_25519_ChaChaPoly_SHA256')\n\n    # Set role in this connection as initiator\n    proto.set_as_initiator()\n    # Enter handshake mode\n    proto.start_handshake()\n\n    # Perform handshake - as we are the initiator, we need to generate first message. \n    # We don't provide any payload (although we could, but it would be cleartext for this pattern).\n    message = proto.write_message()\n    # Send the message to the responder - you may simply use sockets or any other way \n    # to exchange bytes between communicating parties. \n    # For clarity - we omit socket creation in this example.\n    sock.send(message)\n    # Receive the message from the responder \n    received = sock.recv()\n    # Feed the received message into noise\n    payload = proto.read_message(received)\n\n    # As of now, the handshake should be finished (as we are using NN pattern). \n    # Any further calls to write_message or read_message would raise NoiseHandshakeError exception.\n    # We can use encrypt/decrypt methods of NoiseBuilder now for encryption and decryption of messages.\n    encrypted_message = proto.encrypt('This is an example payload')\n\n    ciphertext = sock.recv()\n    plaintext = proto.decrypt(ciphertext)\n\nWireguard integration example\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIn *examples* directory, there is an example of interoperation of this\npackage with Wireguard VPN solution. Please refer to\n`README.md <examples/wireguard/README.md>`__ of that example for\ndetails.\n\n--------------\n\nBug reports\n-----------\n\nThis software was tested only on Linux. It may or may not work on\nWindows, explicit support for this system will be added in future.\n\nPlease file any bug reports in project's `issue\ntracker <https://github.com/plizonczyk/noiseprotocol/issues>`__.\n\nDevelopment & contributing\n--------------------------\n\nThe only additional package that may be useful during development is\npytest - for unit testing. Installation:\n\n::\n\n    pip install pytest\n\nRunning tests (from root directory):\n\n::\n\n    pytest\n\nTodo-list for the project:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  [ ] fallback patterns support\n-  [ ] documentation on Read the Docs and more extensive readme\n-  [ ] scripts for keypair generation (+ console entry points)\n-  [ ] \"echo\" (noise-c like) example\n-  [ ] extensive logging\n-  [ ] bringing back Python 3.5 support and supporting Python 3.7\n   (dependent on Cryptography package updates)\n-  [ ] move away from custom ed448 implementation\n-  [ ] implement countermeasures for side-channel attacks\n-  [ ] **get peer review of the code**\n\nYou are more than welcome to propose new things to this list and/or\nimplement them and file a merge request.\n\nContact the author: plizonczyk.public [at] gmail.com\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the\n`LICENSE <LICENSE>`__ file for details.",
