    "description": "gFlex\n=====\n\n***Multiple methods to solve elastic plate flexure, designed for\napplications to Earth's lithosphere.***\n\nThese instructions are meant to take an user familiar with computers but\nnew to (or a beginner with) Python through the basics of how to get\ngFlex to work. The Python scripting part towards the end should be\npretty straightforward as well, insofar as information is provided on\nhow to get and set the chosen values inside gFlex. *Please leave a\nmessage if you have trouble working with gFlex; your comments could\nassist both you and the more general improvement of this documentation.*\n\nWhen you use gFlex, please cite:\n\n**Wickert, A. D.: `Open-source modular solutions for flexural isostasy:\ngFlex\nv1.0 <http://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/8/4245/2015/gmdd-8-4245-2015.html>`__,\nGeosci. Model Dev. Discuss., 8, 4245-4292, doi:10.5194/gmdd-8-4245-2015,\n2015.**\n\nDownload and Installation\n-------------------------\n\nPython\n^^^^^^\n\ngFlex has been tested on **Python 2.7**, and should work (with a few\npossible changes) on future versions of Python 2.X. It has not been\ntested on Python 3.X.\n\nIn order to run properly, gFlex requires the following Python\ndependencies: \\* numpy \\* scipy \\* matplotlib \\* setuptools \\* pip\n(optional)\n\n*For users who are new to Python, follow these directions to install the\nPython interpreters onto your computer.*\n\nLinux\n     \n\nUse your package manager to download and install the required Python\npackages. For Debian/Ubuntu, it will be something like:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    # Basic packages\n    sudo apt-get install \\\n    python python-numpy python-scipy \\\n    python-setuptools python-matplotlib \n\n    # pip (recommended for automatic installs via setuptools)\n    sudo apt-get install python-pip\n\n    # iPython console -- very useful (optional)\n    sudo apt-get install ipython\n\n    # Sypder IDE (I don't personally use it but many others like it: optional)\n    sudo apt-get install spyder\n\nWindows\n       \n\nDownload\n`**python(x,y)** <https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/wiki/Downloads>`__\nor another full-featured distribution such as **Anaconda**; both of\nthese distributions have been tested successfully with gFlex.\nPython(x,y) and several others also contain the required packages\n(including the numerical libraries), the iPython console, and the Spyder\nIDE; `**Spyder** <https://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/>`__ is a nice IDE\nthat will provide a familiar-looking interface for users accustomed to\nMatlab.\n\nMac\n   \n\nThe current recommendation is to use a package manager like\n`**homebrew** <http://brew.sh/>`__. With this you can install Python,\nand then move on to using **pip** (or **homebrew**) to install the\nPython modules. A good introduction to this can be found here:\nhttp://www.thisisthegreenroom.com/2011/installing-python-numpy-scipy-matplotlib-and-ipython-on-lion.\nSee the **Linux** instructions for the list of packages that you will\nneed; after installing pip, these commands can be substituted as\nfollows, e.g.,\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    # Homebrew\n    sudo brew install python-numpy\n    # Pip\n    pip install numpy\n\nRecent efforts to download Python distributions (both **Anaconda** and\n**Enthought**) have not met with success with both gFlex and GRASS,\nthough **Anaconda** has been tested successfully with Windows. As a\nresult, it should be more successful to keep the Python packages managed\nbetter by something like **homebrew** with **pip**.\n\nSetuptools and ez\\_setup (Windows and Mac with distributions)\n'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''\n\nThe distributions for Mac and Windows do not come with setuptools, which\nis required to install gFlex. However, if you install ez\\_setup, the\ngFlex install script will automatically install setuptools for you.\nSimply type:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip install ez_setup # Windows or Mac without special privileges required\n    sudo pip install ez_setup # Mac where sudo privileges are required\n\nOf course, one can also bypass the need for the install script to\ninstall setuptools by using pip preemptively:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip install setuptools # Windows or Mac without special privileges required\n    sudo pip install setuptools # Mac where sudo privileges are required\n\ngFlex\n^^^^^\n\nDownloading and Installing in One Step from PyPI using pip\n''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''\n\ngFlex is downloadable from the Python Package Index\n(`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`__); see\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/gFlex.\n\nIf you have **pip**, you may simply type:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip install \n    pip install gflex\n    # Or if the destination install folder requires sudo access\n    # (for UNIX-like systems)\n    sudo pip install gflex\n    # pip install gFlex works too -- install is caps-insensitive\n\nand you will have a full, running copy of the latest release version of\ngFlex.\n\nDownloading\n'''''''''''\n\ngFlex may be downloaded here at GitHub, by either: \\* Copying the link\nat right and pasting it into the command prompt as follows:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    git clone <LINK>\n\n-  Downloading and extracting the compressed ZIP file (link at right)\n-  Clicking on the link to add gFlex to your local GitHub desktop app\n   (for Windows or Mac)\n\nInstalling\n==========\n\nInstall gFlex at the command prompt using\n`setuptools <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`__. If you have\nadministrator privileges, which *is often also the case when doing this\ninstall under Windows*, you may drop the \"sudo\". For standard Linux or\nMac users, the \"sudo\" will remain necessary, and you will have to enter\nyour administrator password for the program to be added to your local\nset of applications (e.g., as \"/usr/local/bin/gflex\").\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    # For standard Linux/Mac users:\n    sudo python setup.py install\n    # OR\n    sudo python setup.py develop # If you want the install to see instantly\n                                 # any changes made in the source repository\n\n    # For Windows users or Unix-type users with SuperUser privileges:\n    python setup.py install\n    # OR\n    python setup.py develop # If you want the install to see instantly\n                            # any changes made in the source repository\n\nRunning\n-------\n\nOnce gFlex is installed, it is possible to run it in four ways: 1. With\na configuration file 2. Within a Python script 3. Within GRASS GIS 4. As\npart of the Landlab Earth-surface modeling framework, including an\ninterface to the the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System\n`Component Model Interface\n(CMI) <http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/CMI_Description>`__\n\nFor options 1 and 2, there are pre-built methods that can be selected\nalong the way to visualize results. These use Python's Matplotlib\nplotting library. For option 3, GRASS GIS is used for visualization. In\nOption 4, output from Landlab can be visualized with Matplotlib, and\noutput from CSDMS sets of models can be visualized using tools such as\n`VisIt <https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/>`__\n(`CSDMS page about\nVisIt <http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/CMT_visualization>`__) and\n`ParaView <http://www.paraview.org/>`__. ParaView also now has `Python\nbindings <http://www.paraview.org/python/>`__, which can further be used\nto visualize outputs produced with any of these methods.\n\nWith configuration file\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nA configuration file can be generated to run gFlex; see examples in the\n**input/** directory. To run gFlex using this file, one simply opens a\nterminal window and types:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    # run like this:\n    gflex <path-to-configuration-file>\n\nFor help constructing configuration files, see the blank template files\n**input/template1D** and **input/template2D**, as well as the other\nexamples found in the **input/** directory. The **input/** directory\nalso contains **input/README.md**, which provides a further local\ndescription of the files available. **input/input\\_help** provides a\nlonger explanation of what the parameters are, and is therefore\nreproduced immediately below for reference:\n\n.. code:: lisp\n\n    ; input_help\n    ; All units are SI.

When you install it\n(above), this also produces a Python module that you may import to\naccess it while scripting.\n\nWith no configuration file (recommended)\n''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''\n\n**input/run\\_in\\_script\\_2D.py**, reproduced below, is a good example of\nhow to set the variables and run the model. This method requires no\ninput file, as all of the values are set inside the Python script that\nimports gflex. This is essentially how the GRASS GIS interface was\nwritten, and is a way to embed the abilities of gFlex into another\nmodel. A one-dimensional example, **input/run\\_in\\_script\\_1D.py**, is\nalso available.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    #! /usr/bin/env python\n\n    import gflex\n    import numpy as np\n    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n\n    flex = gflex.F2D()\n\n    flex.Quiet = False\n\n    flex.Method = 'FD' # Solution method: * FD (finite difference)\n                       #                  * SAS (superposition of analytical solutions)\n                       #                  * SAS_NG (ungridded SAS)\n    flex.PlateSolutionType = 'vWC1994' # van Wees and Cloetingh (1994)\n                                       # The other option is 'G2009': Govers et al.

Defaults False.\n    #PlanetaryRadius = # radius of planet [m], for lat/lon solutions\n\n    flex.initialize()\n    flex.run()\n    flex.finalize()\n\n    # If you want to plot the output\n    flex.plotChoice='both'\n    # An output file for deflections could also be defined here\n    # flex.wOutFile = \n    flex.output() # Plots and/or saves output, or does nothing, depending on\n                  # whether flex.plotChoice and/or flex.wOutFile have been set\n    # TO OBTAIN OUTPUT DIRECTLY IN PYTHON, you can assign the internal variable,\n    # flex.w, to another variable -- or as an element in a list if you are looping\n    # over many runs of gFlex:\n    deflection = flex.w\n\nWith a configuration file\n'''''''''''''''''''''''''\n\nIf you would like to use a Python script with a configuration file, this\nis also possible.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import gflex\n\n    # To use a configuration file:\n    filename = '../gflex/input/input_f1d_test' # it works for usage (1) and (2)\n    obj = gflex.WhichModel(filename)\n\n    ## SET MODEL TYPE AND DIMENSIONS HERE ##\n    ########################################\n    if obj.dimension == 1:\n      obj = gflex.F1D(filename)\n    elif obj.dimension == 2:\n      obj = gflex.F2D(filename)\n\n    # Then run the code!\n    obj.initialize(filename)\n    obj.run()\n    obj.finalize()\n\n    # Standalone plotting output if you so desire\n    flex.plotChoice='w'\n    obj.output()\n\nWithin GRASS GIS\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nTo run gFlex inside of GRASS GIS 7, run the following commands from\nwithin a GRASS GIS session:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    g.extension r.flexure\n    g.extension v.flexure\n\nThis will reach into the GRASS GIS subversion repository, download the\nsource code, and install the packages. **r.flexure** is used for raster\ngrids by either finite difference or analytical methods. **v.flexure**\ntakes advantage of the ungridded analytical method to solve for flexure\nat an aribtrary set of load points, albeit limited to cases with\nconstant elastic thickness. These are stored at and have help files\nlocated at, respectively:\n\n-  **r.flexure**\n-  Source:\n   http://trac.osgeo.org/grass/browser/grass-addons/grass7/raster/r.flexure\n-  Manual page (HTML):\n   http://grass.osgeo.org/grass70/manuals/addons/r.flexure.html\n-  **v.flexure**\n-  Source:\n   http://trac.osgeo.org/grass/browser/grass-addons/grass7/vector/v.flexure\n-  Manual page (HTML):\n   http://grass.osgeo.org/grass70/manuals/addons/v.flexure.html\n\nWhen running **r.flexure**, it is important to ensure that the elastic\nthickness map is at or properly interpolated to the computational region\n(**g.region**) resolution before solving. A nearest-neighbor\ninterpolated Te map will cause perceived gradients in elastic thickness\nto be very sharp, and this will strongly affect (and misdirect) the\nflexural solutions.\n\nAs part of Landlab and the CSDMS CMI\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nLandlab is an in-development (but nearing release) Earth-surface\nmodeling framework built to facilitate easy integration of geomorphic,\necological, hydrological, geological, etc. Earth-surface related models\nto simulate and investigate the links between multiple processes. gFlex\ncan be linked with Landlab, and the code to do this is available within\nthe Landlab repository at\nhttps://github.com/landlab/landlab/tree/master/landlab/components/gFlex.\n\nThe Landlab interface to gFlex also provides gFlex with the Community\nSurface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) `Component Model Interface\n(CMI) <http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/CMI_Description>`__ interface.\nThis allows it to be run as a coupled component across multiple\nprogramming languages and paradigms as part of the CSDMS community of\nmodels. For more information on model coupling with CSDMS, see the\nexample presentation at\nhttp://csdms.colorado.edu/w/images/CSDMS\\_lecture7.pdf and the paper on\nthe model coupling published by `Peckham et al., \"A component-based\napproach to integrated modeling in the geosciences: The design of\nCSDMS\" <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300412001252>`__.\n\nUtilities\n---------\n\nThe \"utilities\" folder currently contains only one program,\n``flexural_wavelength_calculator.py``. Operating it is simple and fairly\nrudimentary: just edit the input variables directly in the calculator\nPython file, and then run it to see what the flexural parameter, first\nzero-crossing point (on the load-side of the forebulge), and the\nflexural wavelength.",
