    "description": "Kconfiglib\n==========\n\nA Python library for doing stuff with `Kconfig <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt>`_-based\nconfiguration systems. Can extract information, query and set symbol values,\nand read and write ``.config`` files. Highly compatible with the\n``scripts/kconfig/*conf`` utilities in the kernel, usually invoked via make\ntargets such as ``menuconfig`` and ``defconfig``.\n\nSupports both Python 2 and Python 3 without modification, and should also run\non non-\\*nix platforms\n\n.. contents:: Table of contents\n   :backlinks: none\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstallation with pip\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nKconfiglib is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ and can be\ninstalled with\n\n.. code::\n\n    $ pip(3) install kconfiglib\n\nAll releases have a corresponding tag in the git repository, e.g. ``v1.0.0``.\n`Semantic versioning <http://semver.org/>`_ is used.\n\nInstallation for the Linux kernel\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAfter installing with ``pip(3)``, apply ``makefile.patch``\nby running e.g. the following commands in the kernel root:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n \u00a0  $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ulfalizer/Kconfiglib/master/makefile.patch\n    $ git am makefile.patch\n\nIf you do not wish to install anything, the following manual approach will work as well:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    $ git clone git://github.com/ulfalizer/Kconfiglib.git  \n    $ git am Kconfiglib/makefile.patch\n\n(Warning: The directory name ``Kconfiglib/`` is significant in this case, because it's added to ``PYTHONPATH`` by the new targets in ``makefile.patch``.)\n\nIn addition to creating a handy interface, the make targets created by the\npatch (``scriptconfig`` and ``iscriptconfig``) are needed to pick up environment\nvariables set in the kernel makefiles and later referenced in the Kconfig files\n(``ARCH``, ``SRCARCH``, and ``KERNELVERSION`` as of Linux v4.14.0-rc1).\nThe documentation explains how the make targets are used. The compatibility\ntests in the test suite also needs them.\n\nPlease tell me if the patch does not apply. It should be trivial to apply\nmanually, as it's just a block of text that needs to be inserted near the other\n``*conf:`` targets.\n\nManual installation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe entire library is contained in\n`kconfiglib.py <https://github.com/ulfalizer/Kconfiglib/blob/master/kconfiglib.py>`_.\nJust drop it somewhere.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe (extensive) documentation is generated by running the following command in the same\ndirectory as ``kconfiglib.py``:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    $ pydoc kconfiglib\n\nFor HTML output, use\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    $ pydoc -w kconfiglib\n\nYou could also browse the docstrings directly in\n`kconfiglib.py <https://github.com/ulfalizer/Kconfiglib/blob/master/kconfiglib.py>`_.\n\nPlease tell me if something is unclear to you or can be explained better. The Kconfig\nlanguage has some dark corners.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n* The `examples/ <https://github.com/ulfalizer/Kconfiglib/tree/master/examples>`_ directory contains simple example scripts. See the documentation for how to run them.\n\n* `genboardscfg.py <http://git.denx.de/?p=u-boot.git;a=blob;f=tools/genboardscfg.py;hb=HEAD>`_ from `Das U-Boot <http://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot>`_ generates some sort of legacy board database by pulling information from a newly added Kconfig-based configuration system (as far as I understand it :).\n\n* `gen-manual-lists.py <https://git.busybox.net/buildroot/tree/support/scripts/gen-manual-lists.py?id=5676a2deea896f38123b99781da0a612865adeb0>`_ generated listings for an appendix in the `Buildroot <https://buildroot.org>`_ manual. (The listing has since been removed.)\n\n* `SConf <https://github.com/CoryXie/SConf>`_ builds an interactive configuration interface (like ``menuconfig``) on top of Kconfiglib, for use e.g. with `SCons <scons.org>`_.\n\n* `kconfig-diff.py <https://gist.github.com/dubiousjim/5638961>`_ -- a script by `dubiousjim <https://github.com/dubiousjim>`_ that compares kernel configurations.\n\n* Originally, Kconfiglib was used in chapter 4 of my `master's thesis <http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:473038/FULLTEXT01.pdf>`_ to automatically generate a \"minimal\" kernel for a given system. Parts of it bother me a bit now, but that's how it goes with old work.\n\nTest suite\n----------\n\nThe test suite is run with\n\n.. code::\n\n    $ python(3) Kconfiglib/testsuite.py\n\nIt must be run from the top-level kernel directory, and require that the git repository has\nbeen cloned into it and ``makefile.patch`` applied.\n\n**NOTE: Some tests currently overwrite .config in the kernel root, so make sure to back it up.**\n\nThe test suite consists of a set of selftests and a set of compatibility tests that\ncompare (character for character) configurations generated by Kconfiglib with\nconfigurations generated by ``scripts/kconfig/conf`` for a number of cases. You\nmight want to use the \"speedy\" option; see\n`testsuite.py <https://github.com/ulfalizer/Kconfiglib/blob/master/testsuite.py>`_.\n\nThe test suite might fail for a few configurations for kernels older than April 2006,\nwhen a fix was added to Kconfig that's also mirrored in Kconfiglib\n(see `this commit <https://github.com/ulfalizer/Kconfiglib/commit/35ea8d5f1d63bdc9f8642f5ce4445e8f7c914385>`_).\nThis is harmless, and only counts as a fail since the test suite compares literal\noutput from the kconfig version that's bundled with the kernel.\n\nKconfiglib is much faster than the test suite would indicate. Most of the time\nis spent waiting around for ``make`` or the C utilities. Adding some multiprocessing\nto the test suite would make sense.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* **Useful information can be extracted from internal data structures.** The\n  expression format is pretty simple for example: ``A && B && (!C || D == 3)`` is\n  represented as the tuple structure\n  ``(AND, A, (AND, B, (OR, (NOT, C), (EQUAL, D, 3))))``; see the\n  ``Config._parse_expr()`` docstring.\n\n  It's hard to come up with good APIs for dealing with expressions given how\n  general they are, so feel free to look at them directly if none of the\n  exposed APIs will suffice (modifying them is dangerous though, because it\n  breaks dependency tracking). Maybe I'll officially document the expression\n  format and add a bunch of accessors later. The internal format is unlikely\n  to change in either case, and would probably be returned directly.\n\n  If you come up with some good generally-usable APIs involving\n  expressions, please tell me. Make sure they also make sense for expressions\n  involving ``||`` (or) and ``!`` (not).\n\n* Kconfiglib works well with `PyPy <http://pypy.org>`_. It gives a nice speedup\n  over CPython when batch processing a large number of configurations (like\n  the test suite does).\n\n* Kconfiglib assumes the modules symbol is ``MODULES`` and will warn if\n  ``option modules`` is set on some other symbol. Let me know if this is a\n  problem for you. Adding proper ``option modules`` support should be pretty\n  easy.\n\n* At least two things make it awkward to replicate a ``menuconfig``-like\n  interface in Kconfiglib at the moment (but see\n  `SConf <https://github.com/CoryXie/SConf>`_, as mentioned above).\n\n  * There are no good APIs for figuring out what other symbols change in value\n    when the value of some symbol is changed, to allow for \"live\" updates\n    in the configuration interface. The simplest workaround is to refetch the\n    value of each currently visible symbol every time a symbol value is\n    changed.\n\n  * ``menuconfig`` sometimes creates cosmetic menus implicitly by looking at\n    dependencies. For example, a list of symbols where all symbols depend on\n    the first symbol creates a cosmetic menu rooted at the first symbol.\n    Recreating such menus is awkward.\n\n    There is already basic support internally though, because it's needed to\n    get obscure choice behavior right. See ``_determine_actual_symbols()`` and\n    its helper ``_has_auto_menu_dep_on()``.\n\n* Using `__slots__ <https://docs.python.org/3.1/reference/datamodel.html#slots>`_\n  on classes would speed things up a bit and save memory. It'd remove some\n  flexibility though.\n\n* `fpemud <https://github.com/fpemud>`_ has put together\n  `Python bindings <https://github.com/fpemud/pylkc>`_ to internal functions in the C\n  implementation. This is an alternative to Kconfiglib's all-Python approach.\n\n* The test suite failures (should be the only ones) for the following Blackfin\n  defconfigs on e.g. Linux 3.7.0-rc8 are due to\n  [a bug in the C implementation](https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/5/458):\n\n  * ``arch/blackfin/configs/CM-BF537U_defconfig``\n  * ``arch/blackfin/configs/BF548-EZKIT_defconfig``\n  * ``arch/blackfin/configs/BF527-EZKIT_defconfig``\n  * ``arch/blackfin/configs/BF527-EZKIT-V2_defconfig``\n  * ``arch/blackfin/configs/TCM-BF537_defconfig``\n\nThanks\n------\n\nThanks to `Philip Craig <https://github.com/philipc>`_ for adding\nsupport for the ``allnoconfig_y`` option and fixing an obscure issue\nwith ``comment``\\s inside ``choice``\\s (that didn't affect correctness but\nmade outputs differ). ``allnoconfig_y`` is used to force certain symbols\nto ``y`` during ``make allnoconfig`` to improve coverage.\n\n\n",
