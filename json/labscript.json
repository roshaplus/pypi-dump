    "description": "Part of the labscript suite, the labscript Python library provides a translation from simple Python code to complex hardware instructions. The library is used to construct a \"connection table\" containing information about what hardware is being used and how it is interconnected. Devices described in this connection table can then have their outputs set by using a range of functions, including arbitrary ramps.",
