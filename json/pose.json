    "description": "Pose started as a python based image gallery utilizing the Pylons framework.\n\nSince that time, Pose has evolved into a more general purpose content management system based on the Pylons framework.  It utilizes the OSBrowser module as an interface to the local filesystem being served by Pose.  OSBrowser is essentially the model in terms of MVC. In this way, Pose could be considered a web based filesytem browser.\n\nPose should allow you to quickly organize a collection of data into a structure and see how that structure will work.  Then, as custom functionality is needed, Pylons is right there to adapt the system to your needs.\n\nPose now includes tiny_mce, a few open source flash based audio players, and S5 rendering javascripts in the public directory.",
