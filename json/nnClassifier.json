    "description": "# nnClassify\nCommand line tool for classifying images\n\n Toxicology \u2013 the branch of science concerned with the nature,\n effects, and detection of poisons \u2013 has \n traditionally relied on expensive mammalian studies.\n However, due to the large number of environmental\n toxins that need testing, less expensive, high \n throughput alternatives are required. Planaria \u2013 a small \n asexual flatworm \u2013 provide an inexpensive and scalable\n solution. The small size of planaria not only makes\n them inexpensive to maintain, but also easy to \n image with a high-resolution camera. Researchers can\n run many test simultaneously, record the planarias\n reaction, and use computer vision techniques to \n analyze the results in a cost-effect and timely manner.\n The results of some of these tests can be analyzed\n using traditional computer vision techniques;\n however, many tests involve classifying features of the\n planaria \u2013 such as their body shape or eyes \u2013 as\n normal or abnormal. Deep convolutional neural\n networks have achieved state of the art results on image\n classification tasks, but they require a large training\n set of images. Researchers do not have the time\n or resources to hand-label sufficient images for this\n technique to be effective. Using transfer-learning, we\n have developed a software platform for researchers to\n quickly classify images with near state-of-the-art\n performance and minimal training data.",
