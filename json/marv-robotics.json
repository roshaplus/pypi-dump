    "description": "MARV Robotics (beta)\n====================\n\nMARV Robotics is an extensible data management platform for robot logs. New robot logs are found by a scanner and configured nodes are run to extract, filter and process data from them.\n\nThe robot logs are visualized in a web-based application that features a listing view with filters and summary, and detail views of individual log files.\n\nSo far MARV Robotics supports the Robot Operating System (ROS) Bag format used by systems running ROS to record sensor data and system state.\n\n\nRobot Operating System (ROS)\n----------------------------\n\nMARV Robotics is meant to support all alive ROS releases. Currently these are indigo, jade, and kinetic -- if you encounter difficulties, please report back!\n\nMARV Robotics is implemented in Python using the MARV framework. Most of its Python dependencies will be installed by pip automatically. Apart from these on an Ubuntu system the following are needed (as root). In case you succeeded installing ROS on anything else than Ubuntu, we trust you'll also succeed to transfer the following lines to the system you are installing to.\n\n\nIndigo\n^^^^^^\n\nFor indigo on Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty), first make sure you have the latest Python 2.7 version installed::\n\n  # apt-get install software-properties-common\n  # add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes-python2.7\n  # apt-get update\n  # apt-get upgrade\n\nThen install the requirements::\n\n  # apt-get install curl \\\n                    ros-indigo-ros-base \\\n                    ros-indigo-cv-bridge \\\n                    libffi-dev \\\n                    python2.7-dev \\\n                    python-opencv \\\n                    python-virtualenv \\\n                    libjpeg-dev \\\n                    libz-dev\n  ...\n  # rosdep init\n\nMake sure ROS is set-up correctly for your user (not as root)::\n\n  $ rosdep update\n  $ source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash\n\nKinetic\n^^^^^^^\n::\n\n  # apt-get install curl \\\n                    ros-kinetic-ros-base \\\n                    python-cv-bridge \\\n                    python2.7-dev \\\n                    python-opencv \\\n                    python-virtualenv \\\n                    libjpeg-dev \\\n                    libz-dev\n  ...\n  # rosdep init\n\nMake sure ROS is set-up correctly for your user (not as root)::\n\n  $ rosdep update\n  $ source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash\n\n  \nInstallation\n------------\n\nWhile strictly speaking a virtual Python environment is not necessary and MARV Robotics installs fine without, we highly recommend it.  For instructions to install into your user's home instead, see below.\n\nOption 1: Virtual Python Environment (recommended)\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nCreate a virtual environment and activate it::\n\n  $ virtualenv -p python2.7 --system-site-packages venv\n  $ source venv/bin/activate\n  $ pip install -U pip setuptools\n\nTest whether ROS is available from within the activated virtualenv. The ``(venv)`` prefix indicates the activated virtualenv::\n\n  (venv) $ python -c 'import rosbag; print(\"rosbag available\")'\n  rosbag available\n\nFor more information on virtualenvs see `Virtual Environments\n<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_.\n\nInstall MARV Robotics::\n\n  (venv) $ pip install -U marv-robotics\n  ...\n\nTo install the latest pre-release, add ``--pre``::\n\n  (venv) $ pip install -U --pre marv-robotics\n  ...\n\nVerify MARV Robotics is successfully installed::\n\n  (venv) $ marv --help\n\n``marv --help`` should print marv's usage instructions. In the following sections we assume that your virtualenv is activated. If ``marv`` cannot be found, chances are that the virtualenv containing MARV Robotics is not activated.\n\nOption 2: User install\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nAn alternative to install into an isolated virtualenv (see above) is to install into the user's ``$HOME/.local`` folder where MARV Robotics might interfere with other installed programs. First check whether ``$HOME/.local/bin`` is in ``$PATH`` and ``$HOME/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages`` in ``$PYTHONPATH``::\n\n  $ echo $PATH\n  $ echo $PYTHONPATH\n\nand add if needed::\n\n  $ export PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"\n  $ export PYTHONPATH=\"$HOME/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH\"\n\nVerify that ROS is still available::\n\n  $ python -c 'import rosbag; print(\"rosbag available\")'\n  rosbag available\n\nInstall MARV Robotics and verify it is available by printing its usage instructions::\n\n  $ pip install --user marv-robotics\n  ...\n  $ marv --help\n  ...\n\nBy now MARV Robotics should be successfully installed.\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nAfter having successfully installed MARV Robotics, we can initialize a site that is going to hold configuration files and databases::\n\n  (venv) $ marv init ./site\n  Path to scanroot containing bags: /scanroot\n  Application root for MARV, if not at root of domain []: \n  Wrote config file site/marv.conf\n  Wrote site/wsgi.py\n  Wrote site/uwsgi.conf\n\nFirst marv will prompt for the scanroot, the location of your bag files. By default MARV Robotics is expected to be served at the root of a domain (e.g. http://localhost:8000/), specify an application root to server e.g. at ``/marv-robotics`` instead.\n\nTake a look at the generated ``marv.conf``, it contains many comments and aims to compensate for the current lack of documentation.\n\n**If your bags are dear to you, you should keep them read-only for the user running marv, write-access to anything within the scanroot is not needed and discouraged.**\n\nIf not specified otherwise, marv looks for the config file in the current directory, a bit like git. Let's changed into the site::\n\n  (venv) $ cd site\n  (venv) ~/site $\n\n\nUser management\n---------------\n\nIn order to comment and tag through the web, marv user accounts are needed. The password will be prompted for::\n\n  (venv) ~/site $ marv user add test\n  Password: \n  Repeat for confirmation: \n\nThe currently ensuing gibberish can be safely ignored.\n\nPasswords are changed with::\n\n  (venv) ~/site $ marv user pw test\n  Password: \n  Repeat for confirmation:\n\n\nStart webserver\n---------------\n\nMARV Robotics is implemented as a Python WSGI application. To serve it a WSGI server is needed, e.g. uWSGI. A configuration file was created previously by ``marv init`` within the marv site::\n\n  (venv) ~/site $ pip install uwsgi\n  ...\n  (venv) ~/site $ uwsgi --ini uwsgi.conf\n\nBy now you should be able to visit your MARV Robotics installation with a web browser at http://localhost:8000/. So far no filesets have been scanned.\n\n\nScanning filesets and running nodes\n-----------------------------------\n\nThrough scanning the scanroot marv detects new and changed filesets::\n\n  (venv) ~/site $ marv fileset scan\n  ...\n\nReloading your browser page should give you a list with detected filesets. Instead of proper names, UUIDs are displayed and there is not much to see yet in the detail view. However, when signed-in you could start to tag and comment already.\n\nIn general all ``*.bag`` files found in the scanroot are added. If you want ignore certain subtrees, add a ``.marvignore`` file::\n\n  # touch /scanroot/ignored/.marvignore\n\nIn order to get more catchy names to be displayed for your bag sets, run the ``bagset_name`` node::\n\n  (venv) ~/site $ marv node run --all-filesets --node bagset_name\n\nand reload your browser. A list of nodes is produced by::\n\n  (venv) ~/site $ marv node list\n\nor simply run all configured nodes::\n\n  (venv) ~/site $ marv node run --all-filesets --all-nodes\n\n\nIntegration with other tools\n----------------------------\n\nMARV Robotics integrates well with other tools through its `json api <http://jsonapi.org/>`_. To query all filesets having \"gps\" in their name use::\n\n  $ curl -G -H \"Accept: application/vnd.api+json\" \\\n      http://localhost:8000/marv/api/2/listing \\\n      -d 'filter[objects]=[{\"name\":\"name\",\"op\":\"like\",\"val\":\"%gps%\"}]'\n\nor with python requests::\n\n  import requests\n  import json\n\n  url = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/marv/api/2/listing'\n  headers = {'Accept': 'application/vnd.api+json'}\n\n  filters = [dict(name='name', op='like', val='%gps%')]\n  params = {'filter[objects]': json.dumps(filters)}\n\n  response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers=headers)\n  assert response.status_code == 200\n  print(response.json())\n\nFor more information see `flask-restless docs <http://flask-restless.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.0b1/fetching.html>`_, which is also the base for these examples.\n\n\nRun tests and coverage\n----------------------\n\nSo far MARV ships with some tests and more will follow for MARV and MARV Robotics before the final 2.0.0. release. You can simply run the tests::\n\n  (venv) $ nosetests venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/{marv,marv_robotics}\n\nor produce a coverage report::\n\n  (venv) $ nosetests --with-coverage \\\n                     --cover-branches \\\n                     --cover-erase \\\n                     --cover-html \\\n                     --cover-package marv \\\n                     --cover-package marv-robotics \\\n                     --cover-tests \\\n                     venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/{marv,marv_robotics}\n  (venv) $ chromium cover/index.html\n\n**You should not run these within your site directory**\n\n\nLicensing\n---------\n\nMARV Robotics is built using the MARV framework.
