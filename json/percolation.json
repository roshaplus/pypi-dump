    "description": "==================================================================\nPercolate your social systems\n==================================================================\n\nPercolation unites Gmane, Participation, Social and MASS packages to enable anthropological physics experiments and social harnessing. Core features are:  \n\n    - Ease percolation in social systems by processes such as collection and diffusion of information.\n\n    - Enable knowledge about the networked self.\n\n    - Make abstract animations from social data.                      \n\n    - Make music from social data to fit animation as soundtrack.\n\n    - Verification of expected stability and differentiation on the social structures.\n\n    - Directions for agents and networks typologies, extending features from Gmane package.\n\n    - Integration of resources through RDF data and OWL ontologies.  \n\n    - Routines for representing data from social networks (tweets, Facebook data, IRC logs, LinkedIn, Gmane lists) as RDF.\n\n    - Cross provenance resource recommendation, extending facilities from the Participation package.\n\n    - Generation of activity reports.                                 \n\n\nUsage example\n=================\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import percolation as P\n\n    # Use participation, social, gmane and mass\n    # to explore your social systems.\n\n    # more ***under construction***\n    # Enjoy!",
