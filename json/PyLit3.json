    "description": "This is a small rewrite of PyLit to make it work for Python3.\r\n\r\n*Literate programming* is the combination of documentation and source together in a fashion suited for reading by human beings.\r\n\r\nPyLit supports two-way translation between RST and Python.\r\n\r\n- From Python to RST-based markup to create good-looking documentation from Python programs.\r\n\r\n- From RST markup to Python to create Python code from human-friendly documentation files.\r\n\r\nGiven the RST markup files, Docutils or Sphinx can be used to finalize the documentation.",
