    "description": "The Molecular Modelling Toolkit (MMTK) is an Open Source program\nlibrary for molecular simulation applications. In addition to providing\nready-to-use implementations of standard algorithms, MMTK serves as a\ncode basis that can be easily extended and modified to deal with\nstandard and non-standard problems in molecular simulations.",
