You have the\n  option to create a vendor bill or a refund. In the bill or refund the\n  correct quantity will be proposed, based on those fields.\n\n* Billed Quantity and Refunded Quantity, as separate fields.\n\n* Received Quantity and Returned Quantity, as separate fields.\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nCase 1: When you return to a supplier some products, and you have not yet\nreceived the bill from the supplier\n\n#. Go to *Purchases > Purchase > Purchase Orders > Create*.\n#. Choose a supplier and add a product whose *Control Purchase Bills* is *On\n   received quantities*, and input some quantity to purchase.\n#. Confirm the purchase order.\n#. Go to *Shipment > Validate > Apply* so as to receive the quantities ordered.\n#. Press the button *Reverse*.\n#. In the wizard *Reverse Quantity* Set *Quantity* to the quantity to be\n   returned. Press *Return* to complete the wizard.\n#. On the return picking press *Validate > Apply*.\n#. Go back to the purchase order. You will notice that the field *Returned\n   Qty* is now the quantity that was returned. The field *Quantity to\n   Bill* will show the quantity received less the quantity returned.\n#. Press the button *Invoices* to create the vendor bill.\n#. The proposed vendor bill will be proposed for the difference between the\n   received and the returned quantity.\n\nCase 2: When you return to a supplier some products, and you have already\nreceived a bill from the supplier.\n\n#. Go to *Purchases > Purchase > Purchase Orders > Create*.\n#. Choose a supplier and add a product whose *Control Purchase Bills* is *On\n   received quantities*, and input some quantity to purchase.\n#. Confirm the purchase order.\n#. Go to *Shipment > Validate > Apply* so as to receive the quantities ordered.\n#. Press the button *Invoices* to create the vendor bill.\n#. The proposed vendor bill will be proposed for the quantity received. The\n   *Invoice Status* is now 'Invoiced'\n#. Go to the original incoming shipment\n#. Press the button *Reverse*.\n#. In the wizard *Reverse Quantity* Set *Quantity* to the quantity to be\n   returned. Press *Return* to complete the wizard.\n#. On the return picking press *Validate > Apply*.\n#. Go back to the purchase order. It will have  *Invoice Status* as 'Waiting\n   Invoices'. You will notice that the field *Returned Qty* is now the quantity\n   that was returned. The field *Quantity to Refund* is now the showing the\n   quantity returned that was previously billed.\n#. Press the button *Refunds* to create the vendor refund bill (since the\n   field *Quantity to Invoice* is negative).\n#. The proposed vendor refund bill will be proposed for the quantity that is\n   to be refunded.\n#. If you back to the purchase order, you will notice that *Invoice Status*\n   is now 'Invoiced', even when the quantity ordered does not match with the\n   quantity invoiced, because you did return some products.\n\nRemark: As part of the 3-way match process, if you accept that you will not\nclaim for a refund for the quantity returned to the supplier, just set the\npurchase status as 'Done' at the end of the process, and the quantity to\ninvoice for the items will be set to 0 (because you have accepted the\ndiscrepancies).\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/95/9.0\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* The functionality of return processing with refunds is being discussed with\n  Odoo here: https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/13974, so this addon may not\n  need to be migrated to v10.\n\n* The computation of the quantity invoiced is hacked to overcome an issue in\n  one of the tests of Odoo. See https://github.com/OCA/OCB/pull/598\n\n* The module purchase_stock_picking_return_invoicing_open_qty is a glue module\n  that will be automatically installed in case the purchase_open_qty module is\n  also installed.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/account-invoicing/issues>`_.
