    "description": "![alt text](docs/_static/shwirl_splash.png \"Shwirl\")\n\nAbout shwirl\n=============\n\n**shwirl** is a custom standalone Python program to visualise spectral data cubes with ray-tracing volume rendering.\nThe program has been developed to investigate transfer functions and graphics shaders as enablers for\nscientific visualisation of astronomical data. Details about transfer functions and shaders developed and implemented in\n**shwirl** can be found in a full length article by Vohl, Fluke, Barnes & Hassan (Submitted).\n\nA transfer function is an arbitrary function that combines volumetric elements (or voxels) to set the colour,\nintensity, or transparency level of each pixel in the final image. A graphics shader is an algorithmic kernel\nused to compute several properties of the final image such as colour, depth, and/or transparency.\nShaders are particularly suited to computing transfer functions, and are an integral part of the graphics\npipeline on Graphics Processing Units.\n\nThe program utilises [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org) to handle FITS files and World Coordinate System, \n[Qt](http://www.qtcentre.org) (and [PyQt](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5)) for the user interface,\nand [VisPy](http://vispy.org), an object-oriented Python visualisation library binding onto OpenGL.\nWe implemented the algorithms in the fragment shader using the GLSL language.\n\nThe software has been tested on Linux, Mac, and\nWindows machines, including remote desktop on cloud computing infrastructure. While the software is available for\ndownload and ready to visualise data, this is not intended as a full software release just yet.\nThe open source code allows interested individuals to inspect how custom shaders can be written, and can be a\nstarting point to develop a more generic visualisation and analysis software.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\nDocumentation can be found at [readthedocs](link).\n\nInstallation\n------------\nYou need Qt5, PyQt5, PyOpenGL, and Astropy. Then download **shwirl**'s code. \nSee documentation for more details. \n\nIn a console, type `python3 shwirl.py`. A GUI should show up!\n\nIssues, requests and general inquiries\n--------------------------------------\nPlease send issues, feature requests and/or general inquiries to Dany Vohl via http://macrocosme.github.io/#contact.\n\nLicense\n-------\nshwirl is licensed under the terms of the (new) BSD license. \nA copy of the license is included within this repository.\n\nCopyright\n---------\nCopyright (c) 2015, Dany Vohl\nAll rights reserved.",
