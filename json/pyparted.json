    "description": "pyparted\nPython bindings for libparted\n-----------------------------\n\nOVERVIEW\n\npyparted is a set of native Python bindings for libparted.  libparted is the\nlibrary portion of the GNU parted project.  With pyparted, you can write\napplications that interact with disk partition tables and filesystems.\n\nThe Python bindings are implemented in two layers.  Since libparted itself\nis written in C without any real implementation of objects, a simple 1:1\nmapping of externally accessible libparted functions was written.  This\nmapping is provided in the _ped Python module.  You can use that module if\nyou want to, but it's really just meant for the larger parted module.\n\n    _ped       libparted Python bindings, direct 1:1: function mapping\n    parted     Native Python code building on _ped, complete with classes,\n               exceptions, and advanced functionality.\n\nThe _ped module is written and maintained by hand.  I chose to do this\nrather than rely on a tool like SWIG or Pyrex for several reasons.  Mostly\nbecause I was the GNU parted maintainer, but also because libparted is sort\nof complex.  It's a lowlevel system tool and I found it doesn't translate\nwell in the tools I tried.  This is nothing against those tools, I just\ndon't think libparted is ideal to go through SWIG or Pyrex.  By writing my\nown bindings, I can also find bugs in libparted that I may have overlooked\nbefore.  See the WHY file for more explanation as to why I wrote the\nbindings by hand.\n\n\nHISTORY\n\npyparted started life at Red Hat and continues there today.  The main reason\nfor writing it was to let anaconda (the Red Hat installation program, now\nused by RHEL and Fedora and many other distributions) interact with\nlibparted.  Anaconda is written in Python, so native bindings made sense.\n\npyparted went through many rewrites, but the end result was always the same.\nAnd incomplete API via Python with just enough provided for anaconda to do\nits job.\n\nThe latest iteration of pyparted aims to be a complete API mapping and even\nprovide a nice set of classes so that people might want to integrate it in\nto other installers or even write other applications (maybe a Python based\nalternative to parted(8) or fdisk(8)).\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nExample code is provided in the examples directory.  These may help provide a\ngentle introduction to the usage concepts of pyparted.  More examples are always\nwelcome, as are improved explanatory commentary for those that exist.\n\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nIf you are reporting a pyparted failure in Fedora, it's most useful if\nyou file a bug at http://bugzilla.redhat.com/ against the appropriate\nFedora release you are using.\n\nAlternatively, you can file bugs directly on the project page:\nhttp://fedorahosted.org/pyparted/\n\nIf you just have questions about pyparted, you can email us directly\nusing the contact information in the AUTHORS file.  We will do our best\nto help you.\n",
