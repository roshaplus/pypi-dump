To do it:\n\n#. Go to *Mass Mailing > Configuration > Unsubscription Reasons*.\n#. Create / edit / remove / sort as usual.\n#. If *Details required* is enabled, they will have to fill a text area to\n   continue.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nOnce configured:\n\n#. Go to *Mass Mailing > Mailings > Mass Mailings > Create*.\n#. Edit your mass mailing at wish, but remember to add a snippet from\n   *Footers*, so people have an *Unsubscribe* link.\n#. Send it.\n#. If somebody gets unsubscribed, you will see logs about that under\n   *Mass Mailing > Mailings > Unsubscriptions*.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/205/10.0\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* This module adds a security hash for mass mailing unsubscription URLs, which\n  disables insecure URLs from mass mailing messages sent before its\n  installation. This can be a problem, but anyway you'd get that problem in\n  Odoo 11.0, where https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/12040 was merged, so at\n  least this addon will be forward-compatible with it. So, **this feature must\n  be removed from here when migrating to v11**.\n* This module replaces AJAX submission core implementation from the mailing\n  list management form, because it is impossible to extend it. When\n  https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/14386 gets merged (which upstreams most\n  needed changes), this addon will need a refactoring (mostly removing\n  duplicated functionality and depending on it instead of replacing it). In the\n  mean time, there is a little chance that this introduces some\n  incompatibilities with other addons that depend on ``website_mass_mailing``.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/social/issues>`_. In case of trouble, please\ncheck there if your issue has already been reported.
