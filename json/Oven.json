    "description": "What is oven\n============\n\nOven is basically a utility that allows you to compile coffeescript without\nhaving to have coffeescript or it's related modules on your local machine.  The\nclient-server architecture can actually be used for multiple things (more on\nthat later), but you can think of this as a software as a service type system\nthat you configure.\n\nWhat do I need\n==============\n\nFirst, a valid python installation that's version 2.6 or 2.7.  This application\nhas only been tested with 2.7, so 2.6 should work but don't quote me.  Some\nfeatures will not work with 3+.  Next, you will need to install coffeescript on\nwhatever computer you will be using as the server.  Finally, you'll need to\ninstall the server part on your serve (I recommend a vps, but anything you can\ncontact with a url or ip address will do fine) and then download the client.\nThat's about all there is to it.\n\nHow do I install this thing?\n============================\n\nYou can pretty much just go to whatever server your using and do pip install\noven.  That will install oven, and the dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.\n\nThen, to get the client, you can either scp the oven_client file from your\nserver to any client, or just run pip install oven on your client.  The\ninstallation lists the dependecies in the \"extras\" section, so they aren't\ninstalled automatically.  The client has no extra dependencies that don't come\nwith a regular python installation.  After that, you should have two commands,\noven and oven_server.  Oven will allow you to compile a file whereas oven_server\nwill start the server.\n\nFinally, it's optional to include a .ovenrc file.  This file is read from the\ndirectory that you start oven in and is handy if you want to have oven\nautomatically detect the server to use for compilation.  The structure of an\n.ovenrc file is as such:\n\n[servers]\nserver=http://url.com:port/\n\nUsing Oven\n==========\n\nOnce you've got all the dependencies installed, it's time to start using this\nthing.  The oven server is written in flask, so you may want to brush up on that\nfor configuration options.  Most options are stored in the config.py file\nhowever.  Using the oven client is also pretty simple.  There are a few command\nline options (more documentation to follow), but essentially you just type oven\nsource_file.coffee, and presto, you get a nice shiny source_file.js in the same\ndirectory.  Currently, the server dosen't support multiple people using it at\nthe same time, so don't try that yet.  This is a planned feature and will be\nimplemented SOON.\n\nUnder the Hood\n==============\n\nUnder the hood, oven is basically just taking a PUT request with some data,\ndoing something with it (in this case, saving it to a file and running the\ncoffeescript compiler on it) and then sending the data back.  The possibility to\nmodify this to handle basically ANY compiled language (as well as a laundry list\nof other services) is pretty high.  If you want to mod this to compile c\nprograms for example, that's incredibly easy.  This is under the MIT license, so\ngo nuts.",
