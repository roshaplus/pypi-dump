    "description": "====\nsnow\n====\n\nsnow is a simple script to deal with the cruft involved in managing WSGI\nprocesses with CherryPy's WSGI server. snow offers multiple ways to\nconfigure its usage giving complete control over the configuration.\n\nDependancies\n============\n\n * `PyYaml`_ 3.05\n\nThe versions numbers are not strict. They are simply the versions that were\nused during testing.\n\n.. _PyYaml: http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nInstall using pip::\n\n    pip install snow\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nConfiguration of snow is where its real power shines. You must create\nyourself ``~/.wsgirc`` file. The configuration format is YAML and has two\ntop-level keys, ``pid-path`` and ``processes``. Here is a quick sample::\n\n    pid-path: \"~/run\"\n\n    servers:\n        oebfare:\n            dispatcher: \"trac.web.main.dispatch_request\"\n\n        trac:\n            dispatcher: \"trac.web.main.dispatch_request\"\n\nGlobal Parameters\n-----------------\n\npid-path\n~~~~~~~~\n\nThe path where snow should store the PID files for the processes it\nspawns off.\n\nservers\n~~~~~~~\n\nA container for each process and their configuration.\n\nProcess Parameters\n------------------\n\ndispatcher\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis key is required. Its value is a Python module path to the WSGI callable\nused to dispatch the request.\n\nhost\n~~~~\n\nDefault: ``127.0.0.1``\n\nThe host on which the process should bind on.\n\nport\n~~~~\n\nDefault: ``None``\n\nThe port on which the process should listen to. ``port`` is optional at the\nconfiguration file level. However, is required to run the server. If not\nspecified in the configuration, it must be given to the command-line.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nWith the configuration all setup you are ready to manage WSGI processes. To\nstart the ``oebfare`` process execute::\n\n    snow oebfare start -p 9001\n\nParameters passed on the command-line will override any configuration of the\nsame kind.",
