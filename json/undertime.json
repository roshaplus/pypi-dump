    "description": "Undertime - pick a meeting time\n===============================\n\nUndertime is a rewrite of `overtime-cli`_ in Python because I felt we\nshouldn't need a Javascript virtual machine to pick a time. I was also\ncurious to see how such a rewrite would look like and was tired of\nloading a web browser every time I needed to figure out what time it\nwas elsewhere in the world or when I needed to coordinate\ninternational meetings.\n\n.. image:: undertime.png\n   :alt: undertime computing possible meeting time for multiple timezones\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTimezones should be passed on the commandline and are matched against\nthe `list of known timezones`_, as defined by the `pytz`_\npackage. Exact matches are attempted at first, but if that fails,\nsubstring matches are allowed, which makes it possible to do this::\n\n  undertime.py New_York Los_Angeles\n\nThe complete list of timezones is also shown when the\n``--print-zones`` commandline option is provided.\n\nColors are used to highlight the \"work hours\" where possible meeting\ntimes could overlap. You can change those work hours with the\n``--start`` and ``--end`` flags. Because daylight savings may actually\nchange time, you can also use the ``--date`` time to pick an arbitrary\ntime for the meeting, using natural language (as parsed by the\n`parsedatetime`_ library). The current time is also shown, in bold.\n\nFull usage is available with the ``--help`` flag.\n\n.. _list of known timezones: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones\n.. _pytz: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytz\n.. _parsedatetime: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/parsedatetime/\n.. _overtime-cli: https://github.com/diit/overtime-cli\n\nKnown issues and limitations\n============================\n\nThere are weird alignment issues when using colors, which seems to be\na bug with the upstream `terminaltables`_ library, filed as `issue\n#55`_.\n\nIt is possible that daylight saving times computations are\nincorrect. There are no unit tests for this program, which was only\nmanually tested with some commonly used timezones.\n\nTimezones are a delicate and complicated subject, and change\nconstantly. What may be applicable to your location at the current\ntime may not be reflected by your operating system or the chain of\nsoftware used by this program to determine time.\n\nIt should be possible for the program to show the user which are the\nbest times to possibly do a meeting. Those, for example, could be\noutlined in green or underlined to make it more obvious when the best\nmatches are.\n\n.. _terminaltables: https://robpol86.github.io/terminaltables/\n.. _issue #55: https://github.com/Robpol86/terminaltables/issues/55\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nThis program was written by Antoine Beaupr\u00e9 and is licensed under the\nAGPLv3+. It was inspired by the `overtime-cli`_ program and the\n`timeanddate.com`_ site.\n\n.. _timeanddate.com: https://www.timeanddate.com/\n\n\n",
