    "description": "**Currently only as placeholder (because a base package jtypes.jvm is still in development)**\n\njtypes.pyjava\n=============\n\nA Python to Java bridge\n\nOverview\n========\n\n  | jtypes.pyjava is a bridge allowing to use Java classes in regular Python code.\n  |\n  | jtypes.pyjava is a lightweight Python package, based on the *ctypes* or *cffi* library.\n  | It is an almost fully compliant implementation of Remi Rampin's *PyJava* package\n    by reimplementing whole its functionality in a clean Python instead of C/C++.\n\n\nAbout PyJava:\n-------------\n\nNote from the `original website <https://github.com/remram44/pyjava/blob/master/README.md>`__:\n\n    PyJava is a bridge allowing to use Java classes in regular Python code.\n    It is similar to `JPype <http://jpype.sourceforge.net/>`__.\n\n    It is a C extension that uses JNI to access a Java virtual machine,\n    meaning that it can be used anywhere Python is available. It is not\n    a different interpreter like `Jython <http://jython.org/>`__ and does\n    not require anything, other than a JRE. The JVM dynamic library is load\n    dynamically through pyjava.start() (some basic logic for locating this\n    library on major platforms will be provided).\n\n    The integration with Java code is meant to be as complete as possible,\n    allowing to use Java and Python objects seemlessly and converting objects\n    back and forth when Java code is called. Furthermore, subclassing Java\n    classes or interfaces in Python code to allow callback from Java is planned\n    for the 0.2 version.\n\n    Please note that this extension is still at a very early stage of\n    development and probably shouldn't be used for anything.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n- Either the Sun/Oracle JRE/JDK or OpenJDK.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n::\n\n    pip install --upgrade jtypes.pyjava\n\nTo ensure everything is running correctly you can run the tests using\n\n::\n\n    python -m jt.pyjava.tests\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n+ Python 2.7 or higher or 3.3 or higher\n\n  * http://www.python.org/\n  * Versions lower than 2.7 or lower than 3.3 WON'T WORK.\n  * 2.7 and 3.4 are primary test environments.\n\n+ pip or setuptools\n\n  * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip\n  * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n  | Copyright (c) 2015-2017 Adam Karpierz\n  |\n  | Licensed under the MIT License\n  | https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n  | Please refer to the LICENSE file.\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\n* Adam Karpierz <python@python.pl>\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n0.0.15a2 (2017-01-03)\n---------------------\n- First alpha release.\n\n0.0.10a1 (2016-09-24)\n---------------------\n- First alpha release.\n\n0.0.1 (2015-10-05)\n------------------\n- Initial version.\n",
