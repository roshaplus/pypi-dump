    "description": "Adhocracy\n=========\n\n\nAbout\n-----\n\nAdhocracy is a web based software tool which facilitates cooperative policy\ndrafting, proposal discussion and decisions in distributed groups.\n\nIt is primarily developed by the `Liquid Democracy e.V. <http://liqd.de>`_ as a\nplatform to implement Liquid Democracy concepts, as well as to provide a simple\nand working general purpose online participation platform.\n\n\nTechnology\n----------\n\nAdhocracy is mostly written in Python 2. It's built on top of many free\nsoftware projects, such as the Pylons web framework, the Solr search platform,\nMemcached, Redis, many Python libraries and more.\n\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nAdhocracy is known to run on current Linux systems, such as Debian Squeeze. It\nmight run on FreeBSD or OS X, but this hasn't been tested recently.\n\nInstallation is usually done through buildout or through an installer script\nfor Debian based systems. In either case, read `INSTALLATION.rst\n<INSTALLATION.rst>`_.\n\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nAdhocracy is openly developed as free software and distributed for the common\ngood under the `AGPLv3 license <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html>`_.\n\nSource code hosting, bug tracking and planned feature discussion is done `on\nGitHub <https://github.com/liqd/adhocracy>`_.\n\nCommunication also takes place on the `adhocracy-dev mailing list\n<http://lists.liqd.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/adhocracy-dev>`_.\n\nDocumentation is included in the source code and can be read online `on\nreadthedocs <http://adhocracy.readthedocs.org>`_.\n\nWe're very open for contributions, please drop us a note on the mailing list or\ncreate a pull request on GitHub.\n\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nCommunity support is available through the `adhocracy-dev mailing list\n<http://lists.liqd.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/adhocracy-dev>`_.\n\nCommercial support (installation, hosting, customization, training) is offered\nby the Liquid Democracy e.V. - you can reach us at `info(at)liqd(dot)de`.\n\nAdhocracy installation\n======================\n\nAdhocracy makes heavy use of\n`buildout <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout>`_, a Python build\ntool. It downloads, configures and builds nearly all dependencies to\ncreate a repeatable and isolated environment. In addition it sets up the\nsupervisord service manager, which allows to easily start and stop the\nservices which Adhocracy needs to run:\n\n-  adhocracy (http server that runs Adhocracy with Spawning/WSGI)\n-  adhocracy\\_worker (background queue processing)\n-  solr (searching)\n-  memcached (key-value cache)\n-  redis (internal messaging queue)\n\nAdhocracy is known to work on all modern Linux distributions, but should\nalso run on OS X and FreeBSD with minor modifications.\n\nThere are two supported ways of installing Adhocracy:\n\n-  A fully automatic installation, which downloads and sets up\n   everything, is available for Debian, Ubuntu and Arch Linux. This is\n   basically a wrapper around buildout.\n\n-  The manual installation, which directly uses the buildout commands.\n\nBoth are described in the following.\n\nIn any case you will need the following MIME types in ``/etc/mime.types``::\n\n    # webfonts\n    application/x-font-woff woff\n    application/font-truetype ttf\n\n    # socialshareprivacy 1.5 language files\n    application/json lang\n\nAutomatic installation on debian, Ubuntu or Arch Linux with build.sh\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn debian, Ubuntu, or Arch you can simply execute the following in a\nterminal:\n\n::\n\n    wget -nv https://raw.github.com/liqd/adhocracy/develop/build.sh -O build.sh && sh build.sh\n\nThe script will use sudo to install the required dependencies, and\ninstall, set up, and start the required services.\n\nAdd ``-c hhu`` to install with the preconfiguration for HHU D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\nManual installation\n-------------------\n\nPreparations\n````````````\n\nInstall required system packages (Debian Squeeze example):\n\n::\n\n    $ sudo apt-get install gcc make build-essential bin86 unzip libpcre3-dev mercurial git libssl-dev libbz2-dev pkg-config\n    $ sudo apt-get install python python-setuptools\n    $ sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev postgresql-server-dev-9.1\n    $ sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre\n    $ sudo apt-get install ruby rubygems ruby-dev\n\nTo make the apache vhost config work run:\n\n::\n\n    $ sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-proxy-html\n    $ sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http proxy_html\n\nCheck out Adhocracy:\n\n::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/liqd/adhocracy\n    $ cd adhocracy\n\n    $ git submodule init\n    $ git submodule update\n\nSetup an isolated python environment to run Adhocracy\n`````````````````````````````````````````````````````\nTo install Adhocracy you need python (2.6|2.7) with PIL (python imaging) but\nno other system-packages.\n\nCompile python and PIL with the included python buildout::\n\n    $ cd python\n    $ python bootstrap.py\n    $ bin/buildout\n    $ cd ..\n\nConfigure Adhocracy as desired\n``````````````````````````````\n\nCreate a custom buildout file and customize it as desired::\n\n    $ cp buildout buildout-my.cfg\n    $ vi buildout-my.cfg\n\nInstall and start Adhocracy\n```````````````````````````\n\nRun buildout:\n\n::\n\n    $ bin/python bootstrap.py\n    $ bin/buildout -c buildout-my.cfg\n\nStart Adhocracy and dependent servers:\n\n::\n\n    $ bin/supervisord\n\nIf you do not use the buildout to compile and start the database system\n(currently only possible for PostgreSQL, but disabled by default), you\nhave to setup the Adhocracy database manually:\n\n::\n\n    $ bin/paster setup-app etc/adhocracy.ini --name=content\n\nRun Adhocracy\n-------------\n\nStart Adhocracy and all dependent servers:\n\n::\n\n    $ bin/supervisord\n\nRestart servers:\n\n::\n\n    $ bin/supervisorctl reload\n\nView the status of all servers:\n\n::\n\n    $ bin/supervisorctl status\n\nTo start/stop one server:\n\n::\n\n    $ bin/supervisorctl stop <name>\n\nStart the Adhocracy server in foreground mode:\n\n::\n\n    $ bin/supervisorctl stop adhocracy\n    $ bin/paster serve etc/adhocracy.ini\n\nBuildout configuration\n----------------------\n\n-  Read ``buildout_commmon.cfg`` and ``buildout_development.cfg`` to\n   learn all buildout configuration options.\n-  Customize ``buildout.cfg`` to change the domains, ports and server\n   versions.\n-  Instead of compiling all dependencies (postgres, solr,..) you can\n   also use system packages.\n-  Use your custom buildout file to remove the included files you do not\n   need:\n\n::\n\n    [buildout] extends = buildout\\_development.cfg parts -= postgresql\n\nDeveloper instructions\n----------------------\n\nTo use your own `fork <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo>`_\ninstead of the regular(\"upstream\") adhocracy, use\n`git remote <http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-remote.html>`_:\n\n::\n\n    $ git remote -v\n    origin  https://github.com/liqd/adhocracy (fetch)\n    origin  https://github.com/liqd/adhocracy (push)\n    $ git remote add USERNAME https://github.com/USERNAME/adhocracy\n    $ git push USERNAME\n\nYou can now execute ``git pull origin`` to update your local copy with\nnew upstream changes. Use\n`commit <http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-commit.html>`_\nand\n`push <http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-push.html>`_\nto record and publish your changes. As soon as you are confident that\nyou have implemented a feature or corrected a bug, create a `pull\nrequest <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_ to ask\nthe core developers to incorporate your changes.\n\nAdhocracy Changelog\n===================\n\n\n2.5.3 (2015-03-08)\n------------------\n\nImprovements:\n\n- Hide google openid (deprecated by Google)\n\n- Upgrade various dependencies\n\n- Allow to not list global members in instance.members (#945)\n\n- Autoactivate Shibboleth users (#944)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- Fix amendment w/o selection (#952)\n\n- Fix came_from encoding after register (#948)\n\n- Fix creation of static pages with database backend\n\n\n2.5.2 (2014-10-13)\n------------------\n\nImprovements:\n\n- Allow to define post_logout_url.\n\n- Allow to hide category navigation item.\n\n- Allow to restrict locale choice.\n\n- Sort milestones by date, secondarily by title.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- Fix badge form in overlay after validation error.

When upgrading from 2.0.0\nto 2.1.x, simply jump to 2.1.1 directly by doing `git checkout 2.1.1`.\n\nChanges:\n\n- Make sure the `src/adhocracy/alembic/versions` directory actually exists in\n  order to make `bin/paster setup-app ...` work.\n\n- Update some dependencies.\n\n- Fix search box placeholder for instances with quotes in title. (#740)\n\n\n2.1.0 (2014-02-04)\n------------------\n\nThis upgrade only splits the SQLAlchemy-related changes from the 2.0.0 release\nin order to make sure all migrations are executed and the database remains in\na consistent state.\n\nChanges:\n\n- Update SQLAlchemy from 0.7.10 to 0.9.1.\n\n- Switch from sqlalchemy-migrate to Alembic. (#219)\n\n\nUpgrade instructions:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you haven't upgraded for a long time (say six months or more), it's best to\ndelete ``parts``, ``eggs``, ``python/python-2.7`` and ``python/parts``\ndirectories and rebuild everything according to ``INSTALLATION.rst``.\n\nIn any case, don't upgrade to 2.1.0 in one go, but upgrade to 2.0.0 first by\nrunning::\n\n    git checkout 2.0.0\n    bin/buildout\n    bin/paster setup-app etc/adhocracy.ini --name=content\n\nAnd upgrade to 2.1.0 in a second step::\n\n    git checkout 2.1.0\n    bin/buildout\n    bin/paster setup-app etc/adhocracy.ini --name=content\n\nThis makes sure the remaining sqlalchemy-migration based migrations are\nexecuted in the first step, and the Alembic environment is initialized properly\nin the second step.\n\n\n2.0.0 (2014-02-03)\n------------------\n\n- Start doing releases using semantic versioning (#77). This release's\n  changelog contains many changes from the past two years, but rather\n  incomplete.\n\n- Allow to list norms in a tiled fashion. (#714)\n\n- Add container pages. These special norms act as containers of other norms.\n  (#709)\n\n- Proposal descriptions can now be shown directly in proposal lists. (#733)\n\n- It is now possible to translate the English source strings through Transifex\n  as it is done in all other languages. In Transifex, the `en_GB` language\n  is used as the \"translated\" English langauage in contrast to the \"source\"\n  English langauage and doesn't imply that british English shall be used.\n  (#102)\n\n- Automatically crop and center uploaded images (logos etc) to the desired\n  size. (#711)\n\n- Badges can now be managed in context. (#713)\n\n- Add images and long description texts to categories. Categories can now be\n  listed and individually displayed, each showing all assigned proposals.\n  (#695)\n\n- Added user import script. (#649)\n\n- We redesigned the instance settings. The most notable change is the added\n  possibility to select presets on instance creation. (#680)\n\n  The user import and massmessage services have been moved.  They can be found\n  on the members index and instance overview, respectively.\n\n- It is now possible to follow instances. (#655)\n\n- All milestones now must have a date. (#658)\n\n- Added installation option to freeze the complete installation. (#289)\n\n- It is possible to select whether other users can edit a proposal.\n  We added an instance option to set the default value of that option. (#632)\n\n- a11y improvements.\n\n- Added replay notification script, which recreates notifications inside the\n  database which would have been created before notifications were stored in\n  the database. (#624)\n\n- We completely redesigned the user profile (#430) and dashboard (#429): User\n  can upload an avatar now (#641) and view notifications online.\n\n- Email texts are now wrapped at 78 characters per line. Long links are\n  preserved. (#593)\n\n- Added travis configuration which automatically builds Adhocracy using\n  build.sh and runs the test suite.\n\n- It is now possible to assign user badges in user import.\n  It is also possible to define additional variables which can be used in\n  the welcome email.\n\n- Added an installation option to redirect to an instance instead of showing\n  the front page. This is useful for single-instance installations. (#431)\n\n- New comment design.\n\n- Subnorms can now be displayed as sections. This way you can add a large\n  document consisting of multiple sections and have each of these sections\n  discussed separately.\n\n- It is now possible to show all open proposals in the proposal list of future\n  milestones. For milestones in the past, this doesn't have any effect. (#562)\n\n  This will be used in the following scenario:\n\n  - There's regular (offline) board meetings. These are entered as milestones.\n    During a meeting, the board shall work on as many of the highest rated,\n    non-frozen proposals as time permits.\n  - All covered proposals will be assigned to the respective milestone, marked\n    as frozen and badged as \"implemented\" (or whatever).\n  - All not covered proposals will be covered in successive meetings.\n\n- It is now possible to freeze single proposals. (#559)\n\n- Overlays have their own urls now, so you can link to them. (#553)\n\n- Add warning to users of unsupported browsers. (#111)\n\n- Better user settings layout. (#174)\n\n- Allow footer customization through static URLs. (#472)\n\n- Add custom \"show more\" markdown extension. (#120)\n\n- build.sh now has Fedora support\n\n- Refactor all CSS and some of the templates to make development and\n  theming easier. We also switched to SCSS.\n\n- Added varnish reverse proxy [joka]\n\n- Readd bin/test to run tests (wrapper for py.test) [joka]\n\n- Update python from 2.7.4 to 2.7.5. Please rebuild python:\n\n    * cd python\n    * bin/buildout\n\n  [joka]\n\n- Use pytest testrunner instead of nose. (#343)\n\n- Add shibboleth based authentication. (#359)\n\n- Allow to disable tutorials installation-wide. (#54)\n\n- Update buildout from 1.7 to 2.1.0 (#241). Rerun buildout with::\n\n      bin/buildout -n\n\n  If you have versions conflicts with distribute delete the old one::\n\n      rm -r eggs/distribute..\".\n\n  [joka]\n\n- The default way to isolate your python environment is now to compile\n  python and PIL now instead of using virtualenv::\n\n    Upgrade manual installation:\n    ----------------------------\n\n    Checkout python buildout\n\n    * git submodule init\n    * git submodule update\n\n    Compile python:\n\n    * cd python\n    * python boostrap.py && bin/buildout\n\n    Reinstall Adhocracy:\n\n    * cd ../\n    * rm -rf eggs/*\n    * bin/python bootstrap.py\n    * bin/buildout\n\n    Upgrade build.sh:\n    -----------------\n\n    * rm -rf eggs/*\n    * sh build.sh -u\n    * sh build.sh -s\n\n    [joka]\n\n- Add controversy sorting method to proposals. (#258)\n\n- Allow to hide voting lists from the UI. (#189)\n\n- Badges with thumbnails. (#191)\n\n- Option to disable registration. (#43)\n\n- Login via email address\n\n- Hierarchical categories. (#95)\n\n- Formatted norms. (#192)\n\n- Replace RabbitMQ/amqp with redis/rq (#220). This means that you have to\n  provide a working redis instance if you want to use asyncronous\n  jobs (highly recommended in production).\n  The background process that processes the jobs is renamed from\n  'background' to 'worker'. You can call it with\n  `bin/paster --plugin=adhocracy worker -c etc/adhocracy.ini`\n\n  Configuration changes:\n\n  * dropped: adhocracy.amqp.* settings are not required anymore.\n  * new: adhocracy.redis.host: An IP address redis can bind to\n    (not a hostname!)\n  * new: adhocracy.redis.port: The port redis will open\n  * new: adhocracy.redis.queue: The queue name\n\n- Mandatory email validation. (#142)\n\n- Invisible badges. (#116)\n\n- Instance-based user rating sorting. (#190)\n\n- Disallow multiple usernames with only case differences. (#171)\n\n- Dashboard style instance overview page. (#90)\n\n- Support path based instances instead of subdomain only. (#62)\n\n- Feedback instance pull in form. (#88)\n\n- Lamson mailserver dummy for development purposes.\n\n- Added facet search to the instance listing. The listing is based on solr now,\n  please reindex. [joka]\n\n- Instances can have badges now. To create instance badges use the\n  site-administration -> badges form. To assign badges use the\n  instance listing. [joka]\n\n- New config option \"adhocracy.registration.email.blacklist\" that\n  accepts a whitespace seperated list of email address and\n  blocks registrations with those. Dots will be stripped before\n  the test (to catch gmail addresses where dots are ignored by gmail).\n  [csenger]\n\n- New config option \"adhocracy.listings.instance.sorting\" that makes\n  the sort options for the instance listing configurable. This\n  possible values are: OLDEST, NEWEST, ACTIVITY and ALPHA. [csenger]\n\n- Permission change: When we test the 'norm.create' permission\n  (permission to create Norms/Topics/Themen we do no longer\n  restrict it to users who also have 'instance.admin'. The main\n  permission we check now is 'page.create'.\n\n  Please check the permission 'page.create' in your permission\n  settings (<base_url>/admin -> Permissions). [csenger]\n\n- Give the users the option to permanently activate the twitter,\n  facebook or google+ buttons. Save the setting in a wildcard\n  subdomain cookie so it is valid across all instances.\n\n  This requires a updated js.socialshareprivacy to work with\n  our auth cookie. [csenger]\n\n- Add the possibility to overwrite templates in <adhocracy.site>/templates\n  directory (like it's possible for static resources and static pages already.\n  New templates there need a server restart to be picked up.\n  [csenger]\n\n- Deliver (almost) all resources with fanstatic. [csenger]\n\n- Delegateables can have category badges. [joka]\n\n- Instances can have badges, they are only valid inside that instance. [joka]\n\n- Added option to set the smtp port. [joka]\n\n- Many bugfixes.\n\n- Many other unmentioned improvements.\n\n\n1.2a4\n-----\n\n- Tooltips use jquery tools now. [joka]\n- Open helper link, login and register form with overlay. [joka]\n- Recaptcha support (disabled by default). [joka]\n- Proposals can have badgets #263. [joka]\n\n\n1.2a1\n-----\n\n- Users can have badgets #214. [carsten]\n- Proposal listing with natural sort #212. [joka]\n\n\n1.1 (2010-12-05)\n----------------\n\n- Join \"Goal\" and \"Implementation\" pages on proposals.\n- Migrate from whoosh to solr.\n- Allow single-instance mode of operation.\n- Allow per-instance deactivation of norms.\n- Remove wiki from system.\n- Change from cron-initiated regular background processing.\n  to continuous background queue polling process.\n- Add INSTALL.txt and CHANGES.txt.\n- Change from BSD license to AGPL-3.\n- Update to SQLAlchemy 0.6.\n- Many smaller bug fixes.\n\n\n1.0 (2010-07-24)\n----------------\n\n- Initial stable release.\n\nAdhocracy is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3,\nwhich can be found in LICENSE.txt\n\nAdhocracy is Copyright 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 by\n\nFriedrich Lindenberg\nJoscha Krutzki\nCarsten Senger\nNicolas Dietrich\nPhilipp Hagemeister\nTobias Bengfort\n\nand others.
