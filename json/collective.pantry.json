These HTML snippets can be added using two approaches. You can define\ntheme defined snippets, idealy defined by the themer or designer. In addition,\nyou can also enable the users to be able to define their own HTML snippets\nusing the content type provided.\n\nThe snippets are available from the template button on TinyMCE, ready to be\nused.\n\nIt also enables the \"Pantry\". It's a summary view of Plone style elements along\nwith the theme and user snippets. It's an update of the good old\n`test_rendering` view.\n\nTheme Snippets\n--------------\n\nThey are defined as HTML files in a directory called `pantry`. The format is\nplain HTML. At a later point, you can also override them or add more theme\nsnippets if you customize the theme using the Plone Theme editor.\n\nUser Snippets\n-------------\n\nThis product makes available a content type called `snippet`. Each snippet is a\npage-like object that defines a single snippet. They are meant to be\nuser-defined. As any other content type, you can give the users permissions\nover them, or disable them completely, depending on your use case.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall collective.pantry by adding it to your buildout::\n\n    [buildout]\n\n    ...\n\n    eggs =\n        collective.pantry\n\n\nand then running ``bin/buildout``\n\n\nContribute\n----------\n\n- Issue Tracker: https://github.com/collective/collective.pantry/issues\n- Source Code: https://github.com/collective/collective.pantry\n- Documentation: https://docs.plone.org/foo/bar\n\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nIf you are having issues, please let us know.\nWe have a mailing list located at: project@example.com\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThe project is licensed under the GPLv2.\n\n\nContributors\n============\n\n- Victor Fernandez de Alba, sneridagh@gmail.com\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n\n1.0a1 (unreleased)\n------------------\n\n- Initial release.\n  [sneridagh]",
