No need to twiddle with AWS.\n\n## Looking for contributors\n\n[click here for more info](https://github.com/Alephbet/gimel/issues/2)\n\n## What does Gimel mean?\n\nGimel (\u05d2\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05de\u05b5\u05dc) is the 3rd letter of the Hebrew Alphabet. The letter (\u05d2) also looks visually similar to the greek Lambda\n(\u03bb).\n\n## Installation / Quick Start\n\nYou will need a live instance of redis accessible online from AWS. Then run:\n\n```bash\n$ pip install gimel\n$ gimel configure\n$ gimel deploy\n```\n\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/gingerlime-images/gimel-deploy.gif \"gimel deploy\")\n\nIt will automatically configure your AWS Lambda functions, API gateway and produce a JS snippet ready to use\nfor tracking your experiments.\n\n## Architecture\n\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/gingerlime-images/gimel-architecture.png \"Architecture\")\n\n### Client\n\nI suggest looking at [Alephbet](https://github.com/Alephbet/alephbet) to get more details, but at a high level, the client runs on the end-user browser. It will randomly pick a variant and execute a javascript function to 'activate' it. When a goal is reached -- user performs a certain action, this also include the pseudo-goal of *participating* in the experiment -- then an event is sent to the backend. An event typically looks something like \"experiment ABC, variant red, user participated\", or \"experiment XYZ, variant blue, check out goal reached\".\n\nAlephbet might send duplicate events, but each event should include a `uuid` to allow the backend to de-duplicate it. More below\n\n### Data Store - Redis HyperLogLog\n\nThe data store keeps a tally of each event that comes into the system. Being able to count unique events (de-duplication) was important to keep an accurate count. One approach would be to store each event in an entry / database row / document, and then run some kind of a unique count on it. Or we could use a nifty algorithm called [HyperLogLog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog). HyperLogLog allows you to count unique counts without storing each and every item.\n\nIn terms of storage space, redis HyperLogLog offers a fixed size of 12k per counter. This gives us ample space for storing experiment data with low memory footprint.\n\n### Backend - AWS Lambda / API Gateway\n\nThe backend had to take care of a few simple types of requests:\n\n* track an event - receive a (HTTP) request with some json data -- experiment name, variant, goal and uuid, and then push it to redis.\n* extract the counters for a specific experiment, or all experiments into some json that can be presented on the dashboard.\n\n### Dashboard\n\nNew! access your dashboard with `gimel dashboard`\n\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/gingerlime-images/gimel-dashboard.gif \"gimel dashboard\")\n\n## How does tracking work?\n\nCheck out [Alephbet](https://github.com/Alephbet/alephbet).\n\n## Command Reference\n\n* `gimel --help` - prints a help screen.\n* `gimel configure` - opens your editor so you can edit the config.json file. Use it to update your redis settings.\n* `gimel preflight` - runs preflight checks to make sure you have access to AWS, redis etc.\n* `gimel deploy` - deploys the code and configs to AWS automatically.\n\n## License\n\nGimel is distributed under the MIT license.
