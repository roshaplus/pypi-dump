    "description": "|Build Status| |Documentation Status|\n\nwireless\n========\n\nA dead simple, cross-platform Python library to connect to wireless\nnetworks.\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nThis library can control a computer's wireless adapter to connect to a\nnetwork. Environments currently supported include (in order of\npreference):\n\n+-------------------+-----------------------+---------------------------------------+\n| Network Manager   | Operating Systems     | Tested Adapters                       |\n+===================+=======================+=======================================+\n| nmcli             | Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04   | Linksys AE3000, Intel Centrino 6250   |\n+-------------------+-----------------------+---------------------------------------+\n| wpa\\_supplicant   | Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04   | Intel Centrino 6250                   |\n+-------------------+-----------------------+---------------------------------------+\n| networksetup      | Mac OS 10.10          | Macbook Pro                           |\n+-------------------+-----------------------+---------------------------------------+\n\nSetup\n-----\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    sudo pip install wireless\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nA typical usage looks like this:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from wireless import Wireless\n    wireless = Wireless()\n    wireless.connect(ssid='ssid', password='password')\n\nNote: To use ``nmcli`` on Ubuntu 14.04, the right permissions must be in\nplace. A few options are listed\n`here <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager#Set_up_PolicyKit_permissions>`__.\n\nNote: To use ``wpa_supplicant``, ``network-manager`` (the backend for\n``nmcli``) must not be running. This is because ``network-manager`` runs\nan instance of ``wpa_supplicant`` behind the scenes which will conflict\nwith the ``wpa_supplicant`` instance that this library would create. If\nyou have a ``network-manager`` on your machine but would prefer to use\n``wpa_supplicant`` (not recommended), run\n``sudo service network-manager stop`` before using ``wireless``.\n\nAPI\n---\n\n-  ``Wireless([interface])`` - initialize the wireless driver\n-  ``connect(ssid, password)`` - attempts to connect to a network and\n   returns True on success\n-  ``current()`` - returns the name of the current network or None\n   otherwise\n-  ``interfaces()`` - list the available interfaces\n-  ``interface([interface])`` - get or set the current interface\n-  ``power([True||False])`` - get or set the power status of the adapter\n-  ``driver()`` - return the name of driver being used for wireless\n   control\n\nChange History\n--------------\n\nThis project uses `semantic versioning <http://semver.org/>`__.\n\nv0.3.2 - 2016/03/06\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  Added a few tests and fixed a py34 bug\n   (`XayOn <https://github.com/XayOn>`__)\n\nv0.3.1 - 2015/04/24\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  Added version check for nmcli\n   (`Silarn <https://github.com/Silarn>`__)\n\nv0.3.0 - 2015/01/13\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  Added support for ``wpa_supplicant``\n-  Added the ``driver()`` method\n\nv0.2.1 - 2014/12/01\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  remove dependency on ``pandoc``\n\nv0.2.0 - 2014/11/25\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  Added support for multiple network adapters with ``interface()`` and\n   ``interfaces()`` methods\n-  The ``current()`` method actually asks the wireless driver for the\n   current SSID instead of returning the name of the most recently\n   connected network\n-  Added the ``power()`` method\n\nv0.1.1 - 2014/11/24\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  Better documentation formatting for PyPI\n\nv0.1.0 - 2014/11/22\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  Initial release\n\nContributions\n-------------\n\nPull requests to the ``develop`` branch are welcomed!\n\nPublishing\n----------\n\nFirst, install ``pandoc`` so that setup.py can auto-convert Markdown\nsyntax into reStructuredText:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    sudo apt-get install pandoc\n    sudo pip install pypandoc\n\nThen, following `this\nguide <http://peterdowns.com/posts/first-time-with-pypi.html>`__, push\nthe project to PyPI:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    sudo python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/joshvillbrandt/wireless.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/joshvillbrandt/wireless\n.. |Documentation Status| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/wireless/badge/?version=latest\n   :target: http://wireless.readthedocs.org/en/latest/",
