    "description": "====================\n`cti-taxii-client`\n====================\n\nNOTE: This is an `OASIS Open Repository\n<https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/>`_. See the\n`Governance`_ section for more information.\n\ncti-taxii-client is a minimal implementation of client for the TAXII 2.0 server.\nIt supports the following TAXII 2.0 API services:\n\n- Server Discovery\n- Get API Root Information\n- Get Status\n- Get Collections\n- Get a Collection\n- Get Objects\n- Add Objects\n- Get an Object\n- Get Object Manifests\n\n`Installation`\n==============\n\nThe easiest way to install the TAXII client is with pip::\n\n  $ pip install taxii2-client\n\n\n`Usage`\n=======\n\nThe TAXII client is intended to be used as a Python library.  There are no\ncommand line clients at this time.\n\n``taxii2-client`` provides four classes:\n\n- ``Server``\n- ``ApiRoot``\n- ``Collection``\n- ``Status``\n\nEach can be instantiated by passing a `url`, and (optional) `user` and\n`password` arguments.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  from taxii2client import Collection\n  collection = Collection('https://example.com/api1/collections/91a7b528-80eb-42ed-a74d-c6fbd5a26116')\n  collection.get_object('indicator--252c7c11-daf2-42bd-843b-be65edca9f61')\n\nYou can also traverse parent-to-child relationships directly:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  from taxii2client import Server\n  server = Server('https://example.com/taxii/', 'user_id', 'user_password')\n  api_root = server.api_roots[0]\n  collection = api_root.collections[0]\n  collection.add_objects(stix_bundle)\n\nIn addition to the object-specific properties and methods, all classes have a\n``refresh()`` method that reloads the URL corresponding to that resource, to\nensure properties have the most up-to-date values.\n\n\nGovernance\n==========\n\nThis GitHub public repository (\n**https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-taxii-client** ) was created at the request\nof the `OASIS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) TC\n<https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cti/>`__ as an `OASIS Open Repository\n<https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/>`__ to support\ndevelopment of open source resources related to Technical Committee work.\n\nWhile this Open Repository remains associated with the sponsor TC, its\ndevelopment priorities, leadership, intellectual property terms, participation\nrules, and other matters of governance are `separate and distinct\n<https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-taxii-client/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#governance-distinct-from-oasis-tc-process>`__\nfrom the OASIS TC Process and related policies.\n\nAll contributions made to this Open Repository are subject to open source\nlicense terms expressed in the `BSD-3-Clause License\n<https://www.oasis-open.org/sites/www.oasis-open.org/files/BSD-3-Clause.txt>`__.\nThat license was selected as the declared `\"Applicable License\"\n<https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses>`__ when the\nOpen Repository was created.\n\nAs documented in `\"Public Participation Invited\n<https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-taxii-client/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#public-participation-invited>`__\",\ncontributions to this OASIS Open Repository are invited from all parties,\nwhether affiliated with OASIS or not.
