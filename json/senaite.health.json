With this approach, you'll be able to download the\nlatest source code from `senaite.health's repository <https://github.com/senaite/senaite.health>`_\nand contribute as well.\n\nUse git to fetch ``senaite.health`` source code to your buildout environment::\n\n  cd src\n  git clone git://github.com/senaite/senaite.health.git senaite.health\n\nCreate a new buildout file ``senaite.cfg`` which extends your existing\n``buildout.cfg`` \u2013 this way you can easily keep development stuff separate\nfrom your main buildout.cfg which you can also use on the production server.\n\n``senaite.cfg``::\n\n  [buildout]\n  index = https://pypi.python.org/simple\n  extends = buildout.cfg\n  develop +=\n      src/senaite.health\n\n  [instance]\n  eggs +=\n      senaite.health\n\nNote that with this approach you do not need to modify the existing buildout.cfg\nfile.\n\nThen build it out with this special config file::\n\n  bin/buildout -c senaite.cfg\n\nand buildout will automatically download and install all required dependencies.\n\n\nContribute\n==========\n\nWe want contributing to SENAITE.HEALTH to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for\nanyone, and everyone.
