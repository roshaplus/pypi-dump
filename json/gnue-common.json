    "description": "GNUe-Common is the basis for the GNUe tools, such as Forms,\r\nReports, Application Server, and Designer.  It implements a\r\ndatabase-abstraction layer that provides support for most major\r\ndatabases. A builtin XML-to-Object parser and Object-to-XML\r\nmarshaller are used by Forms, Reports, and Designer to save\r\nand read Forms/Report definitions to and from an XML file.\r\nIt also defines and implements an RPC abstraction layer that\r\nwill allow server processes to define their public methods once\r\nand have them available to CORBA, XML-RPC, SOAP, and DCOM\r\nclients.",
