    "description": "aws-google-auth\n===============\n\nThis command-line tool allows you to acquire AWS temporary (STS)\ncredentials using Google Apps as a federated (Single Sign-On, or SSO)\nprovider.\n\nSetup\n-----\n\nYou'll first have to set up Google Apps as a SAML identity provider\n(IdP) for AWS. There are tasks to be performed on both the Google Apps\nand the Amazon sides; these references should help you with those\nconfigurations:\n\n-  `How to Set Up Federated Single Sign-On to AWS Using Google\n   Apps <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-set-up-federated-single-sign-on-to-aws-using-google-apps/>`__\n-  `Using Google Apps SAML SSO to do one-click login to\n   AWS <https://blog.faisalmisle.com/2015/11/using-google-apps-saml-sso-to-do-one-click-login-to-aws/>`__\n\nIf you need a fairly simple way to assign users to roles in AWS\naccounts, we have another tool called `Google AWS\nFederator <https://github.com/cevoaustralia/google-aws-federator>`__\nthat might help you.\n\nImportant Data\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou will need to know Google's assigned Identity Provider ID, and the ID\nthat they assign to the SAML service provider.\n\nOnce you've set up the SAML SSO relationship between Google and AWS, you\ncan find the SP ID by drilling into the Google Apps console, under\n``Apps > SAML Apps > Settings for AWS SSO`` -- the URL will include a\ncomponent that looks like ``...#AppDetails:service=123456789012...`` --\nthat number is ``GOOGLE_SP_ID``\n\nYou can find the ``GOOGLE_IDP_ID``, again from the admin console, via\n``Security > Set up single sign-on (SSO)`` -- the ``SSO URL`` includes a\nstring like ``https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/idp?idpid=aBcD01AbC``\nwhere the last bit (after the ``=``) is the IDP ID.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can install quite easily via ``pip``, if you want to have it on your\nlocal system:\n\n.. code:: shell\n\n    localhost$ sudo pip install aws-google-auth\n\nIf you don't want to have the tool installed on your local system, or if\nyou prefer to isolate changes, there is a Dockerfile provided, which you\ncan build with:\n\n.. code:: shell\n\n    localhost$ cd ..../aws-google-auth && docker build -t aws-google-auth .\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n1. Set environment variables for ``GOOGLE_USERNAME``, ``GOOGLE_IDP_ID``,\n   and ``GOOGLE_SP_ID`` (see above under \"Important Data\" for how to\n   find the last two; the first one is usually your email address)\n2. For Docker:\n   ``docker run -it -e GOOGLE_USERNAME -e GOOGLE_IDP_ID -e GOOGLE_SP_ID aws-google-auth``\n3. For Python: ``aws-google-auth``\n\nYou'll be prompted for your password. If you've set up an MFA token for\nyour Google account, you'll also be prompted for the current token\nvalue.\n\nIf you have more than one role available to you, you'll be prompted to\nchoose the role from a list; otherwise, if your credentials are correct,\nyou'll just see the AWS keys printed on stdout.\n\nYou should ``eval`` the ``export`` statements that come out, because\nthat'll set environment variables for you. This tools currently doesn't\nwrite credentials to an ``~/.aws/credentials`` file\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\nThis work is inspired by `keyme <https://github.com/wheniwork/keyme>`__\n-- their digging into the guts of how Google SAML auth works is what's\nenabled it.",
