Freeze and quantize your graph\n    - [Freezing](https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/tool_developers/#freezing)\n    - [Quantization](https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/quantization)\n        - An alternative is to use the [`quantize_graph.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/quantization/quantize_graph.py) script\n        - it should output one qunatized pb file, say `quantized_graph.pb`\n2. install `utensor_cgent`\n    - run `python3 setupt.py install`\n3. run `utensor-cli quantized_graph.pb`, where `quantized_graph.pb` is the output pb file you get from step **1**\n    - run `utensor-cli -h` for help\n\n# TODOs\n1. (done) Freezed graph protobuff parser\n2. (done)Tensor snippets for [`uTensor`](https://github.com/neil-tan/uTensor)\n3. (done) Add template engine for richer flexibility\n    - [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org)\n4. (done?) core code generator implementation\n    - We need some refatoring, PRs are welcomed!\n5. type alias in C/C++\n    - ex: use `uint8_t` or `unsigned char`?\n    - a lot more about this.... \n6. (done) `MANIFAST.in` for the `setup.py`\n7. Relation among snippets/containers\n    - shared template variables? (headers, shared placeholders...etc)\n8. Better configuration schema\n    - json\n    - yaml\n    - or ?\n",
