    "description": "django-jom is a Django/Javascript implementation of the SSMVC pattern. Interactive, rich and mobile web applications are based on the MVC pattern in which models contains the data on which the application is built. However mobile and Javascript clients are forced to replicate the MVC pattern in order to operate. The SSMVC pattern avoid code duplication by automatically extracting and synchronizing the front-end models with back-end.",
