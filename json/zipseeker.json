    "description": "Zip file streamer for HTTP\n==========================\n\nSimilar systems/projects:\n\n* The `Nginx zip module\n  <https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/modules/zip/>`_. Only for Nginx, so\n  can't be used with other webservers.\n* `python-zipstream <https://github.com/allanlei/python-zipstream>`_. Does not\n  support calculating the file size beforehand or seeing through the file.\n\nUsage:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import zipseeker\n    \n    # Create an index\n    fp = zipseeker.ZipSeeker()\n    fp.add('some/file.txt')\n    fp.add('another/file.txt', 'file2.txt')\n    \n    # Calculate the total file size, e.g. for the Content-Length HTTP header.\n    contentLength = fp.size()\n    \n    # Calculate the last-modified date, e.g. for the Last-Modified HTTP header.\n    lastModified = fp.lastModified()\n    \n    # Send the ZIP file to the client\n    # Optionally add the start and end parameters for range requests.\n    # Note that the ZIP format doesn't support actually skipping parts of the file,\n    # as it needs to calculate the CRC-32 of every file at the end of the file.\n    fp.writeStream(outputFile)\n\nWhy?\n----\n\nWhile the file size of a ZIP file usually can't be calculated beforehand due to\ncompression, this is actually optional. The headers itself also have a pretty\nconstant size. That means that the whole file can have a predetermined file size\n(and modtime).\n\nThis is useful when you want to provide ZIP downloads of large directories with\nuncompressable files (e.g. images). The specific use case I created this media\nfile for was to provide downloads of whole photo albums without such\ninconveniences as requesting a downloading link in an e-mail, using a lot system\nresources for the creation of temporary files, and having to delete these files\nafterwards.\n\nOf course, it's possible to just stream a ZIP file, but that won't provide any\nprogress indication for file downloads and certainly doesn't support `Range\nrequests <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests>`_.\n\nFor more information, see the `Nginx zip module\n<https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/modules/zip/>`_.\n\nTODO\n----\n\n* Implement actual seeking in the file - this should be doable.\n* Use a CRC-32 cache that can be shared by the calling module.\n\n",
