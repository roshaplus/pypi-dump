    "description": "Python Crop Simulation Environment - PCSE\n=========================================\n\nPCSE is a framework developed for implementing crop simulation models developed in\nWageningen. Many of the Wageningen crop simulation models were originally developed\nin FORTRAN77 or using the FORTRAN Simulation Translator (`FST`_). Although this\napproach has yielded high quality models with high numerical performance, the\ninherent limitations of models written in FORTRAN is also becoming increasingly evident:\n\n* The structure of the models is often rather monolithic and the different parts are\n  very tightly coupled. Replacing parts of the model with another simulation approach\n  is not easy.\n* The models rely on file-based I/O which is difficult to change. For example,\n  interfacing with databases is complicated in FORTRAN.\n* In general, with low-level languages like FORTRAN, simple things already take many\n  lines of code and mistakes are easily made, particularly by agronomists and crop\n  scientist that have limited experience in developing or adapting software.\n\nTo overcome many of the limitations above, the Python Crop Simulation Environment\n(PCSE) was developed which provides an environment for developing simulation models\nas well as a number of implementations of crop simulation models. PCSE is written\nin pure python code which makes it more flexible, easier to modify and extensible\nallowing easy interfacing with databases, graphical user interfaces, visualization\ntools and numerical/statistical packages. PCSE has several interesting features:\n\n* Implementation in pure python and the core system has a small number of dependencies outside the python standard\n  library. Most of these can be automatically installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI) (`SQLAlchemy`, `PyYAML`,\n  `tabulate`, `xlwt`, `xlrd`) although some additional modules rely on `NumPy`.\n\n* Modular design allowing you to add or change components relatively quickly with\n  a simple but powerful approach to communicate variables between modules.\n\n* Similar to `FST`_, it enforces good model design by explicitly separating parameters,\n  rate variables and state variables. Moreover PCSE takes care of the module\n  initialization, calculation of rates of changes, updating of state variables\n  and actions needed to finalize the simulation.\n\n* Input/Output is completely separated from the simulation model itself. Therefore\n  PCSE models can easily read from and write to text files, databases and scientific\n  formats such as HDF or NetCDF.\n\n* Tools are available for reading parameter and weather files from existing models to\n  have as much backward compatibility as possible.\n\n* An `AgroManager` module which allows to define the agromanagement actions that\n  happen on a farmers field. Such actions can be specified as events based on\n  time or model state.\n\n* Built-in testing of program modules ensuring integrity of the system.\n\nTo contribute to PCSE, you can fork your own copy at https://github.com/ajwdewit/pcse\n\nFull documentation is available on http://pcse.readthedocs.io\n\n.. _FST: http://models.pps.wur.nl/sites/models.pps.wur.nl/files/FST%203.pdf",
