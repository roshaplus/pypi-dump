    "description": "PyMuPDF 1.11.0\r\n==================\r\n\r\nRelease date: May 1, 2017\r\n\r\nAuthors\r\n=======\r\n\r\n* Ruikai Liu\r\n* Jorj X. McKie\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n============\r\n\r\nThis is **version 1.11.0 of PyMuPDF (formerly python-fitz)**, a Python binding which supports `MuPDF 1.11 <http://mupdf.com/>`_ - \"a lightweight PDF and XPS viewer\".\r\n\r\nMuPDF can access files in PDF, XPS, OpenXPS and EPUB (e-book) formats, and it is known for its top performance and high rendering quality.\r\n\r\nWith PyMuPDF you therefore can also access files with extensions ``*.pdf``, ``*.xps``, ``*.oxps`` or ``*.epub`` from your Python scripts.\r\n\r\nSee the `Wiki <https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF/wiki>`_ for more info/news/release notes/etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nYou need to have MuPDF generated first. This process depends on your platform, see below. MuPDF's source comes with installation procedures for various operating systems, so you should be able to pick the right one for you. Linux versions also often provide pre-generated MuPDF software.\r\n\r\nFor Non-Windows systems, probably the safest way is to generate MuPDF from source. Download the official release from https://mupdf.com/downloads/. MuPDF's GitHub repository contains the latest **development source** - this is **not** what you want in this context. Make sure PyMuPDF already supports this MuPDF version, otherwise skip to an earlier release: https://mupdf.com/downloads/archive/.\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, adjust directories in ``setup.py`` and the rest should be as easy as running ``python setup.py install``.\r\n\r\nRefer to this document for more details: http://pythonhosted.org/PyMuPDF/installation.html.\r\n\r\nArch Linux\r\n----------\r\nAUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python2-pymupdf/\r\n\r\nUbuntu\r\n------\r\nSince MuPDF's current releases are often delayed in the official repo, you need to build it from source as indicated above. Make sure to add ``-fPIC`` to CFLAGS when compiling.\r\n\r\nWhen MuPDF is ready, edit ``setup.py`` in PyMuPDF and comment out the line of ``library_dirs=[]`` to specify the directory which contains ``libmupdf.a`` and other 3rd party libraries. Remove ``crypto`` from ``libraries`` in ``setup.py`` if it complains.\r\n\r\nAlso do have a look at the respective Wiki in PyMuPDF's GitHub repository.\r\n\r\nOSX\r\n---\r\nFirst please make sure that the dependencies are satisfied: ``brew install mupdf-tools jpeg jbig2dec freetype openssl``\r\n\r\nThen you might need to ``export ARCHFLAGS='-arch x86_64'`` since ``libmupdf.a`` is for x86_64 only.\r\n\r\nFinally, please double check ``setup.py`` before building. Update ``include_dirs`` and ``library_dirs`` where necessary.\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n-------\r\nWe have prepared binaries `here <https://github.com/JorjMcKie/PyMuPDF-optional-material/tree/master/binary_setups>`_, that are suitable for your Windows / Python configuration (32bit / 64bit, Py 2.7 and up, Windows XP and up). Using this option requires downloading the correct 3 MB zip file and nothing else - no MuPDF source / generation, no compiler nor Visual Studio. Please refer to the above mentioned installation instructions.\r\n\r\nIf you however **want to make your own binary**, have a look at this `Wiki page <https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF/wiki/Windows-Binaries-Generation>`_. It explains how to use Visual Studio for generating MuPDF in some detail. This is also the way, how our binaries have been created.\r\n\r\nUsage and Documentation\r\n========================\r\n\r\nYou can render page images and extract text from a variety of document types.\r\n\r\nFor PDF, a broad range of modifications is also possible, including annotations, links, meta information, table of contents, decryption, (de-) compression, joining or splitting files, re-arranging, duplicating, deleting, creating or watermarking pages. The current version 1.11.0 also has added support for PDF embedded files.\r\n\r\nThe underlying graphics library also offers a range of very fast image handling functions which can be used independently from dealing with documents, and which also easily interface with other Python graphics libraries like PIL / Pillow.\r\n\r\nPlease have a look at the basic `demos <https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF/tree/master/demo>`_ or the `examples <https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF/tree/master/examples>`_ which contain complete, working programs.\r\n\r\nYou have a number of options to access **documentation** (made using Sphinx):\r\n\r\n* You can view it online at `PyPI <http://pythonhosted.org/PyMuPDF/>`_.\r\n\r\n* You can download a `Windows compiled html <https://github.com/JorjMcKie/PyMuPDF-optional-material/tree/master/doc/PyMuPDF.chm>`_.\r\n\r\n* You can download a `PDF <https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF/tree/master/doc/pymupdf.pdf>`_.\r\n\r\n* You can download a `HTML ZIP file <https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF/tree/master/doc/html.zip>`_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarlier Versions\r\n=================\r\n* `PyMuPDF Version 1.10.0 <https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF/tree/1.10.0>`_ which supports MuPDF v1.10a\r\n* `PyMuPDF 1.9.3 <https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF/releases/tag/v1.9.3>`_, which is also based on MuPDF v1.9a\r\n\r\n* `Code compatible with MuPDF v1.9a <https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF/releases/tag/v1.9.2>`_\r\n\r\n* `Code compatible with MuPDF v1.8 <https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF/releases/tag/v1.8>`_\r\n\r\n* `Code compatible with MuPDF v1.7a <https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF/releases/tag/v1.7>`_\r\n\r\n* `Code compatible with MuPDF v1.2 <https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF/releases/tag/v1.2>`_\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\n\r\nPlease direct comments or any issues to either the bug tracker of GitHub or e-mail the authors\r\n`Ruikai Liu`_, `Jorj X.
