    "description": "Implements a counter whose value decays over time\n\nDecayCounter() objects store a float, which decays over time with the given decay rate.\nDecay rate is expressed as a half-life, ie. after half_life seconds, the value is halved.\nThe decay is automatically accounted for on a get() operation, no background thread or other out-of-band\ntimekeeping is used.\n\nNote that while a set() operation is provided, it is not safe to use in a read-modify-write pattern,\nas you would lose the decay that should have occurred between the read and the write.\nYou should instead use modify() for such operations, which takes a callable that should perform the operation\nand return the result.\n\nIf one of the following libraries is installed, monotonic time will be used by default:\n\tMonotime\n\tMonoclock\n\tmonotonic\nIf you would like to enforce this as a requirement, use the monotonic=True flag.\nConversely, if you would like to force the use of wall clock time.time() even when monotonic is available,\nuse monotonic=False. Note this is probably a bad idea\n(for example, your values will jump up wildly if the system time is changed backwards).",
