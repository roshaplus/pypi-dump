    "description": "# Python for Android\n\nPython for Android is a project to create your own Python distribution\nincluding the modules you want, and create an apk including python,\nlibs, and your application.\n\nThese tools were recently rewritten to provide a new, easier to use\nand extend interface. If you are looking for the old toolchain with\ndistribute.sh and build.py, it is still available at\nhttps://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/tree/old_toolchain, and\nissues and PRs relating to this branch are still accepted. However,\nthe new toolchain contains all the same functionality via the built in\npygame bootstrap.\n\nFor documentation and support, see:\n\n- Website: http://python-for-android.rtfd.org/\n- Mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kivy-users or\n  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/python-android.\n\nBroad goals of the revamp project include:\n\n- \u2713 Replace the old toolchain with a more extensible pythonic one\n- \u2713 Support SDL2\n- \u2713 Support multiple bootstraps (user-chosen java + NDK code, e.g. for\n  multiple graphics backends or non-Kivy projects)\n- \u2713 Support python3 (it finally works!)\n- (WIP) Support some kind of binary distribution, including on windows (semi-implemented, just needs finishing)\n- \u2713 Be a standalone Pypi module (not on pypi yet but setup.py works)\n- \u2713 Support multiple architectures (full multiarch builds not complete, but arm and x86 with different config both work now)\n\nWe are currently working to stabilise all parts of the toolchain and\nadd more features. Support for pygame-based APKs is almost feature\ncomplete with the old toolchain. Testing and contributions are\nwelcome.\n\nThe recent replacement of the master branch with the revamp will have\nrendered most/all PRs invalid. Please retarget revamp PRs on the\nmaster branch, or PRs for the old toolchain on the old_toolchain\nbranch.\n\n# Documentation\n\nFollow the\n[quickstart instructions](https://python-for-android.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart/)\nto install and begin creating APK.\n\nQuick instructions to start would be:\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android.git\n\nThe executable is called `python-for-android` or `p4a` (both are\nequivalent). To test that the installation worked, try\n\n    python-for-android recipes\n\nThis should return a list of recipes available to be built.\n\nTo build any distributions, you need to set up the Android SDK and NDK\nas described in the documentation linked above.\n\nIf you did this, to build an APK with SDL2 you can try e.g.\n\n    p4a apk --requirements=kivy --private /home/asandy/devel/planewave_frozen/ --package=net.inclem.planewavessdl2 --name=\"planewavessdl2\" --version=0.5 --bootstrap=sdl2\n\nFor full instructions and parameter options, see the documentation\nlinked above.\n\n# Known missing stuff from P4A\n\nRelating to all bootstraps:\n- Some recipes/components aren't stripped properly of doc etc.\n- Downloaded file md5 and headers aren't checked\n\nRelating to SDL2 only:\n- Public dir installation\n- Keyboard height getter\n- Billing support\n- Kivy Launcher build (can now be implemented as a bootstrap...maybe?)\n- Probably some other stuff\n\nHere are some specific things relating to changes in p4a itself since\nthe reference commit that the revamp is based on:\n\n# Current status\n\npython-for-android is fully ready for use. We are working towards a versioned release.\n\n# Development notes\n\nOriginal reference commit of p4a master was\n7c8d4ce9db384528f7ea83e0841fe2464a558db8 - possibly some things after\nthis need adding to the new toolchain. Some of the major later\nadditons, including ctypes in the python build, have already been\nmerged here.\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nIf you need assistance, you can ask for help on our mailing list:\n\n* User Group: https://groups.google.com/group/kivy-users\n* Email: kivy-users@googlegroups.com\n\nWe also have an IRC channel:\n\n* Server: irc.freenode.net\n* Port: 6667, 6697 (SSL only)\n* Channel: #kivy\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nWe love pull requests and discussing novel ideas. Check out our\n[contribution guide](http://kivy.org/docs/contribute.html) and\nfeel free to improve Python for Android.\n\nThe following mailing list and IRC channel are used exclusively for\ndiscussions about developing the Kivy framework and its sister projects:\n\n* Dev Group: https://groups.google.com/group/kivy-dev\n* Email: kivy-dev@googlegroups.com\n\nIRC channel:\n\n* Server: irc.freenode.net\n* Port: 6667, 6697 (SSL only)\n* Channel: #kivy-dev\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nPython for Android is released under the terms of the MIT License.
