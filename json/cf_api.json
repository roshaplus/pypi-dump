    "description": "# Python Cloud Foundry API Client\n\nThis module provides a pure Python interface to the Cloud Foundry APIs.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe following examples should be enough to get you started using this library.\n\n```python\n# Initializing the Cloud Controller client\n\nfrom getpass import getpass\nimport cf_api\nimport json\n\ncloud_controller = 'https://api.yourcloudfoundry.com'\ndeploy_client_id = 'cf'\ndeploy_client_secret = ''\nverify_ssl = True\nusername = 'youser'\npassword = getpass('Password: ').strip()\n\ncc = cf_api.new_cloud_controller(\n    cloud_controller,\n    client_id=deploy_client_id,\n    client_secret=deploy_client_secret,\n    username=username,\n    password=password,\n).set_verify_ssl(verify_ssl)\n    \n    \n# List all organizations\nreq = cc.organizations()\nres = req.get()\norgs = res.resources\nfor r in orgs:\n    print('org', r.guid, r.name)\n    \n    \n# List all spaces\nres = cc.spaces().get()\nspaces = res.resources\nfor r in spaces:\n    print('space', r.guid, r.name)\n\n\n# List all applications\n\nres = cc.apps().get()\napps = res.resources\nfor r in apps:\n    print('app', r.guid, r.name)\n\n\n# Find an app by it's org/space/name\n\norg_name = 'your_org'\nspace_name = 'your_space'\napp_name = 'your_app'\n\n# find your org by name\nres = cc.organizations().get_by_name(org_name)\n# you can access the first array resource using the `resource` attribute\nyour_org = res.resource\n\n# find your space by name within your org\nres = cc.request(your_org.spaces_url).get_by_name(space_name)\nyour_space = res.resource\n\n# find your app by name within your space\nres = cc.request(your_space.apps_url).get_by_name(app_name)\nyour_app = res.resource\nprint('your_app', your_app)\n\n\n# Find an app by it's GUID\n# \n# Note that this same pattern applies to all Cloud Controller resources\n#\n\nres = cc.apps(your_app.guid).get()\n# you can also use the `resource` attribute to access a response with a \n# non-array result\nyour_same_app = res.resource\nprint('your_same_app', your_same_app)\n\n\n# Find a stack by name\nyour_stack = 'some_stack'\nres = cc.stacks().get_by_name(your_stack)\nstack = res.resource\n\n\n# Create an app\nyour_buildpack = 'some_buildpack'\ncommand = 'python server.py'\nres = cc.apps().set_params(\n    name=app_name,\n    space_guid=your_space.guid,\n    stack_guid=stack.guid,\n    buildpack=your_buildpack,\n    command=command,\n    health_check_type='port',\n    health_check_timeout=60,\n    instances=2,\n    memory=512,\n    disk_quota=512\n).post()\nprint('new app', res.data)\n\n\n# Upload the bits for an app\nmy_zipfile = '/tmp/app.zip'\nwith open(my_zipfile, 'r') as f:\n    res = cc.apps(your_app.guid, 'bits')\\\n        .set_query(async='true')\\\n        .add_field('resources', json.dumps([]))\\\n        .add_file('application', 'application.zip', f, 'application/zip')\\\n        .put()\n    print(res.data)\n```\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nThe library is also configurable via environment variables.\n\n| Variable | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `PYTHON_CF_URL` | This is the cloud controller base URL. **Do not include a trailing slash on the URL.**\n| `PYTHON_CF_CLIENT_ID` | This is the UAA client ID the library should use.\n| `PYTHON_CF_CLIENT_SECRET` | This is the UAA client secret the library should use.\n| `PYTHON_CF_IGNORE_SSL` | This indicates whether to verify SSL certs. Default is false. Set to `true` to ignore SSL verification.\n| `CF_DOCKER_PASSWORD` | This variable optionally provides the Docker user's password if a docker image is being used. This variable is not necessarily required to use a docker image.\n\nAn example library usage with these variables set would look like this:\n\n```python\n# env vars might be set as follows\n# PYTHON_CF_URL=https://api.cloudfoundry.com\n# PYTHON_CF_CLIENT_ID=my_client_id\n# PYTHON_CF_CLIENT_SECRET=my_client_secret\n\nimport cf_api\n\n# no args are required when the above env vars are detected\ncc = cf_api.new_cloud_controller()\nres = cc.apps().get()\n# ...\n\n# the same principle applies to new_uaa()\nuaa = cf_api.new_uaa()\n# ...\n```\n\n## Log in with Cloud Foundry Authorization Code\n\nThe following functions may be used to implement login with Cloud Foundry via Authorization Codes.\n\nThe function `get_openid_connect_url()` shows how to build UAA URL to which the user can be \nredirected in order to log in.\n  \nThe function `verify_code()` can be used when the user successfully logs in and UAA redirects back\nto redirect_uri with the `code` attached. Pass the code and original redirect_uri into this function\nin order to get the OAuth2 Token and to also verify the signature of the JWT.\n\nThis particular example applies to OpenID Connect.\n\n```python\nimport cf_api\n\ncc = 'https://api.yourcloudfoundry.com'\nclient_id = 'yourclient'\nclient_secret = 'yoursecret'\nresponse_type = 'code'\n\ndef get_openid_connect_url(redirect_uri):\n    return cf_api\\\n        .new_uaa(cc=cc, client_id=client_id, client_secret=client_secret, no_auth=True)\\\n        .authorization_code_url(response_type, scope='openid', redirect_uri=redirect_uri)\n\n\ndef verify_code(code, redirect_uri):\n    uaa = cf_api.new_uaa(cc=cc, client_id=client_id, client_secret=client_secret, no_auth=True)\n    res = uaa.authorization_code(code, response_type, redirect_uri)\n    data = res.data\n    uaa.verify_token(data['id_token'], audience=uaa.client_id)\n    return data\n```\n\n## Deploy an Application\n\nThe `cf_api.deploy_manifest` module may be used to deploy a Cloud Foundry app. The \nfollowing snippet demonstrates the usage for deploying an app.\n\n```bash\ncd path/to/your/project\npython -m cf_api.deploy_manifest \\\n  --cloud-controller https://api.yourcloudfoundry.com \\\n  -u youser -o yourg -s yourspace \\\n  -m manifest.yml -v -w\n# For the CLI usage of deploy_manifest, you may also set\n#   the CF_REFRESH_TOKEN environment variable as a substitute\n#   for collecting username and password\n```\n\nThis module may also be used programmatically.\n \n```python\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nimport cf_api\nfrom getpass import getpass\nfrom cf_api.deploy_manifest import Deploy\n\ncc = cf_api.new_cloud_controller(\n    'https://api.yourcloudfoundry.com',\n    username='youruser',\n    password=getpass().strip(),\n    client_id='cf',\n    client_secret='',\n    verify_ssl=True\n)\n\nmanifest_filename = 'path/to/manifest.yml'\n\napps = Deploy.parse_manifest(manifest_filename, cc)\n\nfor app in apps:\n    app.set_debug(True)\n    app.set_org_and_space('yourorg', 'yourspace')\n    print (app.push()) \n    # print (app.destroy(destroy_routes=True))\n```\n\n## Deploy a Service\n\nThe `cf_api.deploy_service` module may be used to deploy a Cloud Foundry service to a space. The \nfollowing snippet demonstrates the usage for deploying a service.\n\n```bash\ncd path/to/your/project\npython -m cf_api.deploy_service \\\n  --cloud-controller https://api.yourcloudfoundry.com \\\n  -u youser -o yourg -s yourspace \\\n  --name your-custom-service-name --service-name cf-service-type \\\n  --service-plan cf-service-type-plan -v -w\n```\n\nThis module may also be used programmatically.\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nimport cf_api\nfrom getpass import getpass\nfrom cf_api.deploy_service import DeployService\n\ncc = cf_api.new_cloud_controller(\n    'https://api.yourcloudfoundry.com',\n    username='youruser',\n    password=getpass().strip(),\n    client_id='cf',\n    client_secret='',\n    verify_ssl=True\n)\n\nservice = DeployService(cc)\\\n    .set_debug(True)\\\n    .set_org_and_space('yourorg', 'yourspace')\n    \nresult = service.create('my-custom-db', 'database-service', 'small-database-plan')\nprint(result)\n```\n\n## Query a Space\n\nThe `cf_api.deploy_space` module provides a convenience interface for working with Cloud Foundry\nspaces. The module provides read-only (i.e. GET requests only) support for the Cloud Controller API\nendpoints scoped to a specific space i.e. /v2/spaces/<space_guid>/(routes|service_instances|apps).\nThe following snippet demonstrates the usage for listing apps for in a space.\n\n```bash\ncd path/to/your/project\npython -m cf_api.deploy_space \\\n  --cloud-controller https://api.yourcloudfoundry.com \\\n  -u youser -o yourg -s yourspace apps\n```\n\nThis module may also be used programmatically.\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nimport cf_api\nfrom getpass import getpass\nfrom cf_api.deploy_space import Space\n\ncc = cf_api.new_cloud_controller(\n    'https://api.yourcloudfoundry.com',\n    username='youruser',\n    password=getpass().strip(),\n    client_id='cf',\n    client_secret='',\n    verify_ssl=True\n)\n\nspace = Space(cc, org_name='yourorg', space_name='yourspace')\n\n# create the space\nspace.create()\n\n# destroy the space\nspace.destroy()\n\n# make a Cloud Controller request within the space\napps_in_the_space = space.request('apps').get()\n\n# deploys an application to this space\nspace.deploy_manifest('/path/to/manifest.yml') # push the app\nspace.wait_manifest('/path/to/manifest.yml') # wait for the app to start\nspace.destroy_manifest('/path/to/manifest.yml') # destroy the app\n\napp = space.get_app_by_name('yourappname') # find an application by its name within the space\n\n# deploy a service in this space\nspace.get_deploy_service().create('my-custom-db', 'database-service', 'small-database-plan')\nservice = space.get_service_instance_by_name('my-custom-db') # find a service by its name within the space\n```\n\n## Tail Application Logs\n\nThe `cf_api.logs_util` module may be used to tail Cloud Foundry application logs. Both\n`recentlogs` and `stream` modes are supported. The following snippet demonstrates the usage for\nlisting recent logs and tailing app logs simultaneously.\n\n```bash\ncd path/to/your/project\npython -m cf_api.logs_util \\\n  --cloud-controller https://api.yourcloudfoundry.com \\\n  -u youser -o yourg -s yourspace -a yourapp \\\n  -r -t\n```\n\nThis module may also be used programmatically.\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nimport cf_api\nfrom getpass import getpass\nfrom cf_api import dropsonde_util\n\ncc = cf_api.new_cloud_controller(\n    'https://api.yourcloudfoundry.com',\n    username='youruser',\n    password=getpass().strip(),\n    client_id='cf',\n    client_secret='',\n    verify_ssl=True,\n    init_doppler=True\n)\n\napp_guid = 'your-app-guid'\napp = cc.apps(app_guid).get().resource\n\n# get recent logs\nlogs = cc.doppler.apps(app.guid, 'recentlogs').get().multipart\n\n# convert log envelopes from protobuf to dict\nlogs = [dropsonde_util.parse_envelope_protobuf(log) for log in logs]\n\nprint(logs)\n\n# stream logs\nws = cc.doppler.ws_request('apps', app.guid, 'stream')\ntry:\n    ws.connect()\n    ws.watch(lambda m: print(dropsonde_util.parse_envelope_protobuf(m)))\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(e)\nfinally:\n    ws.close()\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Module\n\n| Function | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| decode_jwt() | Decodes a UAA access token (which are in JWT format) |\n| new_cloud_controller() | Creates a new instance of the `CloudController` class |\n| new_uaa() | Creates a new instance of the `UAA` class |\n\n### Classes\n\n#### CloudController\n\nThis class provides the primary interface to the Cloud Controller API.\nSee the [Cloud Controller docs](http://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org) for a \ncomplete list of APIs.\n\n| Function | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| update_tokens(res) | Updates the bearer token on this instance |\n| info() | Returns basic Cloud Foundry info |\n| apps() | Build a request for /apps/... endpoint |\n| app_usage_events() | Build a request for /app_usage_events/... endpoint |\n| service_instances() | Build a request for /service_instances/... endpoint |\n| services() | Build a request for /services/... endpoint |\n| blobstores() | Build a request for /blobstores/... endpoint |\n| buildpacks() | Build a request for /buildpacks/... endpoint |\n| events() | Build a request for /events/... endpoint |\n| quota_definitions() | Build a request for /quota_definitions/... endpoint |\n| organizations() | Build a request for /organizations/... endpoint |\n| routes() | Build a request for /routes/... endpoint |\n| security_groups() | Build a request for /security_groups/... endpoint |\n| service_bindings() | Build a request for /service_bindings/... endpoint |\n| service_brokers() | Build a request for /service_brokers/... endpoint |\n| service_plan_visibilities() | Build a request for /service_plan_visibilities/... endpoint |\n| service_plans() | Build a request for /service_plans/... endpoint |\n| shared_domains() | Build a request for /shared_domains/... endpoint |\n| space_quota_definitions() | Build a request for /space_quota_definitions/... endpoint |\n| spaces() | Build a request for /spaces/... endpoint |\n| stacks() | Build a request for /stacks/... endpoint |\n| users() | Build a request for /users/... endpoint |\n| resource_match() | Build a request for /resource_match endpoint |\n\n#### UAA\n\nThis class provides the primary interface to the UAA API.
