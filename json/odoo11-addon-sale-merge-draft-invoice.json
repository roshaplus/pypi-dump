This module\nextends the grouping to also consider any pre-existing draft invoices and merge\nthem.\n\nThis feature is activated from Sales / Settings and assigned to the company\nsettings.\n\nUsers assigned to the group 'Change sale to invoice merge proposal'\nhave the possibility to activate or deactivate this option at the moment of\ninvoicing.\n\nIf you also need to group on fields other than partner and currency, the OCA\nmodule sale_invoice_group_method allows you to specify alternative grouping\nmethods and is fully compatible with this module.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\n#. Go to 'Sales / Configuration / Settings'\n#. In 'Quotations & Sales' go to 'Invoices' and activate the option 'Merge\n   new invoices with existing draft ones'.\n#. Go to 'Settings / Users / Groups' and assign to the group 'Change sale\n   to invoice merge proposal' all the users that can have the possibility to\n   activate/deactivate the option of merging the new invoice with existing\n   draft ones.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nCreate an Invoice from a single Sale Order\n------------------------------------------\n\n#. Go to 'Sales / Sales / Sales Orders'.\n#. Select or click in a sale order.\n#. Go to 'Action' and click 'Invoice Order' or press the button 'Invoice\n   Order' if you are inside a sale order. The result, in case there are draft\n   invoices that correspond to this one, is an existing draft invoice with\n   the new lines added.\n   In the wizard, if the user belongs to the group 'Change sale to invoice merge\n   proposal', the option to deactivate the 'Merge with draft invoices' is\n   given. In this case, the result is a new draft invoice is created\n   following the usual behaviour.\n\nCreate Invoices from a group of Sales Orders\n--------------------------------------------\n\n#. Go to 'Sales / Sales / Sales Orders'.\n#. Select all the sales orders with status 'To invoice'.\n#. Go to 'Action' and click 'Invoice Order'. As a result, new draft invoices\n   will be merged with existing ones when corresponding.\n   In the wizard, if the user belongs to the group 'Change sale to invoice merge\n   proposal', the option to deactivate the 'Merge with draft invoices' is\n   given. In this case, the result is a new draft invoice for every sale\n   order following the usual behaviour.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/167/11.0\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/purchase-workflow/issues>`_.
