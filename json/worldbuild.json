    "description": "=========================================\nWorld Build\n=========================================\n\n    \n(Planning) Tools for computational world building\n\nOverview\n--------------------------------\nWorldbuild contains tools to build worlds and store the metadata around that, including objects, history, animals, vegetation.\n\nYou provide a map of your world and annotate it via a YAML file to define towns with locations - the wiki tool extracts subset of the image to for each town.\n\nYou can add additional information to build a rich history around your world.\n\n\nQuick Start\n=========================================\n\nCopy your map file (JPG) or scan a hand drawn map.\n\n.. image:: ./doc/map_sample.jpg\n\n\nCreate a YAML file with the following sections\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    wiki: Yes\n    world_name: Alrona\n    contents:\n        - races\n        - settlements\n    maps: [alrona-pen-coloured.jpg]\n\n\nYou need to have a root section for each element in contents, and there needs to be a name and desc element at the minimum. \n\n.. code:: python\n    \n    settlements:\n      - name: Draeton \n        continent: Sharnia\n        coords_x_y: [66,58]\n        desc: >\n            This is the largest city on the East side of Sharnia. 3,000 men live in this strongly \n            defended city\n      - name: Ambyle\n        continent: Sharnia\n        coords_x_y: [64,58]\n        desc: >\n            Farming town East of Draeton, known for their famous weekend markets selling exotic produce grown in the warm regions north of the Eastern Desert\n\nThen modify the params and run the wiki.py program to generate the HTML version of your world.\n\nThe main page looks like \n\n.. image:: ./doc/web_index.jpg\n\nThe settlements page shows the description from the yaml file, and also a section of the map based on the coords_x_y parameter\n\n.. image:: ./doc/web_settlements.jpg\n\n\nYou can extend the wiki with as many sections as you like and each entry can include a file section to import a text (or html) file to be included in that page.\n    \n\n\nFuture Functionality\n============================\nThis isn't, and will never be a true rendered 3d representation of a world, rather a macro level world builder for hobbyists and gamers.\n\nFuture version will include ability to scan and convert images of world maps, and manage of the narrative of the world. \n\nTerrain Generation [Random Generation] (in progress)\nUse planet.py to create a random planet\nShould also allow modifying and saving to proper data format with layers for plants, etc\n\nScan from picture\nTakes an image of a scanned map and extracts the content into multiple layers based on image clustering like hills and trees.  Users can tweak how it converts.\n\nObject builder\n- start simple with a name and some stats and can them flesh out details with images icons for map right up to 3d blender models or sgi cad models.\n\nCreature Builder\nspecify creatures \nsimple = rogue specs + icon for moving on 2d map\ncomplex = armour and weapon tables like wow - basic image\npath finding - send AI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s around your world to map paths",
