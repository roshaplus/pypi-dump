    "description": "fluxpyt\n=======\n\nThis package is developed to perform stationary metabolic flux analysis \ncalculations for estimation of intracellular flux distribution.\nFluxPyt is written in python3. The anaconda package list is provided in \nthe requirements.txt file.\n\nThe package was developed as a part of PhD work of Desai Trunil Shamrao at:\n\nSystems Biology for Biofuels Group\nGroup Leader, Dr. Shireesh Srivastava\nInternational Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB),\nAruna Asaf Ali Marg,\nNew Delhi.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n================\nThe PhD fellowship of Trunil is funded by the Council for Scientific \nand Industrial Research (CSIR).\nThe project is funded by Department of Biotechnology (DBT)\n\nThe author specially thanks Ahmad for being there to discuss issues and to \nhelp get rid of few bugs.\n\n\n\nInstallation:\n============\nDownload and install Anaconda distribution (version 3.4.4.0 was used in this tutorial).\nIt has most of the packages essential for running FluxPyt.\nFor installing packages that are not present in the Anaconda distribution, install them separately. Following are the instructions:\nOpen an Anaconda command prompt.\nClick on Windows start button.\nType 'anaconda'. A link to open Anaconda command promt will be shown.\n\nType following commands to install packages:\n\n>> conda install -c sjpfenninger glpk\n>> conda install -c conda-forge lmfit\n>> conda install csvkit\n\nIf additional packages are required, read how to install packages using conda.\nType following command for installing FluxPyt\n\n>> pip install fluxpyt\n\n\n\n",
