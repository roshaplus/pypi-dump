    "description": "mike\n====\n\n**mike** is a Python utility to easily deploy multiple versions of your\n`MkDocs <http://www.mkdocs.org>`__-powered docs to a Git branch,\nsuitable for deploying to Github via ``gh-pages``.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nLike most Python projects, mike uses\n`setuptools <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/>`__, so you can\ninstall it like most any other Python package:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    pip install mike\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nBuilding Your Docs\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBefore your first build, you'll probably want to add the version\nselector to your MkDocs config. Simply run the following command in the\ndirectory with your ``mkdocs.yml`` file to install the extra CSS and JS\nfiles to your docs:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    mike install-extras\n\nmike is designed to produce one version of your docs at a time. That\nway, you can easily deploy a new version without touching any older\nversions of your docs; this can be especially important if your old docs\nare no longer buildable with the newest version of MkDocs (or if they\nweren't built with MkDocs at all!). To deploy the current version of\nyour docs, simply run:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    mike deploy [version]\n\nWhere ``[version]`` is the current version of your project, represented\nhowever you like (I recommend using ``[major].[minor]`` and excluding\nthe patch number). You can also pass aliases to the ``deploy`` command\nto host a particularly-relevant version of your docs somewhere special\n(e.g. ``latest``):\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    mike deploy [version] [alias]...\n\nIf you'd like to specify a title for this version that doesn't match the\nversion string, you can pass ``-t TITLE``/``--title=TITLE`` as well.\n\nFinally, to push your docs to a remote branch, simply add\n``-p``/``--push`` to your command. (Note: this will likely become the\ndefault eventually.)\n\nDeleting Docs\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSometimes you need to delete an old version of your docs, either because\nyou made a mistake or you're pruning unsupported versions. You can do\nthis via the ``delete`` subcommand:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    mike delete [version-or-alias]...\n\nIf you'd like to completely wipe the contents of your docs branch, just\nrun ``mike delete --all``. Like ``deploy`` above, you can specify\n``-p``/``--push`` to push this commit as well.\n\nListing Docs\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you ever need to see the list of all currently-deployed doc versions,\nyou can run:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    mike list\n\nSetting the Default Version\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWith all the versions of docs you have, you may want to set a *default*\nversion so that people going to the root of your site are redirected to\nthe latest version of the docs:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    mike set-default [version-or-alias]\n\nLike ``deploy`` and ``delete`` above, you can specify ``-p``/``--push``\nto\\` push this commit as well.\n\nRenaming a Version\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAs you update your docs, you may want to rename the title of a\nparticular version. For example, your ``1.0`` docs might have the title\n``1.0.0``, and when you release a new patch, you want to update the\ntitle to ``1.0.1``. You can do this with the rename command:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    mike rename [version-or-alias] [title]\n\nMore Details\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFor more details on the available options (e.g. specifying which branch\nto push to), consult the ``--help`` command for mike.\n\nFor Theme Authors\n-----------------\n\nIf you'd like to provide support for mike in your theme, you just need\nto fetch ``versions.json`` and build a version selector.\n``versions.json`` looks like this:\n\n.. code:: js\n\n    [\n      {\"version\": \"1.0\", \"title\": \"1.0.1\", \"aliases\": [\"latest\"]},\n      {\"version\": \"0.9\", \"title\": \"0.9\", \"aliases\": []}\n    ]\n\nTo see an example of how to work with this, check the\n```mike/themes/mkdocs`` <mike/themes/mkdocs>`__ directory.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis project is licensed under the `BSD 3-clause license <LICENSE>`__.\n\n\n",
