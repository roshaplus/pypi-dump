It is a very simple project built with ``Flask``, and the\nMarkdown functionality is implemented with `Flask-PageDown`_. Currently,\nthere is very little code of my own devicing in the project itself, but\nfuture versions will include up- and downloading of ``.md`` files.\n\nPurpose of the project\n======================\nThe purpose of this project is mostly to get more comfortable with Flask.\nI had a half-decent idea and decided to go with it, even though it has been\ndone many times before.\n\nRequirements\n============\nApart from the requirements listed in `requirements.txt`_, you will also need\na web browser of your choice.\n\nInstall\n=======\nOption 1: Install from PyPi with ``pip``\n----------------------------------------\nThe latest release of ``browser-markdown-editor`` is on PyPi, and can thus be installed as usual with ``pip``.\nI strongly discourage system-wide ``pip`` installs (i.e. ``sudo pip install <package>``), as this\nmay land you with incompatible packages in a very short amount of time. A per-user install\ncan be done like this:\n\n1. Execute ``pip install --user browser-markdown-editor`` to install the package.\n2. Verify the installation by typing ``browser-markdown-editor`` on the command line.\n   It should give you some usage options.\n3. If step 2 fails, it is probably because ``$HOME/.local/bin`` is not on your ``PATH`` variable.\n   Add it for the current session by executing ``export PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin\"``. Add that\n   line to your ``.bashrc`` (or equivalent) for this to happen automagically when starting a shell.\n\nOption 2: Clone the repo and the install with ``pip``\n-----------------------------------------------------\nIf you want the dev version, you will need to clone the repo, as only release versions are uploaded\nto PyPi. Unless you are planning to work on this yourself, I suggest going with the release version.\n\n1. Clone the repo with ``git``:\n    - ``git clone https://github.com/slarse/browser-markdown-editor``\n2. ``cd`` into the project root directory and install with ``pip``.\n    - ``pip install --user .``, this will create a local install for the current user.\n    - Or just ``pip install .`` if you use ``virtualenv``.\n    - For development, use ``pip install -e .`` in a ``virtualenv``.\n3. Verify the installation by typing ``browser-markdown-editor`` on the command line.\n   It should give you some usage options.\n4. If step 3 fails, it is probably because ``$HOME/.local/bin`` is not on your ``PATH`` variable.\n   Add it for the current session by executing ``export PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin\"``. Add that\n   line to your ``.bashrc`` (or equivalent) for this to happen automagically when starting a shell.\n\nHow to run\n==========\nTo start the server, follow the install instructions and then execute \n``browser-markdown-editor runserver``. The host ip will default to\n``127.0.0.1`` and port to ``5000``. These can be specified by providing\n``-h x.x.x.x`` and ``-p n`` options, where ``x.x.x.x`` is the host ip and\n``n`` is the port to listen to.\n\nLicense\n=======\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.
