It\r\nwill be used to generate the project webpage on PyPI, and should be written for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nTypical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic\r\nusage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not\r\na good idea, although a simple \"What's New\" section for the most recent version\r\nmay be appropriate.",
