It's taken longer to stabilize\npantsd than we initially anticipated, and while we're very nearly comfortable with enabling it\nby default, we believe that we should be prioritizing frequent stable minor releases over\nreleases being tied to particular features.

This is in service of allowing for\nzero-or-more pants.ini/config files in the future.\n\nAdditionally, there is now support for validating that all options defined in a\npants.ini file are valid options. Passing or configuring '--verify-config' will trigger\nthis validation. To allow global options to be verified, a new [GLOBAL] section is now the\nrecommend place to specify global options. This differentiates them from [DEFAULT] options,\nwhich may be used as template values in other config sections, and thus cannot be verified.\n\nAPI Changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Set public api markers

Most features you'd expect are implemented\nincluding a `buildgen.go` task that can maintain your Go BUILD files as inferred from just\n`go_binary` target definitions.  Yet to come is `doc` goal integration and an option to wire\nin-memory `buildgen.go` as an implicit bootstrap task in any pants run that includes Go targets.\n\nAlso in this release is improved control over the tools pants uses, in particular JVM selection\ncontrol.\n\nAPI Changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Remove deprecated `[compile.java]` options.\n  `RB #2678 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2678>`_\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n* Better caching for Python interpreters and requirements.\n  `RB #2679 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2679>`_\n\n* Fixup use of removed flag `compile.java --target` in integration tests.\n  `RB #2680 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2680>`_\n\n* Add support for fetching Go test deps.\n  `RB #2671 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2671>`_\n\nNew Features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Integrate Go with the binary goal.\n  `RB #2681 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2681>`_\n\n* Initial support for Go BUILD gen.\n  `RB #2676 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2676>`_\n\n* Adding jdk_paths option to jvm subsystem.\n  `RB #2657 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2657>`_\n\n* Allow specification of kwargs that are not currently known.\n  `RB #2662 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2662>`_\n\n* Allow os name map in binary_util to be configured externally\n  `RB #2663 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2663>`_\n\nSmall improvements, Refactoring and Tooling\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* [pantsd] Watchman & StreamableWatchmanClient\n  `RB #2649 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2649>`_\n\n* Upgrade the default Go distribution to 1.5.\n  `RB #2669 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2669>`_\n\n* Align JmakeCompile error messages with reality.\n  `RB #2682 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2682>`_\n\n* Fixing BUILD files which had integration tests running in :all.\n  `RB #2664 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2664>`_\n\n* Remove log options from the zinc Setup to fix performance issue\n  `RB #2666 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2666>`_\n\n0.0.43 (8/19/2015)\n------------------\n\nRelease Notes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis release makes the isolated jvm compile strategy viable out-of-the-box for use with large\ndependency graphs. Without it, `test.junit` and `run.jvm` performance slows down significantly\ndue to the large number of loose classfile directories.\n\nPlease try it out in your repo by grabbing a copy of `pants.ini.isolated\n<https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/pants.ini.isolated>`_ and using a command like::\n\n    ./pants --config-override=pants.ini.isolated test examples/{src,tests}/{scala,java}/::\n\nYou'll like the results.  Just update your own `pants.ini` with the pants.ini.isolated settings to\nuse it by default!\n\nIn the medium term, we're interested in making the isolated strategy the default jvm compilation\nstrategy, so your assistance and feedback is appreciated!\n\nSpecial thanks to Stu Hood and Nick Howard for lots of work over the past months to get this point.\n\nAPI Changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* A uniform way of expressing Task and Subsystem dependencies.\n  `Issue #1957 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/1957>`_\n  `RB #2653 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2653>`_\n\n* Remove some coverage-related options from test.junit.\n  `RB #2639 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2639>`_\n\n* Bump mock and six 3rdparty versions to latest\n  `RB #2633 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2633>`_\n\n* Re-implement suppression of output from compiler workunits\n  `RB #2590 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2590>`_\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n* Improved go remote library support.\n  `RB #2655 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2655>`_\n\n* Shorten isolation generated jar paths\n  `RB #2647 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2647>`_\n\n* Fix duplicate login options when publishing.\n  `RB #2560 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2560>`_\n\n* Fixed no attribute exception in changed goal.\n  `RB #2645 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2645>`_\n\n* Fix goal idea issues with mistakenly identifying a test folder as regular code, missing resources\n  folders, and resources folders overriding code folders.\n  `RB #2046 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2046>`_\n  `RB #2642 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2642>`_\n\nNew Features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Support for running junit tests with different jvm versions.\n  `RB #2651 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2651>`_\n\n* Add support for jar'ing compile outputs in the isolated strategy.\n  `RB #2643 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2643>`_\n\n* Tests for 'java-resoures' and 'java-test-resources' in idea\n  `RB #2046 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2046>`_\n  `RB #2634 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2634>`_\n\nSmall improvements, Refactoring and Tooling\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Filter zinc compilation warnings at the Reporter level\n  `RB #2656 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2656>`_\n\n* Update to sbt 0.13.9.\n  `RB #2629 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2629>`_\n\n* Speeding up jvm-platform-validate step.\n  `Issue #1972 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/1972>`_\n  `RB #2626 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2626>`_\n\n* Added test that failed HTTP responses do not raise exceptions in artifact cache\n  `RB #2624 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2624>`_\n  `RB #2644 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2644>`_\n\n* Tweak to option default extraction for help display.\n  `RB #2640 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2640>`_\n\n* A few small install doc fixes.\n  `RB #2638 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2638>`_\n\n* Detect new package when doing ownership checks.\n  `RB #2637 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2637>`_\n\n* Use os.path.realpath on test tmp dirs to appease OSX.\n  `RB #2635 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2635>`_\n\n* Update the pants install documentation. #docfixit\n  `RB #2631 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/2631>`_\n\n0.0.42 (8/14/2015)\n------------------\n\nRelease Notes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis was #docfixit week, so the release contains more doc and help improvements than usual.\nThanks in particular to Benjy for continued `./pants help` polish!\n\nThis release also add support for golang in the `contrib/go` package.
