It is designed to provide a basic data processing function and making storing, cleaning and analysing the data historically contained in MS Excel files easier to manage.\n\nIt is currently a command line-only tool but future versions may involve a GUI or web interface.\n\n``bcompiler`` performs to types of jobs: **populating** and **compiling**.\n\nInstallation (Windows)\n----------------------\n\nFirst, install Python:\n\n1. To install Python, download installer file from\n   http://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.2/python-3.6.2.exe. Choose to\n   save it to a location on your harddrive, such as your Desktop or Downloads\n   folder.\n2. Run the installer. On the Install Python 3.6.2 Setup screen, ensure \"Add\n   Python 3.6 to PATH\" and \"Install launcher for all users (recommended)\" is checked. Click \"Install Now\".\n3. Open a new command window (Start -> type \"cmd\" in Search box and hit enter).\n\nUpdate pip:\n\n* In command window, type ``python -m pip install -U pip``.\n\n\nInstall git:\n\n1. Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win. The download will begin\n   automatically. Save it to a location on your hardrive, such as your Desktop\n   or Downloads folder.\n2. Run the installer, accepting all default options. If you get a message\n   saying that you cannot run the 64-bit installer, choose the 32-bit installer\n   from the above page.\n\nInstall bcompiler:\n\n* In the command window, type ``pip uninstall bcompiler`` to uninstall any existing installation of\n  ``bcompiler``. \n* In command window, type ``pip install git+https://git@bitbucket.org/mrlemon/bcompiler.git``, or if you choose not to remove ``bcompiler`` first (see point above), then type ``pip install -U git+https://git@bitbucket.org/mrlemon/bcompiler.git`` to upgrade to the latest version of ``bcompiler``.\n\n\nInitialising bcompiler:\n\nbcompiler needs some auxiliary files to run, including a ``datamap.csv`` and ``config.ini`` files. These files are stored in a directory called ``bcompiler`` in your ``Documents`` directory. Before running ``bcompiler``, this directory structure needs to be set up. The auxiliary files also need to be downloaded from a [git repository on Github](https://github.com/departmentfortransport/bcompiler_datamap_files). ``bcompiler`` can do the necessary work to set this up.\n\nIf you already have a  ``~/Documents/bcompiler`` (if using a Linux or Mac OSX\nmachine) or ``MyDocuments\\bcompiler`` (if using a Windows machine) directory,\nthen you do not need to use the following command. If you DO have this\ndirectory in place already, running the following command will ask whether you\nwant to delete this and refresh the auxiliary files from the remote repository.\n\nTo initialise bcompiler:\n\n* In the command window, type ``bcompiler-init``.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE:** Due to a bug in current version of ``bcompiler``, if you try to\nrun ``bcompiler`` and you do not have the necessary auxiliary files installed,\n``bcompiler`` will throw an error. Please ensure you run ``bcompiler-init`` first\nto set up the necessary files.\n\n\n\nKnown bugs and issues\n--------------------\n* See above\n\n\nNews\n====\n\n\n\n\n\n",
