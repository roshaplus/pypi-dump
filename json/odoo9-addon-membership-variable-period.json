    "description": "===============================\nVariable period for memberships\n===============================\n\nCurrent membership module allows to set products that define a fixed period\nfor a membership. This is good when the quotas are defined periodically, and\nwhen you become a member, you are until the end of that quota cycle.\n\nBut a lot of times, membership quotas express an amount of time that you\ngain the membership. For example, one year since the subscription.\n\n\nThis module allows to make it in Odoo, using current membership features,\nand adapting them for this purpose. As now the quota is not attached to a fixed\nperiod, you can also invoice more than one quantity for being a member for\nthe corresponding number of periods.\n\nFinally, a cron has been included that triggers the recalculation of the\nmembership state, allowing to have \"old members\", which doesn't work well\non standard.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nDefine a member product, and select 'Variable periods' in the field\n*Membership type*. You will be able to select them the period for the\nmembership in quantity and interval.\n\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/208/8.0\n\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/vertical_association/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed feedback\n`here <https://github.com/OCA/vertical_association/issues/new?body=module:%20membership_variable_period%0Aversion:%208.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n* Pedro M.
