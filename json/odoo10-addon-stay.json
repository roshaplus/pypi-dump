You can then print the stay report via the wizard *Print Journal* to have a printed paper that you can give to the cook for example.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/181/10.0\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\nThis module doesn't have advanced capacity management : when you create a new stay, it will not check that you have enough capacity for it. It is only when you generate the journal that it will check that each room doesn't have more guest than it's capacity.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/vertical-abbey/issues>`_.
