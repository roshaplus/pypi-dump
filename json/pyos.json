    "description": "pyos\n====\n\nPython SDK for OpenStack Clouds\n\nSee the COPYING file for license and copyright information.\n\n**pyos** is a should work with most OpenStack-based cloud deployments.\nIf your cloud provider has features that are not OpenStack features that\nyou want to use, then pyos is not for you. You should instead use an\nSDK specific to that cloud provider ... just beware that you may be locking\nyourself into their proprietary choices without meaning to.\n\npyos will go out of its way to hide the differences between legit deployment\nchoices that your cloud provider may have made. For instance, your cloud\nprovider may not use the floating-ip extension, but instead will just give\nevery instance you boot an IP. Awesome! It turns out that all you probably\nwanted was an instance that could talk to the internet and you didn't care\none whit about floating-ips in the first place. We'll try to help with that.`\n\nGetting Started with OpenStack\n------------------------------\n\nTo sign up for a cloud account, go to\n\nhttp://www.openstack.org/marketplace/public-clouds/\n\nfind one or more clouds that fits your needs, and go nuts.\n\nIf you are working with an OpenStack deployment, you can find more\ninformation at http://www.openstack.org.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n-  An OpenStack Cloud account\n\n   -  username\n   -  password\n\n-  Python 2.7\n\n   -  pyos is not yet tested yet with other Python versions. Please\n      post feedback about what works or does not work with other\n      versions.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe best way to install **pyos** is by using\n`pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/>`__ to get the latest\nofficial release:\n\n::\n\n    pip install pyos\n\nIf you would like to work with the current development state of pyos,\nyou can install directly from master on StackForge:\n\n::\n\n    pip install git://git.openstack.org/stackforge/pyos.git\n\nIf you are not using\n`virtualenv <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`__, you will need\nto run ``pip install`` as admin using ``sudo``.\n\nYou may also download and install from source. The source code for\n**pyos** is available on\n`StackForge <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/stackforge/pyos`__.\n\nOnce you have the source code, ``cd`` to the base directory of the\nsource and run (using ``sudo``, if necessary):\n\n::\n\n    pip install .\n\nUpdates\n-------\n\nIf you installed **pyos** using pip, it is simple to get the latest\nupdates:\n\n::\n\n    # PyPI\n    pip install --upgrade pyos\n    # GitHub\n    pip install --upgrade git://git.openstack.org/stackforge/pyos.git\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nPlease see the HACKING and CONTRIBUTING.rst files for contribution guidelines.",
