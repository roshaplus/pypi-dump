    "description": "LocalClustering\n====================\n\nThe library implements multiple variations of a local graph clustering algorithm_\nnamed the *Hermina-Janos algorithm* in memory of my beloved grandparents.\n\nBesides the clustering algorithms themselves, the library also contains a cluster\nimplementation (obviously) and utility classes for i) ranking the nodes the algorithms\nhave seen during the clustering process and ii) recording the steps the clustering\nalgorithms have taken.\n\nSee the documents_ included in the library for more details.\n\nLocal clustering\n---------------------\n\nA graph clustering algorithm is called local if its goal is to find the cluster\nof one or more \"source\" nodes without looking at whole graph. In other words\na local algorithm starts out from the source nodes and at each step only looks\nat the nodes it has seen so far and their neighbors to find the cluster the\nsource nodes belong to.\n\nDemo\n---------\n\nThe library contains a demo module that shows the basic usage of this project.\nIf you wish to run the demo, you will first need to install the igraph_ and\ncairo_ libraries and their Python interfaces besides the default dependencies\nof the library.\n\nDependencies\n-----------------\n\nThe library's only requirement is the GraphScraper_ library_ that you can install\nwith pip (``pip install graphscraper``). As a consequence, you will also need\nSQLAlchemy_ or Flask-SQLAlchemy_ to be installed.\n\nLicense - GNU AGPLv3\n-------------------------\n\nThe library is open-sourced under the conditions of the GNU Affero General Public\nLicense_ v3.0, which is the strongest copyleft license. The reason for using this\nlicense is that this library is the \"publication\" of the *Hermina-Janos algorithm*\nand it should be referenced accordingly.\n\nContribution\n-----------------\n\nAny form of constructive contribution is welcome. Besides the usual things\n(feedback, features, bug fixes, tests, additional documentation, etc.), the\nfollowing types of contributions are especially appreciated:\n\n- Algorithm analysis and evaluation (algorithmic complexity, accuracy with different\n  cluster definitions, etc.).\n\n- Analysis of how the weighting coefficients of the connectivity based cluster\n  definition corresponding to the different hierarchy levels relate to each-other\n  in different real-world graphs.\n\n- Implementation of new cluster definitions (modularity or conductance based for example).\n\n- etc.\n\n\n.. _algorithm: https://github.com/volfpeter/localclustering/blob/master/documents/algorithm.rst\n.. _AGPLv3: https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/\n.. _documents: https://github.com/volfpeter/localclustering/tree/master/documents\n.. _Flask-SQLAlchemy: http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/\n.. _library: https://github.com/volfpeter/graphscraper\n.. _License: https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/\n.. _GraphScraper: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/graphscraper\n.. _igraph: http://igraph.org\n.. _cairo: https://www.cairographics.org/pycairo/\n.. _SQLAlchemy: https://www.sqlalchemy.org/\n\n\n",
