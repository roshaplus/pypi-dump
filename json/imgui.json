    "description": "pyimgui,\n========\n\n**pyimgui** is a Cython-based binding for impressive `dear\nimgui <https://github.com/ocornut/imgui>`__ C++ library - a Bloat-free\nImmediate Mode Graphical User Interface.\n\nIt is still unfinished project but I plan to provide minimal\nfully-functional binding in incoming few months. Any help would be\nappreciated.\n\nwhy?\n====\n\n**dear imgui** looks very interesting. I wanted to give it a try becasue\nI was looking for simple GUI solution for my little Python-based game\nengine (to be opensources soon!). Offical **dear imgui** Wiki states\nthat there is some Python binding available\n(`cyimgui <https://github.com/chromy/cyimgui>`__) but it quickly turned\nout that it is incomplete and isn't even barely usable.\n\nIn fact, my initial experimental work on this project based on the\ncyimgui code base. After only three days of developlment my code had\nalmost nothing in common with the **cyimgui**. This fact and vanity made\nme start my own project instead of forking **cyimgui**.\n\ndevelopment tips\n================\n\nAfter you checkout the repository don't forget to initialize all git\nsubmodules using:\n\n::\n\n    git submodule update --init --recursive --remote\n\nThen setup your environment, build extension and install it locally in\nthe *development* mode:\n\n::\n\n    pip install -r doc/requirements-dev.txt\n    python setup.py develop",
