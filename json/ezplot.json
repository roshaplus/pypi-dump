    "description": "A remote procedure interface to Matplotlib.\nThis package allows you to invoke Matplotlib \n     (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net) \nplotting commands over an XML-RPC interface.  The plotting\ncommands are issued by the 'plotclient', sent over XML-RPC,\nthen executed by a (local) 'plotserver'.  The advantage to\nthis is that the plotting commands are executed in a\ncompletely separate process from the client, thus there are\nno issues with getting stuck in the Matplotlib GUI's main\nloop.  Similar to what you get from\"ipython -pylab\", but this \nworks with any Python shell whether it's console-based or \nGUI based.",
