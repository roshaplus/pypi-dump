    "description": "In ecosystems there are three levels of virus development:\r\n\r\n  level 1. virus kills the host\r\n  level 2. virus is neutral towards host\r\n  level 3. virus is useful for the host\r\n\r\nThis is level 3 virus system, implemented in Python language, which goal is to protect its host, to make host owner interested in virus survival. It makes it by striving for the best user experience of owning a virus, it supports and encourages evolution by providing security prection from malicious injection, mutability to resolve/avoid conflicts and removing obstacles from generating a viable population. This may infect and transform your tools, your mindset and may affect your relations. It is experiment that may become dangerous. There is no guarantees, no refunds and no giving back your life.
