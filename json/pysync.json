    "description": "Pysync has both a demonstration implementation of the rsync and related \r\nalgorithms in pure Python, and a high speed librsync Python extension. The pure \r\nPython is not fast and is not optimized, however it does work and provides a \r\nsimple implementation of the algorithm for reference and experimentation. It \r\nincludes a combination of ideas taken from librsync, xdelta, and rsync. The \r\nlibrsync Python extension is less flexible and harder to understand, but is very \r\nfast.",
