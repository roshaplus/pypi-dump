    "description": "ECO Parser\n==========\n\n|Build Status| |Coverage Status|\n\nParse ward lists from Electoral Change Orders on\nhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/\n\nWhat does this package do?\n--------------------------\n\nThis package solves a very specific problem.\n\nLocal Government electoral divisions/wards in the UK are defined by a\npiece of legislation called an Electoral Change Order. An Electoral\nChange Order (ECO) always comes into force the day before the first\nelection which is held using the boundaries it defines. Once this first\nelection has happened, details of the new divisions are fairly easy to\nget hold of. They are published as machine-readable structured data by\norganisations like `Ordnance\nSurvey <https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/boundary-line.html>`__\nand the `Office for National\nStatistics <http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/>`__. If you need\ninformation about divisions that have already been used for one or more\nelections, use one of these sources. In that situation, this tool is\nprobably the least useful route to the information you want.\n\nIn the case where we need to talk about local electoral divisions which\nhave been defined by an ECO but which have not yet been used in an\nelection (i.e: the ECO has been made, but has not yet come into force),\nthe only source for the division names is the ECO legislation itself.\n\nThis package provides some routines to help with parsing ward and\ndivision names from the\n`legislation.gov.uk <http://www.legislation.gov.uk/>`__'s `XML\nAPI <http://www.legislation.gov.uk/developer/contents>`__ outputs (which\nare semi-structured). It is early days, so there are probably going to\nbe some formats we don't support yet. If you find one in new or recent\nlegislation, `raise an\nissue <https://github.com/DemocracyClub/eco-parser/issues>`__.\n\nTL;DR\n~~~~~\n\nIf you need the official names of electoral divisions that are already\nin use, get the data from `OS Boundary\nLine <https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/boundary-line.html>`__,\n`ONS Geography <http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/>`__ or a web service\nlike `mapit <https://mapit.mysociety.org/>`__. This information is\nalready published as convenient machine-readable structured data.\n\nIf you need the official names of electoral divisions that are not in\nuse yet, this package may be able to help you parse them from\nlegislation.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip install eco-parser\n\nPlatform Support\n----------------\n\n``eco-parser`` is tested under Python 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nOn the console\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    eco_parser \"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/1067/schedule/1/made/data.xml\" > out.csv\n\nAs a library\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from eco_parser import EcoParser, ParseError\n\n    p = EcoParser(\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/1067/schedule/1/made/data.xml\")\n\n    try:\n        result = p.parse()\n    except ParseError:\n        raise\n\nLicensing\n---------\n\nThe ``eco-parser`` software is made available under the MIT License.\n\nData Parsed from legislation.gov.uk is covered by the `Open Government\nLicence\nv3 <http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/>`__.\nYour use of the data should comply with it.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nRun the tests locally:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    ./run_tests.py\n\nBuild locally:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    sudo apt-get install pandoc\n    ./build.sh\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/DemocracyClub/eco-parser.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/DemocracyClub/eco-parser\n.. |Coverage Status| image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/DemocracyClub/eco-parser/badge.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/DemocracyClub/eco-parser?branch=master",
