    "description": "CHIP (Chip Handles kIm Packages)\r\n================================\r\n        \r\nThis package is only approved for use with the OpenKIM Virtual Machine at this time.  Chip is a simple package manager with great flexibility that handles the packages needed to run OpenKIM tests and models.  Chip implements lightweight version switching so that multiple versions of a package can be used in different tests and models.  Different versions of a package can even be used in separate processes at the same time.  Chip also supports dependency resolution, consistency checking, and self updating.",
