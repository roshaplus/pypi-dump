    "description": "PsyNeuLink\n==========\n\nPsyNeuLink is a \"block modeling system\" for cognitive neuroscience.\n\nDocumentation is available at https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PsyNeuLink/\n\nPsyNeuLink is alpha software, that is still being actively developed. Although it is useable, and most of the\ndocumented functionality is available, some features may not yet be fully implemented and/or subject to\nmodification.\n\nIf you have trouble installing PsyNeuLink, run into any bugs, or have suggestions\nfor development, please contact psyneulinkhelp@princeton.edu.\n\nPurpose\n-------\n\nPsyNeuLink is a \"block modeling system\" for cognitive neuroscience.  Block modeling systems allow components to be\nconstructed that implement various, possibly disparate functions, and then link them together into a system to\nexamine how they interact.  In PsyNeuLink, components are used to implement the function of brain subsystems and/or\npsychological processes, the interaction of which can then be simulated at the system level.\n\nPsyNeuLink is open source, and meant to be extended. Its goal is to provide an environment for implementing models\nof mind/brain function that are modular, customizable, extensible, disseminable, easily reproducible and clearly\ndocumented.  It does this in a manner that:\n\n - is *computationally general* -- that is, that can implement any desired mechanism or process;\n\n - adheres as closely as possible to the insights and design principles that have been learned in computer science\n   (e.g., function-based, object-oriented programming);\n\n - expresses (as few as possible) *commitments* that reflect general principles of how the mind/brain is organized\n   and operates, without committing to any particular detailed model or theory;\n\n - expresses these commitments in a form that is powerful, easy to use, and familiar to cognitive neuroscientists;\n\n - allows models to be simply and flexibly implemented, using a minimum of coding, and that provides seamless\n   integration of, and interaction among disparate components that can vary in their:\n\n   - granularity of representation and function\n      time-scale of operation\n\n - provides a standard and accessible environment for model comparison, sharing, and documentation;\n\n - has an interface (API) that allows it to be used with other powerful tools for implementing individual components,\n   such as:\n\n   * MatLab (general purpose mathematical tools);\n   * TensorFlow, Teano (ODE's, deep learning);\n   * Emergent (broad class of neurally-plausible connectionist models);\n   * ACT-R (symbolic, production system models).\n\nThe goal is to encourage users to think about information processing in a \"mind/brain-like\" way, while imposing as few\nconstraints as possible on what it is possible to implement or ask the model to do.\n\n.. _What_PsyNeuLink_is_NOT:\n\nWhat PsyNeuLink is **NOT**\n--------------------------\n\nPsyNeuLink is well suited to the creation of simple to moderately complex models, and to the integration of\ndisparate existing models into a single, integrated system in which interactions among them can be examined.\nWhile it is fully general, and can be used to implement virtually any kind of model, it is less well suited to other\nkinds of efforts, that involve massively large computations and/or specialized functions and data types that it\ncurrently does not support, such as:\n\n - extensive model fitting\n - large scale simulations\n - biophysically-realistic models of individual neurons\n\nOther packages that are better suited to such applications are:\n`Emergent <https://grey.colorado.edu/emergent/index.php/Main_Page>`_ and\n`TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org>`_ (for neural network models);\n`HDDM <http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs/>`_ (for Drift Diffusion Models);\n`ACT-R <http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu>`_ (for production system models);\n`Genesis <http://www.genesis-sim.org>`_,\n`Neuron <https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/>`_,\nand `Nengo <http://www.nengo.ca>`_  (for biophysically-realistic models of neuronal function).\nThese packages are good for elaborate and detailed models of a particular form.\nIn contrast, the focus in designing and implementing PsyNeuLink has been to make it as flexible and easy to use as\npossible, with the ability to integrate components constructed in other packages (including some of the ones listed\nabove) into a single functioning system.  These are characteristics that are often (at least in the initial\nstages of development) in tension with efficiency (think:  interpreted vs. compiled).  One of the goals for future\ndevelopment is to make PsyNeuLink more computationally efficient.  At present, however, it is best suited to\ndeveloping simpler models, or taking complex or highly detailed models that have been developed --\nor subjected to extensive parameter fitting -- in other frameworks, and re-expressing them in a form that is amenable\nto integration, documentation, and dissemination.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nPsyNeuLink is compatible with python versions >= 3.5, and is available through `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PsyNeuLink>`__:\n\n::\n\n    pip install psyneulink\n\nAll prerequisite packages will be automatically added to your environment.\n\nIf you downloaded the source code, navigate to the cloned directory in a terminal,\nswitch to your preferred python3 environment, then run\n\n::\n\n    pip install .\n\nLists of required packages for PsyNeuLink, developing PsyNeuLink, and running the PsyNeuLink tutorial are also\nstored in pip-style `requirements.txt`, `dev_requirements.txt`, and `tutorial_requirements.txt` in the source code.\n\nIf you have trouble installing the package, or run into other problems, please contact psyneulinkhelp@princeton.edu.\n\n.. _Tutorial:\n\nTutorial\n--------\n\nPsyNeuLink includes a `tutorial <https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PsyNeuLink/#tutorial>`__, that provides examples of how to create basic Components\nin PsyNeuLink, and combine them into Processes and a System.  The examples include construction of a simple\ndecision making process using a Drift Diffusion Model, a neural network model of the Stroop effect, and a\nbackpropagation network for learning the XOR problem.\n\nThe tutorial currently requires python 3.5, and additional packages; to install the required tutorial packages, you may use PyPI:\n\n::\n\n    pip install psyneulink[tutorial]\n\nor if you downloaded the source:\n\n::\n\n    pip install .[tutorial]\n\n\nTo access the tutorial, make sure your environment fulfills the requirements\nmentioned above, download the `tutorial notebook <https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/PsyNeuLink/raw/master/PsyNeuLink%20Tutorial.ipynb>`__, (you may need to right click the link and select \"Save Link As...\") then run the terminal command\n\n::\n\n    jupyter notebook\n\n\nOnce the notebook opens in your browser, navigate to the location where you saved the tutorial notebook, and\nclick on \"PsyNeuLink Tutorial.ipynb\".\n\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n* **Allie Burton**, Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University\n* **Jonathan D.
