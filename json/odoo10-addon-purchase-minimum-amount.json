Users in group 'Purchase / Managers' are by default\n  assigned to this group.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nSet the Purchase Approval Block\n-------------------------------\n\n#. Go to 'Purchases / Purchase / Requests for Quotation'\n#. Create a new RFQ and upon saving if the Untaxed Amount is below the\n   Purchase Minimum Amount specified in that vendor, then the Approval Block\n   Reason is automatically set and the Approval Block Reason is not editable\n   anymore.\n\nSearch existing RFQ\n-------------------\n\nThere is a filter 'Blocked' to search for orders that are blocked.\nIt is also possible to search RFQ\u2019s with the Approval Block Reason 'Minimum\nPurchase Order Amount per Vendor'.\n\nConfirm the RFQ\n---------------\n\n#. Press the button \u2018Confirm\u2019. If there\u2019s an approval block, the order will\n   be set to status 'To Approve'. You will then need to request a Purchase\n   Manager to approve it.\n\nRelease the purchase approval block\n-----------------------------------\n\n#. All the RFQ\u2019s with a total amount surpassing the specified Minimum Purchase\n   Order Amount for that vendor (excluding taxes) are automatically released.\n#. If a blocked RFQ without surpassing the minimum amount wants to be\n   released, a user member of the security group 'Release RFQ with approval\n   block' can see a button 'Release Approval Block'. When pressing it, anyone\n   seeing that RFQ is able to validate it.\n\nNotifications to followers\n--------------------------\n\n#. Followers of the RFQ receive notifications when an approval block has been\n   set or released.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/142/10.0\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/purchase-workflow/issues>`_.
