In this particular case, the server is passive: the only thing it does is answer the clients in a 1-to-1 communication.\nIf there is no client, the server does nothing. If there is no server, the client returns an error.\n\nNow let's imagine the reverse case where one would like to broadcast a same message to N listeners, where N is subject to changing, whether some of the listening services are launched or not. This is a typical case where one would like a client to talk to many listening servers... and where the listening-servers did the \"connection step\" towards the broadcasting client... and the client is broadcasting its message even if no server is actually listening.\n\nWell, my friend, you are stuck.\n\nActually not, because this is exactly what hein does: 1-Publisher to N-Subscriber socket communication.\n\nExample\n=======\n\nStraight to the point: launch 3 terminals in which you should start an interactive python interpreter.\n\nIn the first terminal (listener 1), type:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from hein import SocReceiver\n    r = SocReceiver(port=50007, name=\"Captain\")\n    \nin the second one (transmitter), type:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from hein import SocTransmitter\n    t = SocTransmitter(port=50007, nreceivermax=2)\n    \nYou will instantly see the transmitter terminal wishing a hearful welcome to its first listener.\n\nIn in the third one (listener 2), type:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from hein import SocReceiver\n    r = SocReceiver(port=50007, name=\"Kirk\")\n    \nHere again, the transmitter terminal acknoledges the connection of the second listener. Now type in the transmitter terminal:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    t.tell_raw('hello!')\n    \nAnd you will see the message appear in both listening terminals.\n\nNow close one listener and type:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n    \n    t.ping()\n\nOnly one listener is listed with the True (is connected) flag. Now let's try another one that keeps the type of the inputs:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from datetime import datetime\n    import pytz\n    \n    t.tell_dict_type(string='hello', integer=34, float=13.4, d=datetime(2017, 12, 3, tzinfo=pytz.UTC))\n\nThe receiver will get:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    {'integer': 34, 'float': 13.4, 'string': 'hello', 'd': datetime.datetime(2017, 12, 3, 0, 0, tzinfo=<UTC>)}\n\nThis in no magic, this is smart socket communication.\n\nObviously, the behavior at connection and reception is driven my callback functions, which by default only print the listener's names or the message transmitted.\nAll you will need now is write your own functions to replace these default callbacks.\nThat's it.\n\nNote that, as you probably have seen when running the example/teaser, that the communication are natively non-blocking and asynchronous: no need to do the ennoying threading work yourself, hein is turnkey solution.\n\nThe best typical example of the use of hein is having several applications talking to each other: they are all busy doing their own things but still get messages from each other at the time their are sent (not at the time they are not busy anymore to process them).\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nRefer to this page for detailed API documentation, http://pythonhosted.org/hein/hein.html\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nHein requires the following Python packages:\n\n* socket: Obviously\n* threading, select: for threading and port-reading\n* time, os: for basic stuff\n* byt: to handle chains of bytes identically no matter the python version\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nThe easiest and fastest way for you to get the package and run is to install hein through pip::\n\n  $ pip install hein\n\nYou can also download Hein source from GitHub and type::\n\n  $ python setup.py install\n\nDependency on byt will be installed automatically. Refer to the requirements section. If you have a standard install of python (or any fancier distribution like anaconda), you should be good to go.\n\nContributing\n============\n\nCode writing\n------------\n\nCode contributions are welcome! Just send a pull request on GitHub and we will discuss it. In the `issue tracker`_ you may find pending tasks.\n\nBug reporting\n-------------\n\nIf you think you've found one please refer to the `issue tracker`_ on GitHub.\n\n.. _`issue tracker`: https://github.com/ceyzeriat/hein/issues\n\nAdditional options\n------------------\n\nYou can either send me an e-mail or add it to the issues/wishes list on GitHub.\n\nCiting\n======\n\nIf you use Hein on your project, please\n`drop me a line <mailto:{my first name}.{my family name}@gmail.com>`, you will get fixes and additional options earlier.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nHein is released under the GNU General Public License v3 or later (GPLv3+). Please refer to the LICENSE file.\n\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\nTODO:\n- tell_json method (issue with bytes)\n\n\n0.1.9 (2017-11-12)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Added tell_list_type and tell_dict_type which keep the type of the data over transmission (works for int, float, bool, None, Byt, datetime.datetime, datetime.data, datetime.time, str, unicode (Pyt2), and bytes (Pyt3))\n- Modified 'tell' methods to accept unicode characters. Python3 built-in 'str' and Pyhton2 built-in 'unicode' are encoded as \"utf-8\", Python2 built-in 'str' and Python2/3 'bytes' are encoded as \"ascii\" (i.e. \"latin-1\").\n\n\n0.1.8 (2017-10-28)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Added tell_list\n- Fixed infinite connection looping when adding two socrecievers with same name\n\n\n0.1.7 (2017-04-04)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Implemented connect parameter in SocReceiver\n- Fixed bug on key being compared to instance Byt\n- Fixed bug with 'key' keyword in tell_key\n\n\n0.1.4 (2017-04-03)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Added hostname to SocReceiver\n- Added tell_key method to SocTransmitter to send any key-type of dictionary\n\n\n0.1.2 (2017-03-22)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Made timeout parameter of acknowledgement of receipt accessible\n\n\n0.1.1 (2017-03-09)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Improved high-frequency management of communications\n- Changed maximum communication frequency to 100 Hz; faster communications are merged\n\n\n0.1.0 (2017-03-05)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Initial release",
