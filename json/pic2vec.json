    "description": "Pic2Vec\n================\n\nFeaturize images using a small, contained pre-trained deep learning network\n\n\n* Free software: BSD license\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nThis is the prototype for image features engineering.  Currently, only\nPython 2.7 is supported.\n\n``pic2vec`` is a python package that performs automated feature extraction\nfor image data. It supports training models via the\nDataRobot modeling API, as well as feature engineering on new image data.\n\n## Input Specification\n\n### Data Format\n\n``pic2vec`` works on image data represented as either:\n1. A directory of image files.\n2. As URL pointers contained in a CSV.\n3. Or as a directory of images with a CSV containing pointers to the image files.\n\nIf no CSV is provided with the directory, it automatically generates a CSV to store the features with the appropriate images.\n\nEach row of the CSV represents a different image, and image rows can also have columns containing other data about the images as well. Each image's featurized representation will be appended as a series of new columns at the end of the appropriate image row.\n\n\n### Constraints Specification\nThe goal of this project was to make the featurizer as easy to use and hard to break as possible. If working properly, it should be resistant to badly-formatted data, such as missing rows or columns in the csv, image mismatches between a CSV and an image directory, and invalid image formats.\n\nHowever, for the featurizer to function optimally, it prefers certain constraints:\n* The CSV should have no missing columns or rows, and there should be full overlap between images in the CSV and the image directory\n\n* If checking predictions on a separate test set (such as on Kaggle), the filesystem needs to sort filepaths consistently with the sorting of the test set labels. The order in the CSV (whether generated automatically or passed in) will be considered the canonical order for the feature vectors.\n\nThe featurizer can only process .png, .jpeg, or .bmp image files. Any other images will be left out of the featurization by being represented by zero vectors in the image batch.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nThe following Python code shows a typical usage of `pic2vec`:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pic2vec import ImageFeaturizer\n\nimage_column_name = 'images'\nmy_csv = 'path/to/data.csv'\nmy_image_directory = 'path/to/image/directory/'\n\nmy_featurizer = ImageFeaturizer(depth=2)\n\nmy_featurizer.load_data(image_column_name, csv_path = my_csv, image_path = my_image_directory)\n\nmy_featurizer.featurize()\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nTo get started, see the following example:\n\n1. [Cats vs. Dogs](examples/cats_v_dogs.ipynb): Dataset from combined directory + CSV\n\nExamples coming soon:\n1. [Hotdogs](examples/hotdogs): Dataset from unsupervised directory only, with PCA visualization\n1. [URLs](examples/): Dataset from CSV with URLs and no image directory\n\n\n## Installation\n\nSee the [Installation Guide](docs/guides/installation.md) for details.\n\n### Installing Keras/Tensorflow\nIf you run into trouble installing Keras or Tensorflow as a dependency, read the [Keras installation guide](https://keras.io/#installation) and  [Tensorflow installation guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) for details about installing Keras/Tensorflow on your machine.\n\n\n## Using Featurizer Output With DataRobot\n``pic2vec`` generates a CSV that is ready to be dropped directly into the DataRobot application, if the data has been labelled with a variable that can be considered a target in the CSV. The image features are each treated like regular columns containing data.\n\n\n### Running tests\n\nTo run the unit tests with ``pytest``, run\n\n```\npy.test tests\n```\n\n\n\nCredits\n---------\n\nThis package was created with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) and the [audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage) project template.\n\n\n=======\nHistory\n=======\n\n0.1.0 (2017-06-14)\n------------------\n\n* First release on PyPI.\n\n0.2.0 (2017-06-22)\n------------------\n\n* Second release on PyPI.\n* Install keras with tensorflow backend specifically\n\n0.2.1 (2017-06-22)\n------------------\n\n* Bug fixes\n\n0.2.2(2017-06-22)\n------------------\n\n* Full requirements for keras imported\n\n0.2.3(2017-06-22)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed build_featurizer troubles with building new csv paths in current directory\n\n0.2.4(2017-06-22)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed more bugs in build_featurizer\n\n0.2.5(2017-06-23)\n------------------\n* 100% test coverage\n* Fixed a problem where a combined directory + csv was appending to the wrong\n  rows when there was a mismatch between the directory and the csv.\n\n 0.2.6(2017-06-23)\n ------------------\n* Added features-only csv test, and got rid of the column headers in the file\n* Added Documentation to data featurization modeules\n\n0.2.7(2017-06-23)\n------------------\n* Changed image_directory_path to the more manageable image_path\n* Made testing module and preprocessing module slightly more robust.\n\n\n0.2.8(2017-06-23)\n------------------\n* Fixed variable name bugs\n\n\n0.2.9(2017-06-23)\n------------------\n* Fixed import problem that prevented generated csvs from saving\n\n0.3.0 (2017-06-23)\n------------------\n* Created installation instructions and readme files, ready for prototype distribution\n\n0.4.0 (2017-06-23)\n------------------\n* Added ability to call multiple models, and packaged in SqueezeNet with weights.\n\n0.4.1 (2017-06-23)\n------------------\n* Fixed documentation\n\n0.4.2 (2017-06-23)\n------------------\n* Improved README test examples\n\n0.4.3 (2017-06-23)\n------------------\n* Second round of code review- optimized code, better type checking with trafaret\n\n0.5.0 (2017-07-6)\n------------------\n* Renamed to pic2vec\n* Tests parametrized\n\n\n",
