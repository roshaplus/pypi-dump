    "description": "Weboob is a project which provides a core library, modules and applications.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nThe core library defines capabilities: features common to various websites.\nFor example, http://www.youtube.com/ and http://www.dailymotion.com/ both\nprovide videos; Weboob defines the \"CapVideo\" capability for them.\n\nEach module interfaces with a website and implements one or many of these\ncapabilities. Modules can be configured (becoming a \"backend\"), which means\nthat the end-user can provide personal information to access the underlying\nwebsite, like a login and password.\n\nApplications allow the end-user to work with many modules in parallel,\nin a multi-threaded way. For example, one could search a video on\nmany websites at once. Applications are toolkit-agnostic. They can use GTK+,\nQt or be text-only. The latter can be used either in an interactive way\nor in pipes.\n\nThe core library provides base classes which help developers write\nmodules and applications.\n\nWeboob is written in Python and is distributed under the AGPLv3+ license.\n\n\nFor more information, please go to the official website at http://weboob.org/\n\nInstallation is described on the website or in the INSTALL file.\n\n\n",
