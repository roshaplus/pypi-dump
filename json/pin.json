    "description": "pin\n======\n\n**pin** is a plugin-based command-line utility that helps you manage your software development projects. At it's core, it is a registry of where your projects reside on your file-system. Registering your project with **pin** lets you use utilize the various plugins. Since **pin** is generic, what this means exactly is based on what your project is and what plugins you have installed. \n\n### Installation \n\n    $ sudo pip install pin\n\n### Usage\n\nTo use **pin** you will need to source it's shell-script which is installed under the name **pin.sh**:\n\n    $ source pin.sh\n\nThe **pin** command will now be available to you. To see the core pin commands you can use the **help** command:\n\n    $ pin help\n    usage: pin [-v]\n    \n    optional arguments:\n      -v, --version  show program's version number and exit\n    \n    Available commands for /home/dlacewell/dev/mine/pin:\n    destroy  - Destroy and unregister the project from pin.\n         go  - Teleport to a specific project.\n       help  - This help information. \n       init  - Initialize pin in the current directory.\n    $ \n\nLets try out **pin init** in a new directory:\n\n    $ mkdir /tmp/testing\n    $ cd /tmp/testing\n    $ pin init\n    Creating .pin directory structure...\n    pin project initialized in: /tmp/testing\n    $\n\n**pin** has created a project directory located at */tmp/testing/.pin/* **Generally, commands that operate upon your project can be used *anywhere* below the project's root directory**. **pin** doesn't do much on it's own but plugins can add new functionality to existing commands or new commands all together. Let's go ahead and install the *pin-venv* plugins to give **pin** the ability to work with *VirtualEnv*.\n\n    $ sudo pip install pinvenv\n    ...\n    $ rm -fdr .pin/\n    $ pin init --venv\n    Creating .pin directory structure...\n    Creating virtualenv...\n    pin project initialized in: /tmp/testing\n    $ ls .pin/env\n    bin include lib\n    $\n\n### Core Commands\n\n**pin init** : Initializes the .pin directory and registers the path with ~/.pinconf/registry.yml\n\n**pin destroy** : Deletes the project's .pin directory and unregisters the project path. Only works from inside a project tree.\n\n**pin go <project-name>** : Teleports to the project root if a name is provided. If no name is provided a menu will be presented.\n\n**pin help** : Lists all pin commands including any provided by installed plugins.\n\n### Plugins\n\nPlugins to extend pin's core functionality can be found at the [Pin Cushion](https://github.com/dustinlacewell/pin/wiki/Pin-Cushion)\n\n\n### Writing Plugins\n\nPlugins for **pin** are packaged as Namespace packages. Ensure that your plugin package resembles the following structure:\n\n    yourpackage/\n      setup.py\n      requirements.tx\n      README\n      pin/\n        __init__.py\n        plugins/\n          __init__.py\n          yourpackage.py\n\nTo make your package namespaced you will need to add the following lines to each of the two **__init__.py** files:\n\n    import pkg_resources\n    pkg_resources.declare_namespace(__name__)\n\nThe two plugin-classes that you can register with pip are **commands** and **hooks**. Before covering those specifically, let's review some notable API available for plugins to use:\n\n### Utility API\n\n * **util.path_has_project(path)** : Determine if the supplied path contains the pin project-directory.\n\n * **util.get_project_root(path)** : Find the root project directory for the path, if there is one.\n\n * **util.get_settings_filename()** : Get the absolute path to the pin settings YAML file\n\n * **util.get_registry_filename()** : Get the absolute path to the pin registry YAML file\n\n\n### Writing Commands\n\nThe base command class is **command.Pincommand**. Your command will be a subclass that you register with **command.register(cls)**. There are a number of methods that you can override to define the behavior of your command. At minimum your class needs to define a class-attribute '**command**' which is the name of your command. Let's write a simple command called '*check*' the determines if the current-working-directory is inside of a pin project:\n\n    class CheckCommand(command.PinCommand):\n        command = 'check'\n\nJust to illustrate the proper way to handle arguments",
