    "description": "grapheme\n========\n\nA Python package for working with user perceived characters. More specifically,\nstring manipulation and calculation functions for workong with grapheme cluster\ngroups (graphemes) as defined by the `Unicode Standard Annex #29 <http://unicode.org/reports/tr29/>`__.\n\nWhat? Why?\n=========\n\nUnicode strings are made up of a series of unicode characters, but a unicode character does not\nalways map to a user perceived character. Some human perceived characters are represented as two\nor more unicode characters.\n\nHowever, all built in python string functions and string methods work with single unicode characters\nwithout considering their connection to each other.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> string = 'u\u0332n\u0332d\u0332e\u0332r\u0332l\u0332i\u0332n\u0332e\u0332d\u0332'\n    >>> len(string)\n    20\n    >>> grapheme.length(string)\n    10\n    >>> string[:3]\n    'u\u0332n'\n    >>> grapheme.substr(string, 0, 3)\n    'u\u0332n\u0332d\u0332'\n\nThis library implements the unicode default rules for extended grapheme clusters, and provides\na set of functions for string manipulation based on graphemes.\n\nDocumentation\n====\n\ntodo: add docs\n\nWhen should I consider graphemes instead of unicode characters?\n====\n\nYou should consider working with graphemes over unicode code points when:\n\n* You wish to count characters as perceived by users.\n* You wish to split or truncate text at some user perceived lengths.\n* You wish to split or truncate text without risk of corrupting the characters.\n* Formatting text by length, such as creating text based tables in monospaced fonts\n\nYou should work with normal python string functions when:\n\n* You wish to count or split by unicode codepoints for compliance with storage\n  limitations (such as database maximum length)\n* When working with systems that put limits on strings by unicode character\n  lengths\n* You absolutely require the performance benefits of using the built ins\n* If simplicity is more important than accuracy\n\nPerformance\n====\n\ntodo: make some benchmarks and work with performance fixes.\n\nExamples of grapheme cluster groups\n====\n\nThis is not a completet list, but a some examples of when graphemes use multiple\ncharacters:\n\n* CR+LF\n* Hangul (korean)\n* Emoji with modifiers\n* Combining marks\n* Zero Width Join\n\nDevelopment quick start\n-------------------------\n\nIf you wish to contribute or edit this package, create a fork and clone it.\n\nThen install in locally editable (``-e``) mode and run the tests.\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    pip install -e .[test]\n    py.test\n",
