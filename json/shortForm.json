    "description": "It is a hack that ties into the display system. When you are working with a\nmulti-megabyte text file, referenced under the name `txt`, which takes 10\nminutes to be printed in full (if you accidentally type '>>> txt') it's\nreally nice to have this.\n\nBesides actually turning it off, it can be evaded by using `print` or\neven sys.stdout.write itself.\nShortForm is only used when an object is repr'ed and printed.",
