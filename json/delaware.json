    "description": "Get Deleware company registration data!\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nIt might be nice if it were easy to get data about company registrations.\nMuch information is available through the\n`General Information Name Search <https://delecorp.delaware.gov/tin/GINameSearch.jsp>`_\nsite, and the present program queries this website for information.\n\nInstalling the worker\n=========================\nThe present program is separated into *worker*, *manager*, and *reader*\ncomponents. This is done so that many different workers can be run at once,\ncoordinated by a single manager.\n\nYou probably just need to install the worker and run it; by default, it will\nreceive its directions from a manager running on one of Tom's computers.\nIt will periodically contact the manager for directions, and it will query\nDelaware's General Information Name Search accordingly.\n\nTwo ways of installing are explained below.\n\nStandalone installation\n    For most people\nInstalling with Pip\n    For people who know what Python and Pip and terminals are\n\nStandalone installation\n--------------------------\nI am going to make a package with `PyInstaller <http://www.pyinstaller.org/>`_\nand put directions here as to how to install it. So this installation method\nisn't available yet.\n\nInstalling with Pip\n---------------------\nIf you are used to using a terminal and already have Python and Pip installed,\nyou can just run this command. ::\n\n    pip install delaware\n\nIf that gives you an error about permissions, try this command. ::\n\n    sudo pip install delaware\n\nRunning\n=======================\nOnce you've installed the program, type this into a terminal. ::\n\n    delaware\n\nIt'll ask you a few questions the first time you run it, but you can totally\nignore it after that.\n\nHow it works\n=================\nWhen you run ``delaware``, you are running the *worker* program. Tom is\nrunning the *manager* program. When it starts, your worker contacts Tom's\nmanager for directions.\n\nWhy would I make such a complicated program?\n\nI've told that some people much difficulty in acquiring the data, and I\nmade the present program to deal with the most annoying of difficulties.\nThe difficulty is, supposedly, that the website only allows a single IP\naddress to make so many requests. One person told me that the limit was\na few hundred requests per IP address, and another person told me that\nthe limit was 3000 requests.\n\nHaving used the site myself, I don't think that such a limit exists;\nI haven't managed to hit any of these limits myself, and the Delaware\nDivision of Corporations told me that there is no limit. So maybe this\ncomplicated thing wasn't necessary, but I already wrote it.\n\nBut in case there is a limit, the idea is that we can get a bunch of\ndifferent people each to download a small piece of the data, staying\nwithin the limits for each IP address.\n\nIf errors come up\n========================\nIf the program stops running, please send the error message to\n_@thomaslevine.com. Also, please don't delete the ``~/.delaware`` directory,\nas it contains files that can be helpful for figuring out what went wrong.\n",
