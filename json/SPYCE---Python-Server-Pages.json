    "description": "SPYCE is a server-side language that supports simple and efficient Python-based dynamic HTML generation. Those who like Python and are familiar with JSP, or PHP, or ASP, should have a look at Spyce. Its modular design makes it very flexible and extensible. It can also be used as a command-line utility for static text pre-processing.",
