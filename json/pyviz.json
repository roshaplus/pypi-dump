    "description": "**This package is currently under development and not yet ready for download from PyPI**\n\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/pyviz/pyviz.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/pyviz/pyviz\n\n.. image:: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/7xhtku2yjux40hwq/branch/master?svg=true\n    :target: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/pyviz/pyviz/branch/master\n\n\t     \n=====================================================\nHow to solve visualization problems with Python tools\n=====================================================\n\nThis repository provides examples, demos, and training materials\ndocumenting how to solve visualization problems using web-based Python\ntools supported by `Anaconda <http://anaconda.com>`_, including\n`Bokeh <http://bokeh.pydata.org>`_,\n`HoloViews <http://holoviews.org>`_,\n`GeoViews <http://geo.holoviews.org>`_,\n`Datashader <https://github.com/bokeh/datashader>`_, and\n`Param <https://github.com/ioam/param>`_.\n\nIt includes a shared conda environment that ensures all these tools work together,\nfacilities for downloading sample data for use with these tools, and provides\nstarting points for solving your own visualization problems.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nStep 1: Clone the `pyviz <https://github.com/pyviz/pyviz/blob/master/README.rst>`_ repository\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Any Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows computer with a web browser should work.  We recommend Chrome, but other browsers should also work.\n- 16GB of RAM is required for some of the examples, but most will run fine in 4GB.\n- Clone this repository, e.g. using ``git clone https://github.com/pyviz/pyviz.git``\n- Open a terminal window inside your clone of the repository.\n\nStep 2: Create a conda environment from ``environment.yml``\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you don't already have it, install `conda\n<https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_, and then create the\n``pyviz`` environment by executing::\n\n   > conda env create --force -f environment.yml\n\nWhen installation is complete you may activate the environment by writing::\n\n   > activate pyviz\n\n(for Windows) or::\n\n   $ source activate pyviz\n\n(for Linux and Mac). \n\nLater, when you are ready to exit the environment after the tutorial, you can type::\n\n   > deactivate\n\nIf for some reason you want to remove the environment entirely, you can do so by writing::\n\n   > conda env remove --name pyviz\n\n\nStep 3: Downloading the sample data\n-----------------------------------\n\nIn this tutorial we will be showing you how to work with some fairly\nlarge datasets.  Unfortunately, that also means that you have to\ndownload this data. To make this as easy as possible we have provided\na script that will download the data for you.  Simply execute in the\nroot of your clone of this repository::\n\n  > python download_sample_data.py\n\n\nStep 4: Launch Jupyter Notebook\n-------------------------------\n\nYou can then launch the notebook server and client::\n\n   (pyviz)> jupyter notebook\n\nA browser window with a Jupyter Notebook instance should now open,\nletting you select and execute each notebook.  You can start with the\nones in the \"notebooks\" subdirectory, as these show how to use the\nothers in the \"exercises\" directory along with the applications in the\n\"apps\" directory.\n\nIf you don't see the notebook appear (e.g. on some OS X versions),\nyou'll need to cut and paste the URL from the console output manually.\n\n\nStep 5: Test that everything is working\n---------------------------------------\n\nYou can see if everything has installed correctly by selecting the\n``00-welcome.ipynb`` notebook and doing \"Cell/Run All\" in the menus.\nThere may be warnings on some platforms, but you'll know it is working\nif you see the HoloViews logo after it runs ``hv.extension()``.\n\n",
