    "description": "psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language. It\r\nwas written from scratch with the aim of being very small and fast, and stable\r\nas a rock. The main advantages of psycopg are that it supports the full Python\r\nDBAPI-2.0, being thread safe at level 2 and providing some very usefull\r\nextensions like the user-defined type casters.\r\n\r\npsycopg is different from the other database adapter because it was designed for\r\nheavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy lots of cursors and\r\nmake a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or UPDATEs. Every open Python\r\nconnection keeps a pool of real (UNIX or TCP/IP) connections to the database.\r\nEvery time a new cursor is created, a new connection does not need to be opened;\r\ninstead one of the unused connections from the pool is used. That makes psycopg\r\nvery fast in typical client-server applications that create a servicing thread\r\nevery time a client request arrives.",
