    "description": "W3G: The Warcraft 3 Replay File Format\n--------------------------------------\nThis is a single module package that contains everything that is needed to \nread in the Warcraft 3 replay file format ``*.w3g``.  W3G is a custom \nbinary format.  The benefits of this are that the files are small, even for \nvery long games.  The downside is that for them to be meaningfully a lot of \nextra data needs to be provided (as is done here for you) for these files\nto be meaningfully deciphered.\n\nThe replays basically amount to a bunch of metadata (map, players, etc) and a \nbig event list.  The file parser here provides you with access to this data \nas well as some post-processed metrics, such as actions-per-minute (APM).  \n\nThe API should be easy to use and figure out. Classes and attributes are named in a\nsane way. Here is an example of usage::\n\n    import w3g\n    f = w3g.File('replay.w3g')\n\n    winner = f.winner()\n    print(winner)\n\n    f.print_apm()\n\nYou can also use this file in script mode to print out the entire game and \nits stats::\n\n    $ ./w3g.py  replay.w3g\n\nIf you have any questions or issues, please email me or leave an issue on the \nissue tracker.\n\n/scopzout",
