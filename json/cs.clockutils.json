    "description": "An implementation of PEP0418 with the \"Choosing the clock from a list of constraints\" get_clock() and get_clocks() functions.\n=============================================================================================================================\n\nPEP 418 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0418/) generated much discussion.\n\nMost particpants wanted a call to get a high resolution monotonic clock, which many platforms offer, and much of the discussion surrounded what guarrentees Python should offer for the clock it returned.\n\nI was of the opinion that:\n\n* the many different clocks available have varying features and that the user should be able to inspect them when handed a clock\n\n* the proposed time.monotonic() et al should be offered as default policies for convenience\n\n* however, the proposed time.monotonic() call and friends represented policy; the user calling it is handed an arbitrary clock with some guarrentees; the user has no facility to implement policy themselves. Therefore I proposed two calls: get_clock() and get_clocks() for requesting or enumerating clocks with desired features from those available on the platform.\n\nThis cs.clockutils package implements get_clock() and get_clocks() and provides example implementations of the \"policy\" calls such as monotonic().\n\nReferences:\n-----------\n\nPEP418\n  https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0418/\nMy core two posts in the discussion outlining my proposal\n  http://www.mail-archive.com/python-dev@python.org/msg66174.html\n  http://www.mail-archive.com/python-dev@python.org/msg66179.html",
