Chorus Pro is the electronic invoicing plateform of the French administration. All the suppliers of the French administration can send their invoices through Chorus and it is progressively becoming an obligation for all suppliers. To know more about Chorus and the obligation to send electronic invoices to the French administration, read `the dedicated page <https://www.economie.gouv.fr/entreprises/marches-publics-facture-electronique>`_ on the website of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.\n\nChorus Pro plans to start supporting the import of Factur-X invoices in 2018; so, for the moment, you should use the module *l10n_fr_chorus_ubl* instead.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nRefer to the README of the module *l10n_fr_chorus_account*.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nIn the menu *Accounting > Customers > Customer Invoices*, create an invoice for the French Administration. Validate the invoice. Then click on the *Print* button to get the Factur-X PDF invoice.\n\nThen log into `Chorus Pro <https://chorus-pro.gouv.fr/>`_. Go to the menu *Factures \u00e9mises > D\u00e9p\u00f4t factures* or, in the welcome screen *Accueil connect\u00e9*, in the section *Acc\u00e8s Rapide*, click on the button *D\u00e9poser une facture*. Then, in the pop-up, select:\n\n1. *Format de d\u00e9p\u00f4t*: *TO UPDATE WHEN AVAILABLE*\n2. *Syntaxe*: *TO UPDATE WHEN AVAILABLE*\n3. *Structure*: should display the name of your company.\n4. *Choix du fichier \u00e0 importer*: select the PDF invoice generated by Odoo.\n\nand click on *Continuer*.\n\nOnce the invoice has been successfully uploaded, you should find the invoice in the menu *Factures \u00e9mises > Rechercher* or in the menu *Factures \u00e9mises > Tableau de bord* and you should be able to see the status of the invoice. If there is an error in the XML syntax, you will receive an email several hours after the upload with the details of the error (in my experience, it was 14h after the upload !).\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/121/10.0\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/l10n-france/issues>`_.
