    "description": ".. contents::\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nThis product will add to Plone a new content rules, someway similar to the default \"*Send an email*\" ones.\nThe difference is that the email recipient is taken dinamically from a site content, not from a\nstatic list of values.\n\nIn this way the same rule, applied in different places in the site, can send the message to different users.\n\nHow to use\n==========\n\nThe rules can be enabled globally and locally like every one else, as default Plone feature.\nIn the rule configuration panel you need to fill a set of information:\n\n``Subject``\n    The e-mail subject. You can place inside this text some markers (see below).\n``Sender email``\n    The sender of the e-mail. You can leave this empty and automatically use the one from the\n    general mail settings.\n``Source field``\n    You must put there the name of the attribute from which you want to retrieve the recipient\n    e-mail. See next section.\n``Target element``\n    You need to select if the recipient's e-mail must be taken from:\n    \n    * the container where the rules is activated on\n    * the content who notified the event that started the rule execution\n    * the parent of that content \n    \n    See below for details.\n``Mail message``\n    The body text of the e-mail that will be sent. The text is the same for all section where\n    the rule is activated on.\n    \n    You can place inside this text some markers (see below).\n\nHow it take the email data\n--------------------------\n\nFirst of all you must choose the *Target element*.\n\nIf you choose to keep default \"*From rule's container*\" option address will be read from the section you have\nactivated the rule on.\n\n*Example*: if you activated the rule on folder ``/site/section`` and the rule will raise event when\nworking on a document ``/site/section/folder/foo`` the email address will be taken\nfrom the folder.\n\nChanging to \"*From content that triggered the event*\" will change the behavior, trying to get email data\nfrom the content that raised the event.\n\n*Example*: if you activated the rule on a folder ``/site/section`` and the rule  will raise event when\nworking on a document ``/site/section/folder/foo`` the email address will be taken\nfrom the ``foo`` document.\n\nFinally, if you choose \"*From content's parent*\", adresses will the taken from the container of the content\nthat triggered the event.\n\n*Example*: if you activated the rule on a folder ``/site/section`` and the rule  will raise event when\nworking on a document ``/site/section/folder/foo`` the email address will be taken\nfrom ``folder``.\n\nWhat it try to read\n-------------------\n\nThe rule try to get from the object:\n\n* an attribute of the given name\n* a callable method from the given name\n* an Archetypes field with given id\n* a ZMI property with given id\n\nThe rule try to read, one after one, all this data. The first match found will be the one used;\nif not one give results, no e-mail is sent at all.\n\nMessage interpolation\n---------------------\n\nMarker labels that follow can be used in the message text and subject.\n\n``${title}``\n    The title of the content that triggered the event (``foo`` title in our example)\n``${url}``\n    The URL of the content that triggered the event (``foo`` URL in our example)\n``${section_name}``\n    The title of the folder where the rule is activated on (``section`` title in our example)\n``${section_url}``\n    The URL of the folder where the rule is activated on (``section`` URL in our example)\n\nA real Plone use case\n---------------------\n\nA Plone site use `Signup Sheet`__ for manage internal training session. The form fieldset is\ncustomized as normal, but one of the field is ``director_email``.\n\n__ http://plone.org/products/signupsheet\n\nWe want that this e-mail address is notified when a user subscribe and the user\nitself put there the e-mail address of the proper director.\n\nTo reach this we need to:\n\n* create a new rule triggered on \"*Object added to this container*\"\n* add a filter condition based on content type *Registrant*\n* add an action using the \"*Send email to address taken from the content*\"\n* specify in the action the SignupSheet field with the director email\n* specify in the action that we want to take the email from the target content\n  (the Registrant itself)\n\nTODO\n====\n\n* why don't support also looking in annotations?\n* right now the rules check all mail source until one is found with a defined order;\n  maybe is better to leave this choice to the configuration\n* Dexterity support (probably already there, but needs to be tested)\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nThis product has been tested on:\n\n* Plone 4.2\n* Plone 4.3\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nDeveloped with the support of `S. Anna Hospital, Ferrara`__; S.
