When run, it will pop up a window\nasking for a response to a query, and then it will execute a command based\non the response.  Currently supported queries are:\n\"ssh\" - asks what host you would like to ssh to, opens up new terminal with\n        ssh connection\n\"man\" - asks what man page you would like to display, opens up new terminal\n        with that man page\n\"run\" - asks what command you would like to run",
