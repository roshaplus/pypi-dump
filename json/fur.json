    "description": "fur\n===\n\nack is great but doesn't replace. Scratch my itch: fur - a command line \nutility for searching and replacing in text files. \n\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nfur was born more or less out of the lack of a good search and replace \nfunctionality in vim that worked not just against open buffers,\nbut across an entire file system directory.\n\nAck provided the basic model for searching as well as dislaying results\n(though my knowlege and usage of ack has been fairly limited). \n\nRather than just dump a listing of all the search results, I also wanted \nsomething that first displayed a summary of the number of results  with \nthe option of cancelling the call without displaying (who wants to skim \nthrough hundreds of results as the default).\n\nFor replacing I wanted 2 options:\n\n    - the ability to view the search results with the given substitution\n      prior to actually running the replacement.\n\n    - the ability to select which replacements to apply (i.e. replace all,\n      replace some, replace none)\n\n\nCurrent Status\n--------------\n\nThis is pre-alpha software. \n\nIt's currently being used daily by the author, but is in no way production \nready software.  \n\nThe command line options and api are in flux, there is no documentation and \nunit testing is, um, well, there are none.\n\nThat said, any suggestions and/or requests are welcome.",
