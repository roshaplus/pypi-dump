    "description": "# sorl-watermark\n\nAs of 12th July 2013, *vbazhin* will be taking over development and take care of implementing all the\nmentioned features. Everybody welcome him with a warm applause :D!\n\nsorl-watermark offers drop-in engines for sorl-thumbnail, which automagically\ninsert a specified image as watermark on top of the original thumbnail. \n\nOf course everything is configurable, from watermark image to the position and\nthe opacity.\n\nIf you are looking for a sorl engine to dynamically create text watermarks,\nyou might want to have a look at [zeus/watermark](https://bitbucket.org/zeus/watermarker/overview).\n\n_Note_: This project uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) as it's\n        versioning scheme.\n\n## Setup\nInstall sorl-watermark, either by cloning from the [github repository]() or\nby installing it via `pip`:\n\n    pip install sorl_watermarker\n\nChange sorl's thumbnail engine to the fitting one from sorl-watermark.\nBy now PIL and pgmagick engines are implemented.\n\nPIL:\n\n    THUMBNAIL_ENGINE = 'sorl_watermarker.engines.pil_engine.Engine'\n\nPgmagick:\n\n    THUMBNAIL_ENGINE = 'sorl_watermarker.engines.pgmagick_engine.Engine'\n\n\nNext up you tell it which image should be used as a watermark. Note that this\nfile has to live somewhere inside STATIC\\_ROOT.\n\n    THUMBNAIL_WATERMARK = 'my_watermark.png'\n\nThat's it for a simple setup. The engine will only apply the watermark\nif the thumbnail size is big enough. \n\nSee _Advanced Usage_ for ways to dynamically change the watermark itself,\nit's size or ways to selectively apply watermarks.\n\n## Engines\nsorl-watermark supports two of sorl-thumbnails backends:\n\n* PIL (sorl_watermarker.engines.pil)\n* GraphicsMagick (Magick++) via pgmagick (sorl_watermarker.engines.magick)\n\n## Advanced Usage\nsorl-watermark also _enhances_ the default `thumbnail` templatetag with some\nmore options. (Well, actually it does not really enhance it, since the templatetag\nitself passes the options through to the engine itself by default)\n\nBy default, the templatetag syntax is:\n\n    {% thumbnail image key1=var1 key2=var2 %}\n\nThe following new options are available:\n\n* `watermark=imagefile`  \n  This options takes an ImageFile and uses this one instead of the default\n  watermark file, set via `THUMBNAIL_WATERMARK`\n* `watermark_size=\"x200\"`  \n  Changes the watermark's size. Takes the same options as the\n  `THUMBNAIL_WATERMARK_SIZE` option.\n* `watermark_pos=\"north east\"`  \n  Specifies where the watermark shall be put. Accepts the same options as the\n  `THUMBNAIL_WATERMARK_POSITION` setting.\n* `watermark_alpha=0.9`  \n  Sets the watermark's opacity. Has to be a value between 0 and 1.\n\n## Settings Reference\nThe following settings are available\n\n* `THUMBNAIL_WATERMARK`  \n  Sets the image to be used as a watermark. The file must live within \n  `STATIC_ROOT`.\n\n* `THUMBNAIL_WATERMARK_ALWAYS`  \n  Stamp a watermark on every image.  \n  Default is `True`.\n\n* `THUMBNAIL_WATERMARK_SIZE`  \n  Change the size of the watermark. This can either be a geometry string, as\n  is usual with sorl-thumbnail (\"x200\", \"200x200\"), or a percentage.  \n  If given a percentage, the watermark will always be the given percentage\n  of the thumbnail size.\n\n* `THUMBNAIL_WATERMARK_OPACITY`\n  An integer from 0 to 1, specifying the opacity of the watermark.  \n  Default is `0` (opaque).\n\n* `THUMBNAIL_WATERMARK_POSITION`  \n  Specifies the position of the watermark. You can either pass this a gravity\n  like\n\n      * \"north\"\n      * \"south\"\n      * \"west\"\n      * \"east\"\n      * \"north east\"\n      * \"south east\"\n      * \"north west\"\n      * \"south west\"\n      * \"center\"\n\n  If you want to tile your image completely with a watermark, you should set\n  \n      THUMBNAIL_WATERMARK_POSITION = 'tile'\n\n\n  or with a pair of values in pixels (\"20 20\" would place watermark near the left-top corner,\n  \"-20 -20\" - near the right-bottom corner).  \n  Default: `\"south east\"`",
