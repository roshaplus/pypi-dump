    "description": "Beacon IRC Bot\r\n==============\r\n\r\nBeacon is the successor to my previous bot, [sthrs/Pythot](https://github.com/sthrs/Pythot), in turn a fork of [sbp/phenny](https://github.com/sbp/phenny).\r\n\r\nI plan on porting modules from phenny and Pythot (it's not that difficult, just upgrade it for Python 3 and change around a few variable names).\r\n\r\nBefore you begin, the prerequisites are:\r\n\r\n   * Python 3.1+\r\n   * [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org)\r\n\r\nAfter that, edit the `conf.yaml.sample` file, move it to `conf.yaml`, and run:\r\n<pre>$ ./main.py</pre>\r\nto start the bot. Have fun!\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n=======\r\n\r\nTests are performed in the `test/` directory.  Tests can be run individually on a per-file basis, or they can all be run at once by running `__init__.py`.",
