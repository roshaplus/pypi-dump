    "description": ".. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-LGPL--3-blue.svg\n    :target: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0-standalone.html\n    :alt: License: LGPL-3\n\n======================\nDefault Product Images\n======================\n\nThis module adds default images to products with the ability to map their images to their\n`Category's Image`, to a single, `Global Product Image`, or to both, `Global and Category`, where global\nacts as a backup if the category has no image. You can also disable default images by choosing\n`No Default Image`.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThere are a few notable features in this module, see below:\n\nPost Installation\n-----------------\n\nAfter installation, all products with no image will be automatically changed\nwhen you change your company's `Product Image Target` (see Stock Configuration Page).\nSince the default option is `No Default Image`, your product images will remain untouched during installation.\n\nWhen Will Product Images Be Automatically Changed?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n* Product images will automatically change when you change `Default Product Image` in the stock configuration page.\n* Product images will also be changed if you change the product's category in the product form. This only applies\n  if the `Default Product Image` is set to `Category's Image` or `Global and Category`.\n* Lastly, product images will be automatically changed if you change the image on their category's image. Again,\n  only applicable if `Default Product Image` is set to `Category's Image` or `Global and Category`.\n\nThe above rules only apply to your current products that do not have an image. Products that already\nhave an image when installing this module will be marked as `custom` images. The images on those products will not\nchange unless you click the `Apply Default Image` in the product form view.\n\nStock Configuration Page\n------------------------\n\n* Go to `Inventory` in the top header.\n* Under `Configuration`, click `Settings`.\n* Under `Products` is a field, `Default Product Image`.\n* `No Default Image` deletes all eligible product images.\n* `Global Product Image` sets all eligible product images to the `Global Product Image` field that\n  shows up below.\n* `Category's Image` sets all eligible product images to their category's image.\n* `Global and Category` sets all eligible product images to their category's image if that category\n  has an image. Otherwise the image is set to the `Global Product Image`.\n\nEligible refers to products that have Auto Change Image as True, do not have an image, do not have\na custom image, or have a default image already.\n\nProduct Category Form View\n--------------------------\n\n* Image fields have been added to categories\n* Changing the category's image field will also change product images that are tied to that\n  category. Only applicable if `Default Product Image` is set to `Category's Image` or `Global and Category`\n\nProduct Form View\n-----------------\n\n* Go to `Inventory` in the top header.\n* Under `Inventory Control`, click `Products`.\n* Click on a product.\n* In the product form view, you'll see in the upper left hand corner a new button which says `Apply Default Image`.\n  Use this button if you want to change a custom image to a default one, or reset a default image.\n* Go to a product that has a default or no image, and you'll see a new field under the `General Information` tab\n  called `Auto Change Image`. Uncheck this field if you want the image not to change. When uploading a custom image\n  you don't have to worry about this field. However if you want to delete a product's image and keep it from\n  automatically changing, make sure to uncheck `Auto Change Image`.\n\nAll image defaults are also loaded when you create a new product.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/135/10.0\n\nKnown Issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* Refactor product.template _change_template_image method\n* Centralize logic that converts the company product_image_target to the\n  correct product image_type value (usually in the form of a to_type arg),\n  accounting for GLOBAL_CATEGORY. Repetitive logic occurs in: product.template\n  apply_default_image, product.template _onchange_categ_id,\n  product.template default_get, res.company write, and product.category write methods.\n* After logic is centralized, add a res.company create method overload that auto-populates\n  product images.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/product-attribute/issues>`_.
