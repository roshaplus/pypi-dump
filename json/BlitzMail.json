    "description": "This is an implementation of the majority of the BlitzMail protocol in\nPython.  If you are not familiar with BlitzMail, you probably do not\nneed this, however, for more information, see:\n\n  http://www.dartmouth.edu/softdev/\n  http://www.dartmouth.edu/comp/support/library/software/email/blitzmail/\n\nIn summary, BlitzMail is an easy-to-use electronic mail system\ndeveloped at Dartmouth College in the late 1980's, which is still the\ndominant e-mail system in use at the College as of this writing.  It\nis also used at other sites (e.g., Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center,\nReed College, Washington University, and at least two ISP's in the\nUpper Connecticut River Valley).",
