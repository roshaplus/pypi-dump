    "description": "gittalk\n=======\n\nImagine you are working on a hack, and you just pushed some code. \nInstead of yelling to your teammates and letting them aware of the \nchanges, wouldn't it be cool to have the computer say it out loud \nfor you?   \n\n## Installation\n\n`pip install gittalk`     \n\n`python setup.py install` should also be just fine, in case you don't \nhave Pip installed.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* `pyttsx`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyttsx\n\nThe file `requirements.txt` contains all other dependencies I've used \nwhile working on `gittalk`, though most of them are not needed in \nrunning this program.\n\nPyttsx will also install its own dependencies.\n\n## Doesn't work?\n\nMost likely, the installation for pyttsx failed. Check out \nhttps://github.com/parente/pyttsx and see if any previously raised \nissues there are helpful. Unfortunately, I've only tested this on \nUbuntu 12.10 32-bit, so it might not work as expected on Windows/OSX...   \n\n## Features and Usage\n\n* Make a git commit as usual. Then type `gittalk` on the terminal. The \nlast commit message should be said out loud. :D\n\n* ... More to come! (see `say_last_push` in `gittalk/core.py` for example)\n\n## Notes\nThis is still pretty basic, and is mostly my attempt at playing with \ndifferent TTS (text-to-speech) packages in Python, as well as learning \nhow to structure a proper Python package and share it via Pip.  \n\nThat said, I do plan to extend it further and make this even more fun \nand useful. Please send me a pull request if you would like to \ncontribute. Suggestions/criticism/advice are all welcome!",
