    "description": "Fastcharmap is about 5 times faster than Python's charmap routines.\n\nUsage:  fastcharmap.hook('codec_name')\n\nFastcharmap inserts faster code that works when unicode() or \"\".encode\nare called.  Installation requires a binary distribution or a C\ncompiler; Pyrex is required for changes to the source.  Python's\ndevelopers are working on faster charmap codecs for a future version of\nPython; fastcharmap may be useful until then.",
