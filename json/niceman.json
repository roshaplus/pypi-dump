    "description": "NICEMAN\n=======\n\nNICEMAN aims to simplify creation and management of computing\nenvironments in Neuroimaging. While concentrating on Neuroimaging\nuse-cases, it is by no means is limited to this field of science and\ntools will find utility in other fields as well.\n\nStatus\n======\n\nNICEMAN is under initial rapid development to establish core\nfunctionality. While the code base is still growing the focus is\nincreasingly shifting towards robust and safe operation with a sensible\nAPI. There has been no major public release yet, as organization and\nconfiguration are still subject of considerable reorganization and\nstandardization.\n\nSee `CONTRIBUTING.md <CONTRIBUTING.md>`__ if you are interested in\ninternals and/or contributing to the project.\n\nCode status:\n------------\n\n-  |Travis tests status| travis-ci.org (master branch)\n\n-  |codecov.io|\n\n-  |Documentation|\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nDebian-based systems\n--------------------\n\nOn Debian-based systems we recommend to enable\n`NeuroDebian <http://neuro.debian.net>`__ from which we will soon\nprovide recent releases of NICEMAN (as soon as there is something to\nrelease). We will also provide backports of all necessary packages from\nthat repository.\n\nOther Linux'es, OSX (Windows yet TODO) via pip\n----------------------------------------------\n\nBy default, installation via pip installs core functionality of niceman\nallowing for managing datasets etc. Additional installation schemes are\navailable, so you could provide enhanced installation via\n``pip install niceman[SCHEME]`` where ``SCHEME`` could be\n\n-  tests to also install dependencies used by unit-tests battery of the\n   niceman\n-  full to install all of possible dependencies.\n\nFor installation through ``pip`` you would need some external\ndependencies not shipped from it (e.g. ``docker``, ``singularity``,\netc.) for which please refer to the next section.\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nOur ``setup.py`` and corresponding packaging describes all necessary\ndependencies. On Debian-based systems we recommend to enable\n`NeuroDebian <http://neuro.debian.net>`__ since we use it to provide\nbackports of recent fixed external modules we depend upon. Additionally,\nif you would like to develop and run our tests battery see\n`CONTRIBUTING.md <CONTRIBUTING.md>`__ regarding additional dependencies.\n\nLater we will provide bundled installations of NICEMAN across popular\nplatforms.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nMIT/Expat\n\nDisclaimer\n==========\n\nIt is in a alpha stage -- **nothing** is set in stone yet and nothing is\nusable ATM -- subscribe and wait for the first release.\n\n.. |Travis tests status| image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/ReproNim/niceman.png?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/ReproNim/niceman\n.. |codecov.io| image:: https://codecov.io/github/ReproNim/niceman/coverage.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://codecov.io/github/ReproNim/niceman?branch=master\n.. |Documentation| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/NICEMAN/badge/?version=latest\n   :target: http://niceman.rtfd.org\n",
