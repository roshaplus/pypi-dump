Go to the products that you want them to trigger manufacturing orders.\n#. Go to the *Inventory* tab.\n#. Check the route *manufacture* and the box *Manufacturing Request*.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo use this module, you need to:\n\n#. Go to *Manufacturing > Manufacturing Requests*.\n#. Create a manufacturing request or open a existing one (assigned to you or\n   created from a procurement).\n#. If you click on *Request approval* button the user assigned as approver\n   will added to the thread.\n#. If you are the approver you can either click on *Approve* or *Reject*\n   buttons.\n#. Rejecting a MR will cancel associated procurements and propagate this\n   cancellation.\n#. Approving a MR will allow to create manufacturing orders.\n#. You can manually set to done a request by clicking in the button *Done*.\n\nTo create MOs from MRs you have to:\n\n#. Go to approved manufacturing request.\n#. Click on the button *Create Manufacturing Order*.\n#. In the opened wizard, click on *Compute lines* so you will have a\n   quantity proposed for creating a MO. This quantity is the maximum quantity\n   you can produce with the current stock available in the source location.\n#. Use the proposed quantity or change it and click on *Create MO* at the\n   bottom of the wizard.\n\n**NOTE:** This module does not restrict the quantity that can be converted\nfrom a MR to MOs. It is in hands of the user to decide when a MR is ended and\nto set it to *Done* state.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/129/9.0\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* Take into account workstations.\n* Take into account consumable products.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/manufacture/issues>`_.
