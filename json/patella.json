    "description": "A Webservice for Scraping Files and Plotting Data Against Presidential Party Variation\n======================================================================================\n\n``patella`` uses Flask to host an interactive html/css/js frontend through which users can navigate to\ndata and plot it.\n\n\n\n\nFlask Url Paths\n---------------\n\n``patella`` uses the  http ``GET`` and ``POST`` commands to send data between\none page and another. The homepage paths are ``/`` and ``/index`` from which you can\nnavigate to the rest of the front end.\n\n\n\nInstall and Run Directions\n--------------------------\n\n``patella`` is uploaded to the pip package repository.\n\nTo install, simply run ``pip install patella``\\ . A ``requirements.txt`` file that comes with the\npackage specifies its dependencies. Install these with ``pip install -r requirements.txt``\\ . It is\nrecommended you run this in a virtual environment so as not to interfere with previous installations.\n\nTo start the Flask server, run ``patella startup <URL>``\\ , where URL is the path\nto be prepended to the page url. Next, use a browser to browse to ``127.0.0.1:4444``\\ .\nTo access the service from other computers on the same network, use the public ip of the host\ncomputer on port 4444. From these two addresses the webservice can be accessed as long as the server is running.\n\n\nFiles\n-----\n\nLog Files\n+++++++++\nA log file will be generated in the path that you run the webservice from named\n``webservice.log``. this file includes server reloads, error reporting, logs get\nand post requests and debugger pins. ``POST`` and ``GET`` logs are timestamped, but others are not\n\n\nData Files\n++++++++++\nData files from the webservice will be downloaded to a ``data/`` directory created at runtime in the directory the\nserver is started from. In that directory, all files downloaded from the webservice will be browseable.",
