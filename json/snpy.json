    "description": "PURPOSE\n-------\n\nSNPY (or more affectionately SNooPy) is a Python package for fitting the\nlight-curves of TypeIa supernovae.  It is NOT an off-the-shelf program that\nwill do all the work for you from the command line.  It is meant to be run\ninteractively.  It provides many tools, but does not lock you into a specific\nroutine for fitting and therefore allows for a great deal of customization.\nThe package also contains a number of stand-alone sub-packages that can be\ninstalled seperately.\n\nYou can find intructions for installing snpy in the INSTALL file and at\nthe following website:\n\nhttp://csp.obs.carnegiescience.edu/data/snpy/installing_snoopy2\n\nDocumentation can be found the the docs/ directory under the source tree.  \nBut briefly, here is what SNOOPY can do:\n\n- Fit lightcurve templates to data.  These templates were constructed\n  from the Carnegie Supernova Project's low-z data set (as outlined in\n  Contreras et al. (2009) and Follatelli et al. (2010)).  These include\n  templates for the CSP uBVgriYJH filter set.  You can also use Jose-\n  Louis Prieto's templates to fit Johnson/Kron/Cousins BRVI lightcurves.\n\n- Using templates, fit for distance (and dm15, E(B-V), stretch, time of \n  maximum, etc.  This uses the calibration of Follatelli et al. (2010) \n  for the CSP filter set, or Prieto et al. (2006) for the BVRI set.\n\n- Alternatively, fit for light-curve parameters only (dm15, stretch,\n  time of maximum, maximum light, colors, etc).\n\n- Compute k-corrections based on the spectral energy distribution\n  template of Hsiao et al. (2007).  This includes color-matching the\n  SED template to the observed filters.  You can do plain K-corrections\n  or cross-band K-corrections.  This is normally done as part of the \n  fitting procedure, but can be done separately.\n\n- Fit splines, Gaussian Processes, and polynomials to light-curves to\n  do your own analysis, independent of the light-curve templates.\n\n- Built-in Lira Law to estimate E(B-V).\n\n- Various plotting routines.\n\n- Interact with a properly set-up SQL database.\n\nThe subpackages include:\n\n- filters:   a package for working with filter systems.  computing\n  zero-points, producing synthetic photometry, etc.\n\n- dm15temp:  a python wrapper to Jose-Louis Prieto's light-curve\n  generator\n\n- CSPtemp:  a generator for the CSP light-curve templates.\n\n- spline2:  a python wrapper to the Hyperspline (or spline2) algorithm,\n  which uses the Durbin-Watson statistic rather than chi-square.  Good\n  if you don't trust your error bars.\n\n- tspack:  a python wrapper to the TSPACK library:  generating tension\n  splines.'''\n\n",
