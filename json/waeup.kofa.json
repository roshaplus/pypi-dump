    "description": "What is WAeUP.Kofa ?\n********************\n\nKofa means 'entrance' or 'portal' in Hausa language.\n\nWAeUP.Kofa is a multifunctional, open source, web based student\nmanagement system to provide transparent and comprehensive\ninformation about application and study progress. The system\ncontrols all kinds of application and student registration processes\nat large schools and universities in Nigeria. It is a generic system\nwhich can be deployed by, and is useful to most universities,\ncolleges or schools worldwide.\n\nWAeUP.Kofa is the flagship of the West African eUniversity Project\n(WAeUP). See http://www.waeup.org to learn more about WAeUP.\n\nWAeUP.Kofa is really an allrounder. The best way to briefly describe\nits functionality, is to explain what the software can *not* do for\nyou, rather than trying to describe all its features in just a few\nwords. Kofa is primarily not an e-learning system, although, it has\nsome basic content management features which can be used by\nlecturers to disseminate course material. Kofa is also not a\nscheduler which generates lesson plans or timetables for lecturers\nor students. Although students register their courses with Kofa and\ncan see or print course lists for each academic session, so far,\ncourses do not contain information, when or where they take place.\nHowever, due to the modular design of Kofa, a scheduler or room\nplanner could be easily added.\n\nWAeUP.Kofa is divided into sections. Each section has its own folder\nin Kofa's `object database`. When starting Kofa in debug mode::\n\n  $ ./bin/kofactl debug\n\nwe can use simple Python expression to view the first two levels of\nthe database structure::\n\n  >>> list(root.keys())\n  [u'app']\n  >>> list(root['app'].keys())\n  [u'accesscodes', u'applicants', u'configuration', u'datacenter',\n   u'documents', u'faculties', u'hostels', u'mandates', u'reports',\n   u'students', u'users']\n\n\nThe section/folder structure can be figured as follows::\n\n  root (Database Root)\n  |\n  +---> app (University)\n        |\n        +---> faculties (Academic Section)\n        |\n        +---> students (Students Section)\n        |\n        +---> applicants (Aplicants Section)\n        |\n        +---> documents (Documents Section)\n        |\n        +---> hostels (Accommodation Section)\n        |\n        +---> accesscodes (Access Codes Section)\n        |\n        +---> configuration (Configuration Section)\n        |\n        +---> users (Officers)\n        |\n        +---> datacenter (Data Center)\n        |\n        +---> mandates (Mandates)\n        |\n        +---> reports (Reports)\n\nThe user handbook follows this organizational structure and adds\nfurther chapters where needed. Also installation instructions and\nbasic information about customization can be found there.\n\nYou can also find latest docs at https://kofa-doc.waeup.org/\n\n\nChanges\n*******\n\n1.5 (2017-02-14)\n================\n\n* Happy Valentines Day everybody!\n\n* Sort arguments in table of `ReportsContainerPage`.\n\n* Add `entry_session` and `p_session` filter to Student Payment Statistics\n  generator.

KofaAction can be used instead. Additional\n  parameters can be used in @action decorators to enable tooltips and/or\n  warning windows.
