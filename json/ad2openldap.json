    "description": "ad2openldap is a tool for replicating user/group information from a Microsoft Active Directory\nserver into an OpenLDAP server.\n\nad2openldap exists to:\n\n::\n\n    Compensate for Active Directory performance issues\n    Isolate AD servers from potential overload from bad cluster applications\n\nInitially ad2openldap worked by taking a complete dump of AD users/groups, stopping OpenLDAP,\nemptying the database, and reloading all of it. As that made OpenLDAP unavailable (sometimes for\nextended periods) during updates, two new methods were implemented. First, a comparison is made\nbetween the current AD dump and the last one, with only the changes being propagated to OpenLDAP\nlive. Second, it's much faster to populate the OpenLDAP database by directly constructing such a\ndatabase from a template (LDIF file) rather than incrementally deleting all and adding all.\n\nFor detailed information about using ad2openldap, please see the man page - ad2openldap(8).\n\nTo get started after installing the ad2openldap package, several settings must first be configured\nin /etc/ad2openldap/ad2openldap.conf. A note on security, ad2openldap.conf must be 640 and\nroot.openldap.\n\nIn its current state, ad2opendap is targeted at Ubuntu. With a few slight modifications or perhaps\nonly configuration setting changes, it shouldn't be terribly difficult to run on other\ndistributions.\n\nAn update usually consists of three steps:\n\n::\n\n    Groups, users, and NIS group entries are dumped from AD\n\n    If a previous dump is present on the LDAP server, a comparison is made \n    between the two updates.  If they differ, a list of LDAP server update \n    transactions is generated.\n\n    If an update is necessary due to changes from last time, the update \n    transactions are entered into the local LDAP server.\n\nOn each LDAP server, the following tools are used:\n\n::\n\n    ad2openldap - update script invoked by cron via /etc/crontab\n\nIn the event that an incremental update is not possible or bypassed using the command line parameter\n'--fullsync', a full update will instead occur.\n\nA full update:\n\n::\n\n    Dumps groups, users and NIS group entities from AD\n    Locks out remote access to the LDAP server via the firewall\n    Shuts down the LDAP server\n    Writes a new blank database using the LDIF template\n    Directly imports AD dump into database\n    Restarts LDAP server\n    Removes firewall block on LDAP server\n\nTroubleshooting:\n\nUse the --verbose flag to log to STDOUT/STDERR.\n\nThe AD dumps and diffs are in /tmp by default:\n\n::\n\n    ad_export.ldif - current dump\n    ad_export.ldif.0 - last dump\n    ad_export_delta.diff - computed differences between these files\n\nPossible failure modes are:\n\nLDAP server failure - needs restart, possibly followed by forced full update if corrupt or\nincomplete\n\nFirewall block still improperly active - look at update script for removal syntax (this failure is\nvery unlikely given the current process)\n\nBad or conflicting AD entities - a forced full update should remedy this\n",
