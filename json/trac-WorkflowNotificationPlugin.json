    "description": "WorkflowNotificationPlugin enables flexible configuration of email\nnotifications tied to ticket workflow changes.\n\nAdministrators can configure any number of distinct email\nnotifications to be sent out when a workflow operation occurs on a\nticket. Each email notification is specifically attached to one or\nmore workflow operations, so (for example) separate emails can be sent\nout when a ticket is accepted, reassigned, resolved, reopened, or\nmarked \"in QA\". \n\nEach email notification's subject, body, and recipients are fully\nconfigurable by administrators, as Genshi templates which have access\nto the ticket's data, the comment (if any) that was left on the\nticket, and the author of the change. Therefore notifications can be\nvery flexible: some notifications can be sent to the ticket's\nreporter, others to its owner or CC list, others to the current\nupdater, and others to hard-coded lists of users.\n\nThe notification emails sent by this plugin respect trac's ALWAYS_CC\nand ALWAYS_BCC settings.\n\nThe notification emails sent by this plugin are orthogonal to trac's\nALWAYS_NOTIFY_UPDATER, ALWAYS_NOTIFY_OWNER, and ALWAYS_NOTIFY_REPORTER\nsettings; Trac's built-in email notifications will be sent according\nto those settings, independent of this plugin's emails.\n\n== Installation ==\n\nInstall the plugin's source code:\n{{{\n$ easy_install trac-WorkflowNotificationPlugin\n}}}\n\nEnable its components in trac.ini:\n{{{\n[components]\nworkflow_notification.* = enabled\n}}}\n\nAdd its component to your list of workflow providers, after all other\nworkflow providers; for example:\n{{{\n[ticket]\nworkflow = ConfigurableTicketWorkflow, TicketWorkflowNotifier\n}}}\n\nNow you just need to configure some notifications; see below for\ndetails and examples.\n\n== Configuration == \n\nConfigure one or more notification emails attached to workflow events\nusing a `ticket-workflow-notifications` section in `trac.ini`.\n\nWithin this section, each entry is a notification email that may be\nsent out for a ticket.  Here is an example:\n{{{\n[ticket-workflow-notifications]\nnotify_reporter_when_accepted = accept\nnotify_reporter_when_accepted.body = Hi $ticket.reporter, '$ticket.summary' has been accepted by $change.author. Its status is now $ticket.status.\\n\\n{% if change.comment %}$change.author said:\\n\\n$change.comment{% end %}-----\\nTicket URL: $link\\n$project.name <${project.url or abs_href()}>\\n$project.descr\nnotify_reporter_when_accepted.recipients = $ticket.reporter, trac-admin@hostname.com, trac_user\nnotify_reporter_when_accepted.subject = '$ticket.summary' is now accepted\n}}}\n\nThe first line in this example defines the\n`notify_reporter_when_accepted` rule. The value in this line defines\none or more workflow actions that will trigger this notification: in\nthis case, the notification will be triggered when the \"accept\" action\noccurs for any ticket.  (This action is defined by the default\nconfiguration of Trac's built in ticket workflow engine; however, any\naction that is defined by the configuration of your installed\nITicketActionControllers may be used.)\n\nWe could also define a notification to occur on multiple workflow\nactions, using a comma separated list of workflow actions:\n{{{\nnotify_owner_changed = accept, reassign\n}}}\n\nMultiple independent notifications can be configured for the same\nworkflow action; in the above examples, both the\n`notify_owner_changed` and the `notify_reported_when_accepted` rules\nwill be triggered when the \"accept\" action occurs.\n\nThe following lines define the email subject, body, and recipients for\na particular notification.  These are all Genshi Text Templates that\nwill be rendered with a context that includes the ticket in its\ncurrent state AFTER the workflow action has been applied; the ticket's\nvalues before any changes were made, as an `old_ticket` dictionary; the\nauthor and comment of the current change, if any; a link to the ticket as\n`$link`; and the project.\n\nAll of these must be defined for each notification; the plugin will\nraise errors at runtime if a notification is missing any of the\n`.subject`, `.body` or `.recipients` definitions.\n\nThe `.recipients` definition should be a Genshi template that renders\nto a comma separated list of email addresses and/or usernames known to\nTrac.  In the above example we combine a dynamic variable based on the\nticket's current state, a username known to Trac, and a hard coded\nemail address:\n{{{\nnotify_reporter_when_accepted.recipients = $ticket.reporter, trac-admin@hostname.com, trac_user\n}}}\n\n=== Conditional Notifications ===\n\nIn addition to the required configuration fields described above, you can \noptionally include a `.condition` definition for a notification.  If provided,\nthis should be a Genshi text template which evaluates to the value True if and\nonly if the notification should be sent.  If the template evaluates to any value\nother than True, the notification will be skipped.  \n\nIf no `.condition` is provided, then the notification will be sent unconditionally\nwhen it is triggered.\n\nOne use for this would be sending a notification when a ticket is resolved 'fixed':\n\n{{{\n[ticket-workflow-notifications]\nwhen_fixed = resolve\nwhen_fixed.body = Ticket $ticket.id has been fixed!  View it here: $link\nwhen_fixed.subject = Ticket $ticket.id is fixed!\nwhen_fixed.recipients = $ticket.cc\nwhen_fixed.condition = ${ticket.resolution == 'fixed'}\n}}}\n\nBut you could get as complex as you want with this feature:\n\n{{{\nmagic_word.condition = ${'notifyme' in change.comment and change.author != ticket.reporter}\n}}}\n\n==== Notifications for new tickets ====\n\nMost notifications are configured to refer to one or more workflow actions, \nlike \"accept\", \"leave\", \"reassign\", \"resolve\", etc.\n\nYou can also configure notifications to be triggered when a ticket is\nnewly created. To do this, use the special workflow action `@created`\nlike so:\n\n{{{\n[ticket-workflow-notifications]\nnew_ticket = @created\nnew_ticket.body = New ticket $ticket.summary has been created\nnew_ticket.recipients = $ticket.owner\nnew_ticket.subject = New ticket created\n}}}\n\n==== Notifications for all actions ====\n\nYou can also set the special value `*` for a notification, which means\nit will be triggered on every workflow action excluding ticket creation:\n\n{{{\n[ticket-workflow-notifications]\nticket_changed = *\nticket_changed.body = View the ticket here: $link\nticket_changed.recipients = watchful_user, another_watchful_user\nticket_changed.subject = Ticket $ticket.id has changed!\n}}}\n\nTo trigger a notification for every workflow action as well as ticket \ncreation, just specify both:\n{{{\n[ticket-workflow-notifications]\nticket_changed = *, @created\n}}}\n\n\n==== Accessing old ticket values =====\n\nThe ticket's old values are available in the notification templates.\nThese values are provided in a Python dict named `old_values`.  The\nvalues provided are from before any changes were made to the ticket,\nwhether by workflow operations or by direct user action.\n\nYou can use this dictionary to set up a notification similar to Trac's\nbuilt in ticket change email; for example:\n{{{\n[ticket-workflow-notifications]\nticket_changed = *\nticket_changed.body = Ticket changed by $change.author: $change.comment\n                      {% for field in old_ticket %}{% if old_ticket[field] != ticket[field] %}\n\t\t      $field changed: ${old_ticket[field]} => ${ticket[field]}{% end %}{% end %}\nticket_changed.recipients = $ticket.reporter\nticket_changed.subject = Ticket $ticket.id has changed!\n}}}\n0.5 (2013-11-21)\n----------------\n\n * Notifications can now be configured through Trac's web admin system.\n\n0.4 (2012-12-12)\n----------------\n\n * Support for Trac 0.11.7\n\n0.3 (2012-12-11)\n----------------\n\n * Allow configuration of conditional notifications.\n * Provide `action` string in templates.\n\n0.2 (2012-12-10)\n----------------\n\n * Provide `old_values` dict in templates.\n * '*'-notifications are no longer triggered for @created actions.\n\n0.1 (2012-12-09)\n----------------\n\nEverything is new!",
