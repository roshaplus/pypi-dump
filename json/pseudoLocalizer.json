    "description": "Pseudolocalizing is one technique for validating the translation-readiness of \r\nyour software.  It allows you to run and test your software with strings that \r\nare distinctly non-English but still quite readable.  Lingering hardcoded \r\nEnglish strings are exposed.  Logic dependencies on specific English values \r\nbecome apparent.  Dialog sizing problems are visible.  A single pass at \r\npseudolocalizing can be done with any editor but it is useful to have a \r\nconsistent transformation that you can apply repeatedly as you iterate through \r\nbuild and test cycles.",
