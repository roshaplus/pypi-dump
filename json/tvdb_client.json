    "description": "tvdb_client: A python client library for the new TVDB API\n=========================================================\n\nThe tvdb_client provides integration with the TheTVDB API and allows interaction with all of its public APIs in both\nversions: V1 and V2.\n\nThe tvdb_client library will provide different client classes for the V1 and V2 API versions from TheTVDB for they are\nvery different conceptually and technically (V1 is HTTP Get request based with XML response, while V2 is all RESTful JSON\nbased).\n\nThis library is powered by the fantastic `python Requests library <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests>`_ and the\nawesome `python lxml <https://github.com/lxml/lxml>`_.\n\n**tvdb_client is not supported nor endorsed by TheTVDB.**\n\nClient Classes\n--------------\n\n- **ApiV1Client:** Provides access to TheTVDB V1 APIs which are based on HTTP Get requests with XML based responses. The API documentation from TheTVDB can be found `HERE <http://www.thetvdb.com/wiki/index.php/Programmers_API#Dynamic_Interfaces>`_.\n- **ApiV2Client:** Provides access to TheTVDB V2 APIs which are all RESTfull JSON APIs. The API information is very well documented `HERE <https://api.thetvdb.com/swagger>`_.\n\nV1 API Client\n`````````````\nThe V1 API Client is implemented by class ApiV1Client. Its constructor takes the api key, as required by TheTVDB.\n\nCurrently, the implementation of the methods for its APIs is under development.\n\n\nV2 API Client\n`````````````\n\nThe V2 API Client is implemented on class ApiV2Client. Its constructor receives the user identification (api key,\nusername and account identified) as required by TheTVDB and optionally the language option.\n\nThis client implements method for all the APIs documented in `TheTVDB swagger <https://api.thetvdb.com/swagger>`_ with\nthe exception of those that returns information on the parameters required for certain APIs.\n\nThe client is very easy to use as provided by the example below:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> from tvdb_client import ApiV2Client\n    >>> api_client = ApiV2Client('USERNAME', 'API_KEY', 'ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER')\n    >>> api_client.login()\n    >>> api_client.is_authenticated\n    True\n    >>> series = api_client.search_series(name='Game of Thrones')\n    >>> print series\n    {u'data': [{u'status': u'Continuing', u'network': u'HBO', u'overview': u\"Seven noble families fight for control of\n    the mythical land of Westeros.
