For example:\n\n* Sales Quotation can have an estimation supported by a BR analysis\n* Project Tasks can be related to the BRs they implement or support\n* Procurement and purchase can be generated out of the BR\n\n.. figure:: ../business_requirement/static/img/bus_req_module_diag.png\n   :width: 600 px\n   :alt: Business Requirement modules diagram\n\nThe following workflow explains the business workflow between the BR modules and other applications in Odoo:\n\n.. figure:: ../business_requirement/static/img/bus_req_workflow.png\n   :width: 600 px\n   :alt: Business Requirement integration in Odoo\n\n\nHow to use this module?\n-----------------------\n\nThis module only contains the standard base models for business requirement:\n\n* BR model definition\n* Standard setup and views\n* Standard Workflow\n\n.. figure:: ../business_requirement/static/img/bus_req.png\n   :width: 600 px\n   :alt: Business Requirement Form\n\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nUsers\n-----\n\n* **Business Requirement User**: can create and confirm a BR\n* **Business Requirement Manager**: can create, confirm and approve a BR\n\nAlias and emails\n----------------\nYou can setup an alias in Settings/Technical/Email/Alias in order to create \nbusiness requirements directly from email received at a specific address.\n\n.. figure:: ../business_requirement/static/img/bus_req_alias.png\n   :width: 600 px\n   :alt: Email Alias setup\n\nYou can start conversation with the followers in the chatter area of the \nBR like in tasks, issue or CRM leads.\n\nSequences\n---------\n\nDefault numbering format: BR123456.\n\nYou can modify the default numbering sequence in Settings/Technical/Sequences&Identifier/Sequences.\n\nSearch for Business Requirement sequence and alter it if necessary.\n\nTags\n----\n\nYou can create and assign tags for your business requirements in Business Requirements/Configuration/Bus. Req. Category\n\n.. figure:: ../business_requirement/static/img/bus_req_tags.png\n   :width: 600 px\n   :alt: Define Tags\n\n\nMaster project\n--------------\n\nYou can define a master project linked to the business requirement.\n\nFollowers from the project will automatically be added to the business requirements.\n\n\nUsage\n=====\nSimple BR\n---------\n\n1. Define the header information\n\n   * Master Project (Partner is the one related to the master project)\n   * Priority (low, Medium, High)\n   * Change request: Is it a change request? (currently only informational with n model or action)\n   * Tags: any relevant tag for the business.\n   * Owner and approver by default\n\n   .. figure:: ../business_requirement/static/img/bus_req_tags2.png\n      :width: 600 px\n      :alt: Input header information\n\n2. Input the customer story, scenario gap and test case(simple html editor with image and text)\n\n   .. figure:: ../business_requirement/static/img/bus_req_cust_story.png\n      :width: 600 px\n      :alt: Input customer story, scenario, gap and test case\n\n3. Confirm the Business requirement (for BR User and Manager)\n   At that stage the Customer story/Scenario/Gap/Test case is not modifiable anymore\n\n   .. figure:: ../business_requirement/static/img/bus_req_confirmed.png\n      :width: 600 px\n      :alt: Confirm your business requirement\n\n4. Approve the Business requirement (for BR Manager)\n\n   .. figure:: ../business_requirement/static/img/bus_req_approved.png\n      :width: 600 px\n      :alt: Confirm your business requirement\n\n5. Once your requirement is finished and delivered you can set it as Done\n\n   .. figure:: ../business_requirement/static/img/bus_req_done.png\n      :width: 600 px\n      :alt: Confirm your business requirement\n\n6. Alternatively, you can cancel the BR (in case it is not relevant or mistake) or drop it (when customer makes the decision to discontinue it)\n\n   .. figure:: ../business_requirement/static/img/bus_req_cancel.png\n      :width: 600 px\n      :alt: Cancel your business requirement\n\n\n   .. figure:: ../business_requirement/static/img/bus_req_drop.png\n      :width: 600 px\n      :alt: Drop your business requirement\n\n\nSub-business requirements\n-------------------------\nUser can create sub business requirements for a given BR for complex cases.\n\nThis is a simple parent/child relation (see roadmap).\n\n.. figure:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/222/10.0\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* Multi-company management\n* Full change request management\n* Analytic account management\n* Complex relationship management\n* Integration with earned-value module.\n* Improve the followers details (eg: depending on the stages)\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/business-requirement/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed feedback.\n\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n* Eric Caudal <eric.caudal@elico-corp.com>\n* Alex Duan <alex.duan@elico-corp.com>\n* Xie XiaoPeng <xie.xiaopeng@elico-corp.com>\n* Victor M.
