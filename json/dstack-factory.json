    "description": "dstack-factory\n==============\n\ndstack-factory consists of two components: (1) ``factory`` and (2) ``runtime``.\n\n``factory`` is a service that builds (or downloads) python wheels from a pip requirements file or from a wheel package uploaded to the wheelhouse. If a python package is already available as wheel package, it is cached. Otherwise the source is downloaded from pip, git or any other source supported by pip and compiled/packaged as a wheel file.\n\nExamples of python packages that currently still need to be build are:\n   - psycopg2\n   - lxml\n   - pycrypto\n   - pillow\n   - weasyprint (and it's dependencies)\n   - anything hosted on GitHub, e.g. forks of python packages or unreleased versions\n\n``runtime`` is a base docker image that contains all the necessary libraries to run most popular python packages with external dependencies. For example pandas, matplotlib, weasyprint, etc. all require non-python libraries.\nIn addition to the base runtime docker image, ``dstack-factory`` also provides three entry point Dockerfiles to support different workflows for building and deploying docker and python based applications.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe documentation can be found at: https://pythonhosted.org/dstack-factory/\n\n\n",
