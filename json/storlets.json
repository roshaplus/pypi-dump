    "description": "Storlets\n========\n\nStorlets extend Swift with the ability to run user defined computations\n- called storlets - near the data in a secure and isolated manner.\nA storlet is a compiled and packaged code (e.g. a .jar file) that can be\nuploaded to Swift as any other object.\nOnce uploaded the storlet can be invoked over data objects in Swift.\nThe Storlets API is documented at\n`\"Storlets API v1\" <http://storlets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/overview_api.html>`__.\n\nThe project started off as an IBM research project, and was open sourced by IBM in 2014.\n\n- The research leading to the development of this code received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under the grant agreements for the CASPAR, ENSURE and VISION Cloud projects.\n- Various stages and different aspects of the development of this code received funding from the following European Community's Framework Programme:\n\n  - Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under the grant agreements for the ForgetIT project, where the code is used for offloading digital preservation functionalities to the storage.\n  - Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under the grant agreements for COSMOS project, where the code is used for analysis of IoT data.\n  - Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under the grant agreements for FI-CORE project where the code is integrated with a holistic cloud deployment solution, and from\n  - Horizon 2020 (H2020/2014-2020) under the grant agreement for the IOStack project where the code is used as a backend implementing Storage policies and is used for analytics\n\nDocs\n----\n\nThe storlerts documentation is auto-generated after every commit and available\nonline at http://storlets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nThe fastest way to get started is\n`\"S2AIO - Swift Storlets All In One\" <http://storlets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`__.\n\nFor Engine Developers\n---------------------\n\nGetting Started\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe best way to get started is following this guide:\n`\"Installing a Development Environment\" <http://storlets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/engine_dev_installation.html>`__.\n\nTests\n~~~~~\n\nThere are two types of tests included in the Storlets repo.\n\n #. Unit tests\n #. Functional tests\n\nUnit tests, are, well, unit tests... The functional tests are black box tests validating\nend-to-end scenarios using various storlets, including faulty ones. For more information\nplease refer to the:\n`\"Development and Testing Guide\" <http://storlets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/engine_dev_tests.html>`__.\n\nCode Organization\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Engine/: The code comprising the middleware and the compute engine\n\n  - SBus/: A protocol layer between the middleware and the sandbox used to execute storlets\n\n    - SBusJavaFacade/: A Java implementation of the protocol\n    - SBusPythonFacade/: A Python implementation of the protocol\n    - SBusTransportLayer/: A thin layer in \"C\" used for passing fds between the middleware and container\n\n  - SCommon/: A Java library required for storlets development\n  - SDaemon/: A generic Java daemon for loading storlets at runtime\n  - SMSCripts/: Run time scripts for doing Docker management commands\n  - agent/: Python code for Docker side storlets process management\n  - swift/: Python swift side code\n\n    - etc/: Sample config files\n    - storlet_gateway/: Run time loadable code for managing storlets execution\n    - storlet_middleware/: Swift middleware dealing with storlet invocation requests\n\n- StorletSamples/: Storlets examples, used for functional testing\n- doc/source/: Documentation\n- install/: Installation scripts\n\n  - swift/: Scripts for invoking an extenral Swift ansible installation scrpts\n  - storlets/: Scripts for installing storlets over a Swift cluster\n\n- tests/: Unit and functional tests\n\n- tools/: Various cluster config dependent tools for automatic and manual testing\n\nFor Storlets Developers\n-----------------------\n\nCurrently, storlets can be developped in Java only.\nTo get started, follow:\n`\"S2AIO - Swift Storlets All In One\" <http://storlets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`__.\n\nThe write and deploy a storlet, follow:\n`\"Writing and deploying storelts\" <http://storlets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writing_and_deploying_storlets.html>`__.\n\nFor Deployers\n-------------\n\nInstructions for how to deploy Storlets over an existing Swift cluster (not SAIO):\n`\"Deploying storlets over an existing Swift cluster\" <http://storlets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployer_installation.html>`__.\n\n\n\n",
