    "description": "This single module provides the following classes:\r\n  * Point: represents a single point or vector of arbitrary dimension\r\n  * Pointset: represents a set of points or vectors of arbitrary dimension\r\n  * Aarray: represents an anisotropic array (subclasses numpy.ndarray)\r\n  * Quaternion: represents a quaternion (to describe 3D rotations)\r\n\r\nThe Point and Pointset classes have several methods for mathematical operations such as calculating angles and cross products.",
