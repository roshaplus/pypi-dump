    "description": "Patchit\r\n=======\r\n\r\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/EisenSheng/patchit.png?branch=develop\r\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/EisenSheng/patchit\r\n    :alt: ci build status\r\n\r\nPatchit is an MIT Licensed unified diff parsing and merge tool written in\r\nPython for anyone who needs a finer grain of control over unified diff\r\ncontent and to merge the diff with an arbitrary stream of lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this package arose from the\r\n\r\n- overwhelming complexity of other patching tools written in Python,\r\n- their absence from the PyPI,\r\n- their inability to inspect the unified diff content and\r\n- missing support to merge the patch with an arbitrary stream of lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nTo install patchit just run from the root of the project:\r\n\r\n.. code-block:: bash\r\n\r\n    $ python setup.py install\r\n\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n-------\r\n\r\nTests are located at the `tests.py` file. In order to test your new\r\ncontribution to patchit just run from your shell\r\n\r\n.. code-block:: bash\r\n\r\n    $ python setup.py test\r\n\r\n\r\nContribute\r\n----------\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I wasn't able to make it much better myself. Therefore I'm\r\nasking anyone who is interested in a patch functionality for Python to\r\nimprove this package and hand in patches by mail or pull requests.\r\n\r\nThe preferred method of development is a test driven approach and following\r\nthe nvie git flow branching model. Please be so kind to bear these things in\r\nmind when handing in improvements. Thank you very much.",
