    "description": "PyUI is a user interface library written entirely in the high-level language python. It has a modular implementation that allows the drawing and event input to be performed by pluggable \"renderers\". This makes PyUI very portable and scalable. It can run in environments from hardware accelerated 3D surfaces to regular desktop windows. PyUI was originally targeted as a User Interface for games, but it has evolved into a more general UI toolkit with applicability outside of games.",
