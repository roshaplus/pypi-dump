Chorus Pro is the electronic invoicing plateform of the French administration. All the suppliers of the French administration can send their invoices through Chorus and it is progressively becoming an obligation for all suppliers. To know more about Chorus and the obligation to send electronic invoices to the French administration, read `the dedicated page <https://www.economie.gouv.fr/entreprises/marches-publics-facture-electronique>`_ on the website of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nRefer to the README of the module *l10n_fr_chorus_account*.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nIn the menu *Accounting > Customers > Customer Invoices*, create an invoice for the French Administration. Validate the invoice. Then click on the button *Generate UBL XML File* and download the generated XML file.\n\nThen log into `Chorus Pro <https://chorus-pro.gouv.fr/>`_. Go to the menu *Factures \u00e9mises > D\u00e9p\u00f4t factures* or, in the welcome screen *Accueil connect\u00e9*, in the section *Acc\u00e8s Rapide*, click on the button *D\u00e9poser une facture*. Then, in the pop-up, select:\n\n1. *Format de d\u00e9p\u00f4t*: *XML structur\u00e9*\n2. *Syntaxe*: *UBL Invoice*\n3. *Structure*: should display the name of your company.\n4. *Choix du fichier \u00e0 importer*: select the UBL XML file generated by Odoo.\n\nand click on *Continuer*.\n\nOnce the invoice has been successfully uploaded, you should find the invoice in the menu *Factures \u00e9mises > Rechercher* or in the menu *Factures \u00e9mises > Tableau de bord* and you should be able to see the status of the invoice. If there is an error in the XML syntax, you will receive an email several hours after the upload with the details of the error (in my experience, it was 14h after the upload !).\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/121/10.0\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\nAdd support for the automatic transmission of invoices to Chorus via API (but it requires a RGS 1 star certificate, which costs about 250 \u20ac / year)\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/l10n-france/issues>`_.
