It takes care of all structure related programming a let's you\nfocus on the important things in life: **control design**\nIt features a modular control loop structure that already contains most of the\nneeded blocks a control engineer needs. Basically you implement your systems\ndynamics as well as a fancy control law and you are ready to go.\nOn top PyMoskito also contains a GUI which let's you easily fine-tune the\nparameters of your simulation.\n\n**Go ahead and give it a try!**\n\nDocumentation can be found at https://pymoskito.readthedocs.org.\n\nPyMoskito at work:\n------------------\nThe main application simulating the **Ball and Beam** system:\n\n.. image:: ./docs/pictures/pm_2.png\n\nThe postprocessing application:\n\n.. image:: ./docs/pictures/pm_3.png\n\nAnother example a **Double Pendulum**:\n\n.. image:: ./docs/pictures/pm_4.png\n\nwith custom prostprocessors:\n\n.. image:: ./docs/pictures/pm_5.png\n\nStill here? So PyMoskito features:\n----------------------------------\n* quick setup due to lightweight dependencies\n* modular control loop structure allowing easy configuration\n* easy integration of own system models through open interface\n* automatic simulation of simulation regimes (i.e. for parameter ranges)\n* export of simulation results for dedicated post processing\n* VTK based 3D visualization interface\n* playback functions for 3D visualization\n* ready-to-go graphs for all simulation signals\n\nMaintainers\n-----------\n* Stefan Ecklebe\n* Christoph Burggraf\n\nContributors\n------------\nMarcus Riesmeier\n\n\n\n\n=======\nHistory\n=======\n0.2.1 (2017-09-07)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed issue when installing via pip\n* Fixed issue with metaprocessors and added example metaprocessor for ballbeam\n\n0.2.0 (2017-08-18)\n------------------\n\n* Second minor release with lots of new features.\n* Completely overhauled graphical user interface with menus and shortcuts.\n* PyMoskito now comes with three full-fledged examples from the world of\n  control theory, featuring the Ball and Beam- and a Tandem-Pendulum system.\n* The main application now has a logger window which makes it easier to see what\n  is going on in the simulation circuit.\n* Several bugs concerning encoding issues have been fixed\n* Unittest have been added and the development now uses travis-ci\n* Version change from PyQt4 to Pyt5\n* Version change form Python 2.7 to 3.5+\n* Changed version to GPLv3 and added appropriate references for the used images.\n* Improved the export of simulation results\n* Introduced persistent settings that make opening files less painful.\n* Made vtk an optional dependency and added matplotlib based visualizers.\n* Large improvements concerning the sphinx-build documentation\n* Fixed issue concerning possible data types for simulation module properties\n* Introduced new generic modules that directly work on scipy StateSpace objects.\n\n0.1.0 (2015-01-11)\n------------------\n\n* First release on PyPI.",
