    "description": "|Build Status| |Coverage Status| |Code Climate|\n\nDescription\n===========\n\n``edx-dl`` is a simple tool to download videos and lecture materials\nfrom Open edX-based sites. It requires a\n`Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ interpreter (>= 2.7) and very few\nother dependencies. It is platform independent, and should work fine\nunder Unix (Linux, BSDs etc.), Windows or Mac OS X.\n\nWe strongly recommend that, if you don't already have a Python\ninterpreter installed, that you `install Python >=\n3.4 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__, if possible, since it has\nbetter security than Python 2.\n\nInstallation (recommended)\n==========================\n\nTo install edx-dl run:\n\n::\n\n    pip install edx-dl\n\nManual Installation\n===================\n\nTo install all the dependencies please do:\n\n::\n\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nyoutube-dl\n----------\n\nOne of the most important dependencies of ``edx-dl`` is ``youtube-dl``.\nThe installation step listed above already pulls in the most recent\nversion of ``youtube-dl`` for you.\n\nUnfortunately, since many Open edX sites store their videos on Youtube\nand Youtube changes their layout from time to time, it may be necessary\nto upgrade your copy of ``youtube-dl``. There are many ways to proceed\nhere, but the simplest is to simply use:\n\n::\n\n    pip install --upgrade youtube-dl\n\nQuick Start\n===========\n\nOnce you have installed everything, to use ``edx-dl.py``, let it\ndiscover the courses in which you are enrolled, by issuing:\n\n::\n\n    edx-dl -u user@user.com --list-courses\n\nFrom there, choose the course you are interested in, copy its URL and\nuse it in the following command:\n\n::\n\n    edx-dl -u user@user.com COURSE_URL\n\nreplacing ``COURSE_URL`` with the URL that you just copied in the first\nstep. It should look something like:\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/edX/DemoX.1/2014/info\n\nYour downloaded videos will be placed in a new directory called\n``Downloaded``, inside your current directory, but you can also choose\nanother destination with the ``-o`` argument.\n\nTo see all available options and a brief description of what they do,\nsimply execute:\n\n::\n\n    edx-dl --help\n\n*Important Note:* To use sites other than edx.org, you have to specify\nthe site along with the ``-x`` option. For example, ``-x stanford``, if\nthe course that you want to get is hosted on Stanford's site.\n\nDocker container\n================\n\nYou can run this application via `Docker <https://docker.com>`__ if you\nwant. Just install docker and run\n\n::\n\n    docker run --rm -it \\\n           -v \"$(pwd)/edx/:/Downloaded\" \\\n           strm/edx-dl -u <USER> -p <PASSWORD>\n\nReporting issues\n================\n\nBefore reporting any issue please follow the steps below:\n\n1. Verify that you are running the latest version of all the programs\n   (both of ``edx-dl`` and of ``youtube-dl``). Use the following command\n   if in doubt:\n\n   ::\n\n       pip install --upgrade edx-dl\n\n2. If the problem persists, feel free to `open an\n   issue <https://github.com/coursera-dl/edx-dl/issues>`__ in our\n   bugtracker, please fill the issue template with *as much information\n   as possible*.\n\nSupported sites\n===============\n\nThese are the current supported sites:\n\n-  `edX <http://edx.org>`__\n-  `Stanford <http://lagunita.stanford.edu/>`__\n-  `University of Sydney <http://online.it.usyd.edu.au>`__\n-  `France Universit\u00e9\n   Num\u00e9rique <https://www.france-universite-numerique-mooc.fr/>`__\n-  `GW Online SEAS <http://openedx.seas.gwu.edu/>`__ - George Washington\n   University\n-  `GW Online Open <http://mooc.online.gwu.edu/>`__ - George Washington\n   University\n\nThis is the full `list of sites powered by Open\nedX <https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Sites-powered-by-Open-edX>`__.\nNot all of them are supported at the moment, we welcome you to\ncontribute support for them and send a pull request also via our `issue\ntracker <https://github.com/coursera-dl/edx-dl/issues>`__.\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\nSee the contributors to the project in the\n`AUTHORS.md <https://github.com/coursera-dl/edx-dl/blob/master/AUTHORS.md>`__\nfile.
