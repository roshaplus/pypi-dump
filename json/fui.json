    "description": "By *selecting* filenames/directories into a selection set you can add and remove names quite simply. Once done, you'd go to another directory (even in another console or tab) and then you can copy (or move) the selection to there.\n\n(So, you can select some files using normal wildcards; here for example, all the png files):\n  ``fui bling blang bong *.png``\n(Then move to another folder) \n  ``cd someotherplace``\n(Add some more files)\n  ``fui socks shorts shirts`` \n(Then you decide you don't want *shorts* or *wibble.png*)\n  ``fui --exclude shorts wibble.png``\n(Now you want to copy those somewhere)\n  ``cd whereIwantStuff``\n\n  ``fui --copy``\n\n(done!)\n\nCopying/moving is done recursively when directories are involved. More help is available via --help\n\nThe idea was to imitate the process in a typical file-manager gui. I know there are many ways to do this with grep and backticks and other tricks, but I wanted a simple way that I could remember :)\n\n**Caution:** This is alpha software and I have not tested it nearly enough. Don't go using it on your vital data because it might eat it all up. Certainly give it a go until you get the feel and start to trust it.\n\nI hope it helps someone out there.",
