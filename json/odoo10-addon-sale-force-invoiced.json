Create a sales order and confirm it.\n#. Deliver the products/services.\n#. Create an invoice and reduce the invoiced quantity. The sales order\n   invoicing status is 'To Invoice'.\n#. Lock the Sale Order, to change the status of it to 'Done'.\n#. Check the field 'Force Invoiced'\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/167/10.0\n\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/sale-workflow/issues>`_.
