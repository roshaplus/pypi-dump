    "description": "pyDAWG implements DAWG structure. Testing if word is present in a set has complexity O(n), where n is length of tested string.\r\n\r\nAlgorithm used to build DAWG is **incremental**, memory overhead during graph construction is small.\r\n\r\nModule supports also **minimal perfect hashing** --- it is possible to get unique number for any word from a set, or find which word has assigned given number. This makes possible to use DAWG as a dictionary.\r\n\r\nThe module has been written in C. There is also a pure python version providing most of C version functionality.",
