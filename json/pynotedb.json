    "description": "===============================\npynotedb\n===============================\n\nThis will be a python parser for NoteDB. This repository is currently empty.\n\nAbout NoteDB\n------------\n\nNoteDB is a way of organising review content so that it is stored as \ngit objects in the same git repo as the code,\noriginally created by the people at gerrit. See here for more:\n\nhttps://gerrit.googlesource.com/homepage/+/md-pages/docs/Notedb.md\n\nThis project\n------------\n\nThis is a WIP python NoteDB parser.\n\nThe goal is to make an API that can be used for code review,\nfor cases when teams wish to keep the details of review in the same place as \nthe code. By providing an API for NoteDB specifically, \nthere are multiple benefits, eg: review metadata is preserved if the code \nis moved and offline code review is possible.\n\nThe API itself will provide a pluggable interface for interacting with review \nmetadata, allowing people to more easily extend the ecosystem around code \nreview with custom components, and communicate with existing review systems.\n\nThe existing implementations for NoteDB parsers and APIs are in Java and Perl.\nAs python is a popular language, this python version is intended for better\ninteroperability with existing tools written in python.\n\n* Free software: Apache license\n* Documentation: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/pynotedb\n* Source: http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/pynotedb\n* Bugs: http://bugs.launchpad.net/pynotedb\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* TODO",
