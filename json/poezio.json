Its goal is to use anonymous\nconnections to simply let the user join MultiUserChats.  This way, the user\ndoesn't have to create a Jabber account, exactly like people are using\nIRC.  Poezio's commands are designed to be (if possible) like commonly\nused IRC clients (weechat, irssi, etc).\n\nSince version 0.7, poezio can handle real Jabber accounts along with\nroster and one-to-one conversations, making it a full-featured console\nJabber client, but still MultiUserChats-centered.\nIn the future, poezio should implement at a 100% level all XEP related to\nMUCs, especially XEP 0045.\n\n=======================\n    Install\n=======================\n\nYou need python 3.4 or higher (preferably the latest) and the associated devel\npackage, to build C modules, and the slixmpp python library.\nYou also need aiodns if you want SRV record support.\n\nAdditionally, you\u2019ll need sphinx to build the documentation pages.\nTo read the documentation without these dependancies just read the rst\nfiles in the doc/source/ directory or the generated documentation on the\nwebsite.\n\nThe simplest way to have up-to-date dependencies and to be able to test\nthis developement version is to use the ``update.sh`` script that downloads\nthem, places them in the right directory, and builds the C module.\n\nYou can then launch poezio with\n\n::\n\n    $ ./launch.sh\n\nyou can now simply launch ``poezio``\n\nYou can edit the configuration file which is located in\n``~/.config/poezio/poezio.cfg`` by default, and you will have to copy\nand edit ``data/default_config.cfg`` if you want to edit the config before\nthe first launch. The default config file is fully commented, but you can\nalso read the \u201cConfiguration\u201d documentation page which has links between\noptions and longer descriptions.\n\nPlease see the online documentation for more information on installing,\nconfiguring or using poezio: https://doc.poez.io/\n\nIf you still have questions, or if you're lost, don't hesitate to come\ntalk to us directly on our Jabber chat room (see Contact section).\n\nPlease DO report any bug you encounter and ask for any feature you want\n(we may implement it or not, but it\u2019s always better to ask).\n\n=======================\n    Authors\n=======================\n\n- Florent Le Coz (louiz\u2019) <louiz@louiz.org> (developer)\n- Mathieu Pasquet (mathieui) <mathieui@mathieui.net> (developer)\n\n=======================\n    Contact/support\n=======================\n\nJabber ChatRoom:   `poezio@muc.poez.io <xmpp:poezio@muc.poez.io?join>`_\n\nReport a bug:      https://dev.poez.io/new\n\n=======================\n    License\n=======================\n\nPoezio is Free Software.\n(learn more: http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)\n\nPoezio is released under the zlib License.\nPlease read the COPYING file for details.\n\nThe artwork logo was made by Ga\u00ebtan Rib\u00e9mont and released under\nthe Creative Commons BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/)\n\n\n=======================\n       Hacking\n=======================\n\nIf you want to contribute, you will be welcome on\n`poezio@muc.poez.io <xmpp:poezio@muc.poez.io?join>`_ to announce your\nideas, what you are going to do, or to seek help if you have trouble\nunderstanding some of the code.\n\nThe preferred way to submit changes is through a public git repository.\nBut mercurial repositories or simple patches are also welcome.\n\nFor contributors having commit access:\n\nThis section explains how the git repository is organized.\nThe \u201cmaster\u201d branch is the branch where all recent development is made.  This is\nthe unstable version, which can be broken, but we should try to keep it usable\nand crash-free as much as possible (so, never push to it if you are adding a\n*known* crash).\n\nNew big features that take time to be complete should be developed in feature\nbranches (for example the \u201cplugins\u201d or the \u201copt\u201d branches).\nIf it\u2019s a really long feature, merge the \u201cmaster\u201d branch in that feature branch\nfrom time to time, to avoid huge merges (and merge issues) when you\u2019ll have to\nmerge your feature back in \u201cmaster\u201d.\n\nMerge your work in master once it works and is usable, not necessarily when\nit\u2019s 100% finished.  Polishing and last bug fixes can take place in \u201cmaster\u201d.\n\nConflicts should be solved with *rebase* and not with merge.  This means\nthat if two developers commited one thing at the same time in their own\nrepository, the first pushes on the public public repos, and the other\nhas to pull before being able to push too.  In that case, the second\ndeveloper should use the rebase command instead of merge.  This avoids\ncreating unnecessary \u201cbranches\u201d and visible merges.\nOn the contrary, when merging feature branches back to \u201cmaster\u201d, we should\nuse merge with the --no-ff tag (this makes sure the branch will always\ndistinctly appear in the logs), even if no conflict occured.\n\nFinally, when a release is ready, we should merge the \u201cmaster\u201d branch\ninto the releases branch, then tag it to that version number.\nIf an \u201curgent\u201d bugfix has to be made for a release (for example\na security issue is discovered on the last stable version, and\nthe current master has evolved too much to be released in the current\nstate), we create a new bugfix branch from the \u201creleases\u201d branch, we fix\nit and finally merge it back to the \u201creleases\u201d branch, and tag it (and\nwe merge it to \u201cmaster\u201d as well, of course).\n\n\n=======================\n    Thanks\n=======================\n\n- People:\n    - Todd Eisenberger - Plugin system and OTR support\n    - J\u00e9r\u00f4me Parment (Manfraid) - Code, testing\n    - Link Mauve - Code, testing\n    - Akim Sadaoui - Code\n    - Florian Duraffourg - Code\n    - Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Meynadier - Code\n    - Georg Lukas - Code\n    - Johannes Krude - Code\n    - \u0141ab\u0119d\u017a - Code\n    - Lasse Aagren - Code\n    - Lancelot SIX - Code\n    - Luke Marlin - Code\n    - Maxim Buquet - Code\n    - Nicolas Braud-Santoni - Code\n    - Perdu - Code\n    - Eijebong - Code\n    - Ga\u00ebtan Rib\u00e9mont - Logo design\n    - Ovart - Testing\n    - Koshie - Donation\n    - Gapan - Makefile\n    - FlashCode (weechat dev) - Useful advices on how to use ncurses efficiently\n    - And all the people using and testing poezio, and especially the ones present\n      on the jabber chatroom doing bug reports and/or feature requests.",
