Adding\nnew quotes is easy::\n\n    $ jotquote add \"The larger the island of knowledge, the longer the shoreline of wonder. - James Madison\"\n    1 quote added for total of 639 quotes.\n\nStarting the web server\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIn some cases, the command-line might be good enough for viewing the quotes in your\ncollection, but you can start a web server that will show a quote of the day.\nThe ``jotquote webserver`` command can be used to start the webserver::\n\n    $ jotquote webserver\n    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5544/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n\nBy default, the web server is only accessible on the system on which\nit is running.  But by editing the settings.conf file, the web server can be\nmade accessible to computers on the network also.  See the section below about\nthe settings.conf file for details.\n\nThe quote file\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\njotquote stores the quotes in a text file that uses a human-friendly syntax\nand can be modified with a plain text editor if necessary.  Quotes are stored\nin the text file one per line using the syntax:\n\n<quote> | <author> | <publication> | <tag1, tag2, etc...>\n\nFor example:\n\nThe best way out is always through. | Robert Frost | A Servant to Servants | motivational, poetry\n\nYou can find the location of the quote file using the ``jotquote info`` command,\nand you can change the location by modifying the ``quote_file`` property in\nsettings.conf (see the settings.conf section below).\n\nThe text file is encoded in UTF-8 to allow the full Unicode character set.\n\nExtended functions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTo help you build your collection, the command-line interface has an extended set\nof functions including tagging and keyword searching.  Here are a couple of examples.\nTo display a random quote that has the 'motivational' tag, use the command::\n\n    $ jotquote random -t motivational\n\nOr to display all quotes that have the word 'Einstein' in the quote, author name,\nor publication name, use this command::\n\n    $ jotquote list -k Einstein\n\nThe help for these extended functions can be accessed with the '-h' argument;\nfor example, to see the help for the jotquote add function, use\nthe command::\n\n    $ jotquote add -h\n\nThe settings.conf file\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe behavior of the jotquote command is controlled with the settings.conf\nfile.  This file is always found at ~/.jotquote/settings.conf on Windows, Mac,\nand Linux.\n\nSupported environments\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\njotquote is tested on Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 on Windows, Mac, and Linux.\n\nCloud storage\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIf you'd like to make your quotes accessible from multiple computers, you can\nput your quote file in a cloud storage service such as Dropbox or Google Drive\nand then configure jotquote on each computer to use the file on your cloud\nstorage directory.  To do this, edit the settings.conf file and change the\n``quote_file`` property to the path to the file on your cloud storage drive.\n\nCredit\n~~~~~~\nThis package was inspired by other similar utilities including Ken Arnold's original\nUNIX utility ``fortune``.  This package also relies on the Flask and Click packages\nby Armin Ronacher.  The Click package was especially useful and resolved some headaches\nrelated to the earlier argparse-based implementation.\n\nContributing\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\nContributions are welcome!  See CONTRIBUTING.rst for contribution instructions.\n\n",
