    "description": "bead-calculator\r\n============\r\n\r\nA simple Python script to help peyote stitch beadworkers to figure out \r\nhow many beads to use to start a new project. \r\n\r\nBeadCalculator checks to make sure that the number of beads used in the project \r\nwill work mathematically and lets the beadworker know what design elements \r\nwill be possible for the number of starting beads entered. \r\n\r\n##To Use:\r\n\r\n1. Run the program.\r\n2. Measure the object that you'll be beading by stringing beads and wrapping \r\nthread around the object.\r\n3. Enter the number of beads from the initial measurement around the object.\r\n4. BeadCalculator tells you if that number of beads will work, and if it doesn't, \r\nBeadCalculator suggests an alternative number or numbers to start with. \r\n\r\nBeadCalculator also tells the beadworker how many bead to string, how many to add\r\n(when the first two lines of beads are added to the project), and what long \r\nand short side design elements will be available.\r\n\r\nTry it at http://bead-calculator.appspot.com/",
