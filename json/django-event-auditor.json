    "description": "This app provides models and methods for auditing business-level events - as opposed to just model changes (there are other auditing apps that do that). Business events are things that the business (i.e. not tech) would be interested in - the information is probably recorded elsewhere within the app, but this app provides a simplified, denormalised, structure that facilitates reporting.",
