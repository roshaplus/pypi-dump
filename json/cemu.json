    "description": "cemu\n====\n\n.. figure:: https://i.imgur.com/1vep3WM.png\n   :alt: cemu-linux\n\n   cemu-linux\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nWriting assembly is fun. Assembly is the lowest language (humanly\nunderstandable) available to communicate with computers, and is crucial\nto understand the internal mechanisms of any machine. Unfortunately,\nsetting up an environment to write, compile and run assembly for various\narchitectures (x86, ARM, MIPS, SPARC) has always been painful. **CEmu**\nis an attempt to fix this by providing a bundled GUI application that\nempowers users to write assembly and test it by compiling it to bytecode\nand executing it in an QEMU-based emulator.\n\n**Cheap EMUlator** combines all the advantages of a basic assembly IDE,\ncompilation and execution environment, by relying on the great libraries\n`Keystone <https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone>`__,\n`Unicorn <https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn/>`__ and\n`Capstone <https://github.com/aquynh/capstone>`__ engines in a Qt\npowered GUI.\n\nIt allows to test binary samples, check your shellcodes or even simply\nlearn how to write assembly code, all of this for the following\narchitectures:\n\n-  x86-32 / x86-64\n-  Arm / AArch64\n-  MIPS / MIPS64\n-  SPARC / SPARC64\n-  (more to come)\n\n``CEmu`` was tested and works on Linux, Windows and MacOSX.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nQuick install with PIP\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**Notes**:\n\n-  if you are using Kali Linux, there is a `known\n   problem <https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone/issues/235>`__\n   with the installation of the ``keystone-engine`` package using PIP. A\n   quick'n dirty fix for that would be (as ``root``):\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ sudo updatedb\n    $ sudo locate libkeystone.so\n    $ sudo ln -sf /path/to/libkeystone.so/found/above /usr/local/lib/libkeystone.so\n\n-  if you are using OSX, there is also a `known\n   issue <https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/issues/74>`__ when\n   installing ``capstone-engine`` from PIP, resulting in the ``.dylib``\n   not being deployed at the right location. A quick fix for it is\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    # locate the shared lib\n    $ find ~  -type f -name libcapstone.dylib\n    # link it in a valid correct library path\n    $ ln -sf /path/to/libcapstone.dylib/found/above /usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.2/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/capstone/libcapstone.dylib\n\nFrom PyPI\n^^^^^^^^^\n\nThis is the recommended way to install ``cemu`` as it will work out of\nthe box. You can install ``cemu`` on your system or using ``virtualenv``\nor ``pipenv``, by running:\n\n::\n\n    pip3 install --user --upgrade cemu\n\nFrom GitHub\n^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/hugsy/cemu && cd cemu\n    pip3 install --user --upgrade .\n\nManual installation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf for some reason the installation via PIP fails, you can always run\n``cemu`` by installing manually the following dependencies:\n\n-  ``unicorn`` and its Python bindings, as the emulation engine\n-  ``keystone`` and its Python bindings, as the assembly engine\n-  ``capstone`` and its Python bindings, as the disassembly engine\n-  ``PyQt5`` for the GUI\n-  ``pygments`` for the text colorization\n\nLinux / OSX\n^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nUse the script ``requirements.sh`` to install all the dependencies\nrequired for ``cemu``.\n\nSince some packages can be installed via your package manager, the\nscript may ask for your root password if required.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ ./requirements.sh\n\nBy default, the script will install the dependencies to have ``cemu``\nrunning with Python3. If you prefer to use Python2, simply add\n``--python2`` to the command line, like this:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ ./requirements.sh --python2\n\nWindows\n^^^^^^^\n\nThe fastest way for Windows is to install the packaged binaries for: \\*\nKeystone (http://www.keystone-engine.org/download/) \\* Capstone\n(http://www.capstone-engine.org/download) \\* Unicorn\n(http://www.unicorn-engine.org/download/)\n\nThen spawn ``cmd.exe`` and install the missing Python packages:\n``python-qt5``, ``pygments``).\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    C:>pip.exe install python-qt5 pygments\n\nIf you are running Python2, you will also need to install the package\n``enum34``.\n\nOpenReil integration\n--------------------\n\n```OpenREIL`` <https://github.com/Cr4sh/openreil>`__ is an Open Source\nlibrary created by [@Cr4sh](https://twitter.com/@d\\_olex) that\nimplements a translator and tools for generating Intermediate Language\nlevel code (REIL). OpenREIL library can be used optionally with\n``cemu``. The Current version of OpenREIL only provides support for x86\n(Intel) architecture.\n\nIf you use ``cemu`` with Python 2.7, you can also use\n```OpenReil`` <https://github.com/Cr4sh/openreil>`__ to generate IR code\nbased on the content of the ``Code`` panel.\n\n.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/R1wXLpG.png\n   :alt: cemu-openreil\n\n   cemu-openreil\n\nTo do so, follow the installation procedure for ``OpenReil`` by\nfollowing the steps `here <https://github.com/Cr4sh/openreil#_2>`__.\n\nContribution\n------------\n\n``cemu`` was created and maintained by myself,\n```@_hugsy_`` <https://twitter.com/_hugsy_>`__, but kept fresh thanks to\n`all the\ncontributors <https://github.com/hugsy/cemu/graphs/contributors>`__.\n",
