    "description": "ChIP-Seq is widely used to characterize genome-wide binding patterns of transcription factors \nand other chromatin-associated proteins. Although comparison of ChIP-Seq data sets is critical for understanding the \nrole of their cell type-specific binding on modulating gene regulation programs, few quantitative approaches have \nbeen developed. Here, we present a simple and effective method, MAnorm, for quantitative comparison of ChIP-Seq data \nsets describing transcription factor binding sites and epigenetic modifications. The quantitative binding differences \ninferred by MAnorm showed strong correlation with both the changes in expression of target genes and the binding of \ncell type-specific regulators. \n\nMAnorm uses common peaks of two samples as a reference to build the rescaling model for normalization, which is based \non the empirical assumption that if a chromatin-associated protein has a substantial number of peaks shared in two \nconditions, the binding at these common regions will tend to be determined by similar mechanisms, and thus should  \nexhibit similar global binding intensities across samples. \n\nThe normalized M value given by MAnorm was used as a quantitative measure of differential binding in each peak region \nbetween two samples, with peak regions associated with larger absolute M values exhibiting greater binding differences \nbetween two samples.  \n\nMAnorm exhibited excellent performance in quantitative comparison of ChIP-Seq data sets for both epigenetic \nmodifications and transcription factors. The quantitative binding differences inferred by MAnorm were highly \ncorrelated with both the changes in expression of target genes and also the binding of cell type-specific regulators. \nWith the accumulation of ChIP-seq data sets, MAnorm should serve as a powerful tool for obtaining a more \ncomprehensive understanding of cell type-specific and cell state-specific regulation during organism development and \ndisease onset. \n\n**Citation** MAnorm: a robust model for quantitative comparison of ChIP-Seq data sets.
