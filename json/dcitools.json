    "description": "Digital Cinema Server API Library\n=================================\n\nAbout\n-----\n\nThis library attempts to provide a functional and simple python package to manipulate, through their API, different digital cinema servers, players, and theatre management system.\n\nThe only brand actually supported is Doremi (company now bought by Dolby).\n\nCurrent supported machines are :\n - DCP2000\n - DCP-2K4\n - ShowVault\n - IMS1000\n\nComing next: \n - Doremi TMS\n - AAM TMS\n - Unique TMS\n - GDC servers\n - Old Dolby servers\n - Sony ?\n - Qube (someday maybe, haha, I can't wait to code with their API again, it is a bloody joke)\n\nProject url : https://github.com/ronhanson/python-dcitools\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n***Lib Usage***\n\nLibrary is going to be documented in the docs folder.\nBut it is not yet for now... so just look at the code as it is commented for that.\n\n***Script Usage***\n\nScripts have been created in order to use DCP2000 apis directly from command lines.\nThis scripts is named doremi.py and its usage can be found by typing :\n\n   bin/doremiapi --help\n\nThat should be fairly simple.\n\nFor example, to list the CPL on a server :\n\n   bin/doremiapi execute 172.17.10.109 GetCPLList\n\nTo get information about a CPL :\n\n   bin/doremiapi x 172.17.10.109 GetCPLInfo 851cc838-022e-43b7-9fee-18656bdfc995\n\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\n\nThis libraries are used most on Linux and OSX systems, but plenty of functions may work on windows.\n\nThis libraries are compatibles with Python 2.X and Python 3.X.\n\nMainly tested on 2.7 and 3.4.\n\n\nAuthor & Licence\n----------------\n\nCopyright (c) 2007-2015 Ronan Delacroix\n\nThis program is released under MIT Licence.
