It provides a consistent\r\nhigh-level interface for configuring and launching parallel computations\r\nacross heterogenous resources. `pathos` provides configurable launchers for\r\nparallel and distributed computing, where each launcher contains the\r\nsyntactic logic to configure and launch jobs in an execution environment.\r\nExamples of launchers that plug into `pathos` are: a queue-less MPI-based\r\nlauncher (in `pyina`), a ssh-based launcher (in `pathos`), and a multi-process\r\nlauncher (in `multiprocess`).\r\n\r\n`pathos` provides a consistent interface for parallel and/or distributed\r\nversions of `map` and `apply` for each launcher, thus lowering the barrier\r\nfor users to extend their code to parallel and/or distributed resources.\r\nThe guiding design principle behind `pathos` is that `map` and `apply`\r\nshould be drop-in replacements in otherwise serial code, and thus switching\r\nto one or more of the `pathos` launchers is all that is needed to enable\r\ncode to leverage the selected parallel or distributed computing resource.\r\nThis not only greatly reduces the time to convert a code to parallel, but it\r\nalso enables a single code-base to be maintained instead of requiring\r\nparallel, serial, and distributed versions of a code. `pathos` maps can be\r\nnested, thus hierarchical heterogenous computing is possible by merely\r\nselecting the desired hierarchy of `map` and `pipe` (`apply`) objects.\r\n\r\nThe `pathos` framework is composed of several interoperating packages::\r\n\r\n    - dill: a utility to serialize all of python\r\n    - pox: utilities for filesystem exploration and automated builds\r\n    - klepto: persistent caching to memory, disk, or database\r\n    - multiprocess: better multiprocessing and multithreading in python\r\n    - ppft: distributed and parallel python\r\n    - pyina: MPI parallel `map` and cluster scheduling\r\n    - pathos: graph management and execution in heterogenous computing\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Pathos\r\n============\r\n\r\nThe `pathos` package provides a few basic tools to make parallel and\r\ndistributed computing more accessable to the end user. The goal of `pathos`\r\nis to allow the user to extend their own code to parallel and distributed\r\ncomputing with minimal refactoring.\r\n\r\n`pathos` provides methods for configuring, launching, monitoring, and\r\ncontrolling a service on a remote host. One of the most basic features\r\nof `pathos` is the ability to configure and launch a RPC-based service\r\non a remote host. `pathos` seeds the remote host with a small `portpicker`\r\nscript, which allows the remote host to inform the localhost of a port\r\nthat is available for communication.\r\n\r\nBeyond the ability to establish a RPC service, and then post requests,\r\nis the ability to launch code in parallel. Unlike parallel computing\r\nperformed at the node level (typically with MPI), `pathos` enables the\r\nuser to launch jobs in parallel across heterogeneous distributed resources.\r\n`pathos` provides distributed `map` and `pipe` algorithms, where a mix of\r\nlocal processors and distributed workers can be selected.  `pathos`\r\nalso provides a very basic automated load balancing service, as well as\r\nthe ability for the user to directly select the resources.\r\n\r\nThe high-level `pool.map` interface, yields a `map` implementation that\r\nhides the RPC internals from the user. With `pool.map`, the user can launch\r\ntheir code in parallel, and as a distributed service, using standard python\r\nand without writing a line of server or parallel batch code.\r\n\r\nRPC servers and communication in general is known to be insecure.  However,\r\ninstead of attempting to make the RPC communication itself secure, `pathos`\r\nprovides the ability to automatically wrap any distributes service or\r\ncommunication in a ssh-tunnel. Ssh is a universally trusted method.\r\nUsing ssh-tunnels, `pathos` has launched several distributed calculations\r\non national lab clusters, and to date has performed test calculations\r\nthat utilize node-to-node communication between several national lab clusters\r\nand a user's laptop.  `pathos` allows the user to configure and launch\r\nat a very atomistic level, through raw access to ssh and scp. \r\n\r\n`pathos` is the core of a python framework for heterogeneous computing.\r\n`pathos` is in active development, so any user feedback, bug reports, comments,\r\nor suggestions are highly appreciated.  A list of known issues is maintained\r\nat http://trac.mystic.cacr.caltech.edu/project/pathos/query, with a public\r\nticket list at https://github.com/uqfoundation/pathos/issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor Features\r\n==============\r\n\r\n`pathos` provides a configurable distributed parallel `map` interface\r\nto launching RPC service calls, with::\r\n\r\n    - a `map` interface that meets and extends the python `map` standard\r\n    - the ability to submit service requests to a selection of servers\r\n    - the ability to tunnel server communications with ssh\r\n\r\nThe `pathos` core is built on low-level communication to remote hosts using\r\nssh. The interface to ssh, scp, and ssh-tunneled connections can::\r\n\r\n    - configure and launch remote processes with ssh\r\n    - configure and copy file objects with scp\r\n    - establish an tear-down a ssh-tunnel\r\n\r\nTo get up and running quickly, `pathos` also provides infrastructure to::\r\n\r\n    - easily establish a ssh-tunneled connection to a RPC server\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent Release\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThis version is `pathos-0.2.0`.\r\n\r\nThe latest released version of `pathos` is available from::\r\n\r\n    http://trac.mystic.cacr.caltech.edu/project/pathos\r\n\r\n`pathos` is distributed under a 3-clause BSD license.\r\n\r\n    >>> import pathos\r\n    >>> print (pathos.license())\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment Version\r\n===================\r\n\r\nYou can get the latest development version with all the shiny new features at::\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/uqfoundation\r\n\r\nIf you have a new contribution, please submit a pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\n`pathos` is packaged to install from source, so you must\r\ndownload the tarball, unzip, and run the installer::\r\n\r\n    [download]\r\n    $ tar -xvzf pathos-0.2.0.tgz\r\n    $ cd pathos-0.2.0\r\n    $ python setup py build\r\n    $ python setup py install\r\n\r\nYou will be warned of any missing dependencies and/or settings\r\nafter you run the \"build\" step above.  `pathos` depends on `dill` and\r\n`pox`, each of which are essentially subpackages of `pathos` but are\r\nreleased independently. `pathos` also depends on `multiprocess` and\r\n`ppft`.  You must install all of the `pathos` framework packages for\r\n`pathos` to provide the full functionality for heterogeneous computing. \r\n\r\nAlternately, `pathos` can be installed with `pip` or `easy_install`::\r\n\r\n    $ pip install pathos\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n============\r\n\r\n`pathos` requires::\r\n\r\n    - python2, version >= 2.6  *or*  python3, version >= 3.1\r\n    - dill, version >= 0.2.5\r\n    - pox, version >= 0.2.2\r\n    - ppft, version >= 1.6.4.5\r\n    - multiprocess, version >= 0.70.4\r\n\r\nOptional requirements::\r\n\r\n    - setuptools, version >= 0.6\r\n    - pyina, version >= 0.2a.dev0\r\n    - rpyc, version >= 3.0.6\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Information\r\n================\r\n\r\nProbably the best way to get started is to look at the tests and\r\nexamples provided within `pathos`. See `pathos.examples` and `pathos.tests`\r\nfor a set of scripts that demonstrate the configuration and launching of\r\ncommunications with ssh and scp, and demonstrate the configuration and\r\nexecution of jobs in a hierarchical parallel workflow. The source code is\r\nalso generally well documented, so further questions may be resolved by\r\ninspecting the code itself.  Please also feel free to submit a ticket on\r\ngithub, or ask a question on stackoverflow (@Mike McKerns).\r\n\r\n`pathos` is an active research tool. There are a growing number of publications\r\nand presentations that discuss real-world examples and new features of `pathos`\r\nin greater detail than presented in the user's guide.  If you would like to\r\nshare how you use `pathos` in your work, please post a link or send an email\r\n(to mmckerns at uqfoundation dot org).\r\n\r\nImportant classes and functions are found here::\r\n\r\n    - `pathos.abstract_launcher`           [the worker pool API definition]\r\n    - `pathos.pools`                       [all of the pathos worker pools]\r\n    - `pathos.core`                        [the high-level command interface] \r\n    - `pathos.hosts`                       [the hostname registry interface] \r\n    - `pathos.serial.SerialPool`           [the serial python worker pool]\r\n    - `pathos.parallel.ParallelPool`       [the parallelpython worker pool]\r\n    - `pathos.multiprocessing.ProcessPool` [the multiprocessing worker pool]\r\n    - `pathos.threading.ThreadPool`        [the multithreading worker pool]\r\n    - `pathos.connection.Pipe`             [the launcher base class]\r\n    - `pathos.secure.Pipe`                 [the secure launcher base class]\r\n    - `pathos.secure.Copier`               [the secure copier  base class]\r\n    - `pathos.secure.Tunnel`               [the secure tunnel base class]\r\n    - `pathos.selector.Selector`           [the selector base class]\r\n    - `pathos.server.Server`               [the server base class]\r\n    - `pathos.profile`                     [profiling in threads and processes]\r\n\r\n`pathos` also provides four convenience scripts that are used to establish\r\nsecure distributed connections. These scripts are installed to a directory\r\non the user's $PATH, and thus can be run from anywhere::\r\n\r\n    - `portpicker.py`                      [get the portnumber of an open port]\r\n    - `pathos_tunnel.py`                   [establish a ssh-tunnel connection]\r\n    - `pathos_server.py`                   [launch a remote RPC server]\r\n    - `tunneled_pathos_server.py`          [launch a tunneled remote RPC server]\r\n\r\nTyping `--help` as an argument to any of the above three scripts will print\r\nout an instructive help message.\r\n\r\n\r\nCitation\r\n========\r\n\r\nIf you use `pathos` to do research that leads to publication, we ask that you\r\nacknowledge use of `pathos` by citing the following in your publication::\r\n\r\n    M.M.
