    "description": "Weld: Gmail + XMPP\n==================\n\nThe similarity between email addresses and XMPP JIDs is often noted in\nintroductory texts to XMPP, and there have been claims that XMPP can serve as an\nemail replacement (e.g. Google Wave). Weld takes the next step in merging email\nand XMPP systems.\n\nConverting emails into XMPP stanzas is a complex issue due to the various MIME\ntypes, multipart emails, various headers, etc. Weld sidesteps that issue by\nassuming that content is treated the same way in emails as it is in XMPP message\nstanzas: a single, plain text message with an optional subject.\n\nFor example, an email such as::\n\n    From: user@example.com\n    To: weldaddr@example.com\n    Subject: Mapping an email to an XMPP message\n\n    Just some plain text content.\n\nwill be turned into an XMPP message like this::\n\n    <message to=\"welduser@example.com\"\n             from=\"user\\40example.com@weld.example.com\">\n      <subject>Mapping an email to an XMPP message</subject>\n      <body>Just some plain text content.</body>\n    </message>\n\nWeld converts email addresses to valid JIDs by replacing the @ character with\nthe escape sequence `\\\\40` and using Weld's JID as the domain part. For example,\nexample@gmail.com will be turned into example\\\\40gmail.com@weld.example.com.\nMessages sent to these JIDs will be sent as emails.\n\nTo make listening for new emails easier, Weld works with Gmail using Google's\nnew mail notification stanzas. A new XMPP client is created for each email\naddress monitored by Weld to listen for the new message notice. The message\nis then retrieved via IMAP and converted into an XMPP stanza.\n\nBut Wait, There's More!\n-----------------------\nWeld can also work as an SMS gateway by sending and receiving messages from special\nemail addresses from wireless providers (see the `full list`_). For example, Alltel users can send and\nreceive text messages from 5555555555@message.alltel.com. In fact, getting this\nfunctionality was the whole point of creating Weld in the first place.\n\n.. _`full list`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SMS_gateways\n\nDependencies\n------------\nWeld depends on the latest `SleekXMPP beta release <http://github.com/fritzy/SleekXMPP>`_.",
