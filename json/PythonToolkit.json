    "description": "PythonToolkit (PTK) is an interactive environment for python. It was originally designed to provide a python based environment similiar to Matlab for scientists and engineers when used together with the numpy, scipy and matplotlib python packages. However it can also be used as a general purpose interactive python environment especially for interactive gui programming.\r\n\r\nIt is built around a console window and simple python source editor and a Tool plugin system so that extra features and support for python packages can be easily added. \r\n\r\nMain features\r\n\r\n- Console window with support for multiple python interpreters(Engines).\r\n- Engines are external processes so that each engine is completely seperated from the others and the PTK interface.\r\n- Interactively program with different GUI toolkits (wxPython, TkInter, pyGTK, pyQT4 and PySide).\r\n- Builtin python debugger integrated with tools and editor.\r\n- Object auto-completions and calltips.\r\n- Multi-line command editing.\r\n- Command history (previous/next and search for partially typed commands).\r\n- Simple editor for code testing and scripting or everyday work.\r\n- Set, edit and clear debugger breakpoints via the editor.\r\n- A matlab style namespace/workspace browser tool that can be extended to support new types and classes.\r\n- A path manager tool to easily change the current working directory and manage the python search paths.\r\n- A python object inspector tool showing object docstring, code, and values.\r\n- GUI viewers for python data types - more can be easily added!\r\n- Python object importer/exporter system to save and load data easily - new importers/exporters can be added!",
