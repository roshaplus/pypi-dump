    "description": "=====\nAmane\n=====\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nAmane is an instant mailing list manager. Its basic idea has come from\nQuickML (https://github.com/masui/QuickML) but it's not the same.\nQuickML is a common easy-to-use mailing list manager, but Amane has\nbeen developed to manage requests by email. So Amane is a kind of\nticket management system like Redmine.\n\nDifference between QuickML and Amane\n------------------------------------\n\n* Mail destination to create a new mailing list\n\n  * QuickML: the first mail account will be used for further posts.\n  * Amane: it has a specific mail account to create the new one.\n    When a mail received, a new mail account will be created and used.\n\n* On Amane, you can define staff members to register new mailing\n  lists automatically.  They can't be removed via member-removing\n  mails.\n* Amane supports multi-tenancy. Each tenant has a mail account to\n  create mailing lists, subject prefix, staff members, various message\n  templates.\n* On Amane, each post will have a system message as an attachment. It\n  can contain basic mailing-list usage and a list of members.\n\nDifference between Redmine and Amane\n------------------------------------\n\n* Redmine is web-based, but Amane is mail-based.\n* Redmine users can customize ticket status, but Amane users cannot.\n* Redmine users can define importance of tickets, but Amane users\n  cannot.\n* Redmine users can define ticket workflows, but Amane users cannot.\n\n\nHow to use Amane\n================\n\nCreating a new ticket\n  Send a mail to the specific mail address (e.g. ask@example.com \\*1)\n  to create new one. Amane will create a new mailing list with its own\n  mail address (e.g. ml-000001@example.com) and forward the initial\n  mail to members including addresses at To:, Cc: and From: except \\*1.\n\nMaking a new post\n  Send a mail to the mailing list address (e.g. ml-000001@example.com).\n\nRegister new members\n  Send a mail with new addresses as Cc: to the mailing list address.\n\nUnregister members\n  Send a mail with empty Subject: and addresses to be removed as Cc:\n  to the mailing list address.\n\nClosing the ticket\n  Send a mail with \"Subject: close\" to the mailing list address.\n\n\nHow to install Amane\n====================\n\nRun commands below::\n\n    # yum install mongodb-server\n    # pip install amane\n\nHow to configure Amane\n======================\n\nAmane has 2 confiugration files.\n\nAmane confiugration file (/etc/amane/amane.conf)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nA YAML file like below::\n\n    db_name: amane\n    db_url: mongodb://localhost/\n    relay_host: localhost\n    relay_port: 25\n    listen_address: 192.168.0.1\n    listen_port: 25\n    log_file: /var/log/amane.log\n    domain: example.com\n\n* db_url, db_name ... URI and DB name of MongoDB\n* relay_host, relay_port ... IP address and port number of the\n  external SMTP server (relay host) for sending posts\n* listen_address, listen_port ...IP address and port number that\n  amane_smptd will listen\n* log_file ...
