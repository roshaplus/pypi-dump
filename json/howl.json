    "description": "howl 1.0\n==========\n\nhowl is a silent agent that monitors RSS or Atom feeds and posts an update on associated Twitter accounts. howl requires you to pair Twitter API access keys and the source RSS feed URL and it periodically posts updates from your RSS feed to Twitter.\n\n* Clips the title text to available amount of characters per Tweet\n* Optionally shortens URLs for the Tweet (using [Google's URL shortener](https://developers.google.com/url-shortener/))\n* Adds location information if provided by your syndication\n* Is able to start posting from a nominated date (since you might have been manually doing this anyway, or have used another service in the past)\n* Ensures that only ever one instance of howl is running on the system; prevents for overlapping calls to the utility when if you choose to use a scheduler like cron\n\nHerlad is easiest installed via `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/howl-twitter/>`_.\n\nGetting Help\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nFor most general discussion, setup and configuration issues please use our `mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/howl-discuss>`_.\n\nIf you're reasonable sure that you've found a bug, please use the `Issue Tracker on Github <https://github.com/anomaly/howl/issues>`_, we use it to triage feature requests, bug reports.\n\nWe are on `Twitter <https://twitter.com/anomalymade/>`_ or optionally check out our `web site <https://anomaly.net.au/contact>`_ for additional contact  information.",
