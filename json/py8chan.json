    "description": "8chan/vichan Python Library\r\n===========================\r\nThe Bibliotheca Anonoma's **complete Python Wrapper for the 8chan API.**\r\nUses requests, respects if-modified-since headers on updating threads.\r\nCaches thread objects. Fun stuff.\r\n\r\nAn absolute must if you want to interface with or scrape from 8chan or other vichan-based imageboards/textboards,\r\nusing a Python script._\r\n\r\n`Github Repository <https://github.com/bibanon/BASC-py4chan>`_\r\n\r\nYou can install this library `straight from\r\nPyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py8chan>`_ with::\r\n\r\n    pip install py8chan\r\n\r\n\r\n**Getting Help**\r\n\r\nIf you want help, or you have some trouble using this library, our primary IRC channel\r\nis `#bibanon on irc.rizon.net <http://qchat2.rizon.net/?channels=bibanon>`_. Simply head\r\nin there and talk to dan or antonizoon. Otherwise, you can put a issue on our `Github\r\nIssue Tracker <https://github.com/bibanon/py8chan>`_ and we'll respond as soon as\r\nwe can!\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n.. code:: python\r\n\r\n    import py8chan\r\n    b = py8chan.Board('b')\r\n    thread = b.get_thread(423491034)\r\n\r\n    print(thread)\r\n\r\n    # supports displaying extra files in one post as well!\r\n    for file in thread.all_files():\r\n        print(file.file_url)\r\n        \r\n    # In a while...\r\n    print(\"I fetched\", thread.update(), \"new replies.\")\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThis library extends the classes of `BASC-py4chan <https://github.com/bibanon/BASC-py4chan>`_. For the most part, it inherits all functions and remains compatible. See the BASC-py4chan documentation for more info.\r\n\r\n`BASC-py4chan Documentation <http://basc-py4chan.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_\r\n\r\nNotice that some functions are not implemented in the 8chan API.
