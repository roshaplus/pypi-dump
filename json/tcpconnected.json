    "description": "TCP Connected for Python\n========================\n\nAn interface library for Python that connects to and controls TCP Connected\nbranded lighting through its unofficial and community documented API. This\nlibrary is designed to be used as middleware for projects such as home\nautomation systems.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n - Turn on/off lights connected to gateway\n - Turn on/off rooms connected to gateway\n - Change intensity of lights connected to gateway\n - Change intensity of rooms connected to gateway\n\nWhile this library is able to monitor and control lights connected to a TCP\nConnected gateway, it is not yet able to generate its own app token. To do\nthis, you must use another app or library such as stockmopar's Connected by\nTCP Node.js library to generate a token.\n\n\n",
