    "description": "======\nPicire\n======\n*Parallel Delta Debugging Framework*\n\n.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/picire.svg\n   :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/picire\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/renatahodovan/picire.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/renatahodovan/picire\n\nPicire (pronounced as /pitsirE/) is a Python 3 implementation of the\n`Delta Debugging`_ algorithm supporting parallelization and further\nconfiguration options. It can be used either as a command line tool\nor as a library.\n\nJust like the original algorithm, *picire* automatically reduces \"interesting\"\ntests while keeping their \"interesting\" behaviour. A common use case is\nminimizing failing tests so that they still reproduce the original failure.\n\nThe tool (and the algorithm) works iteratively. As a first step, it splits up\nthe input into *n* chunks either by lines or characters. Then, iteratively,\nit inspects smaller test cases composed of these chunks whether they are still\ninteresting. The selection of chunks can happen two ways: either a small subset\nof the chunks is kept (subset-based reduce), or that small subset is removed\nand everything else is kept (complement-based reduce). If a new interesting\ntest case is found, it becomes the input of the next iteration. The iterations\nstop if removing any further chunks would make the test uninteresting (e.g. the\ntest is **1-minimal**).\n\n.. _`Delta Debugging`: https://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/dd/\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n* Python_ >= 3.4\n* pip_ and setuptools Python packages (the latter is automatically installed by\n  pip).\n\n.. _Python: https://www.python.org\n.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io\n\n\nInstall\n=======\n\nThe quick way::\n\n    pip install picire\n\nAlternatively, by cloning the project and running setuptools::\n\n    python setup.py install\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n*picire* has two mandatory command line arguments: one that defines the input\ntest case to be reduced (``--input``) and another describing an executable\ntester script or program (``--test``) that can decide about the interestingness\nof an arbitrary input. This will be run in every iteration to check a test case.\n\nCommon settings\n---------------\n\n* ``--parallel``: Enables *picire* to run in multiprocess mode. (Otherwise, the\n  original single-process variant will run.)\n\n* ``-j <num>``: Defines the maximum number of parallel jobs.\n\n* ``--combine-loops``: The base algorithm had a dependency between subset and\n  complement-based reduce loops, but because of the sequential nature of its\n  implementation, it had no effect on efficiency. However, in parallel mode,\n  this separation becomes a potential sub-optimality. With this option, the\n  two reduce loops run combined for additional performance. Further details\n  about the algorithm variants are available in the cited papers.\n\n* ``--complement-first``: For some input types, subset-based reduce is not as\n  effective as the complement-based one (sometimes, aggressively removing too\n  big parts of the input eliminates the interestingness as well). By default,\n  *picire* performs subset-based reduce before complement-based reduce, which\n  can result in many superfluous checks for such inputs. This flag forces to\n  start with complement checks.\n\n* ``--subset-iterator`` / ``--complement-iterator``: Guide the iteration\n  strategies of the subset and complement-based reduce loops.\n\n  * ``forward``: Start investigating subsets (or complements) from the beginning\n    of the input.\n\n  * ``backward``: Start investigating subsets (or complements) from the end of\n    the input. The goal is to reduce the number of semantic violations\n    (assuming that definitions - like variable declarations - appear before\n    uses).\n\n  * ``skip``: Completely avoids the subset or complement checks (mostly used\n    with ``--subset-iterator``).\n\nFor the detailed options, see ``picire --help``.\n\nTester script\n-------------\n\nThe tester script is expected to take one command line argument, the path of a\ntest case, and it has to exit with 0 if the test is interesting and with\nnon-zero otherwise. An example tester script that runs an arbitrary target\napplication and checks if it fails on an assertion might look like the one\nbelow::\n\n    #! /bin/bash\n    timeout --foreground 10 <path/to/the/target/application> $1 2>&1 | grep -q \"Assertion failed\";\n\n**Remarks:**\n\n* ``$1`` is the single and mandatory command line argument containing the path\n  of a test case.\n* If the target application is not guaranteed to exit, then it's worth running\n  it with ``timeout`` to limit the amount of time waiting for producing the\n  expected behaviour.\n* If the target is run with timeout then the ``--foreground`` flag can also be\n  useful as it allows forwarding the ``KILL`` signals (used by the parallel\n  implementation) through the timeout's process group. This enables us to\n  stop all alive parallel processes when a new interesting configuration\n  is found already.\n* If the interestingness decision is based on the content of the output then\n  using ``grep`` (perhaps with ``-q`` or ``--quiet``) might be a right choice,\n  since it returns 0 if the pattern was found and 1 if not. Exactly the\n  return value *picire* expects.\n\nA common form of *picire*'s usage::\n\n    picire --input=<path/to/the/input> --test=<path/to/the/tester> \\\n    --parallel --subset-iterator=skip --complement-iterator=backward\n\n\nCompatibility\n=============\n\n*picire* was tested on:\n\n* Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 / 15.10)\n* Mac OS X (OS X El Capitan - 10.11).\n\n\nAcknowledgement and Citations\n=============================\n\nThis software uses the delta debugging algorithm as described in (A.
