    "description": "What\n=====\n\nThis is a decorator for a django view that will request Basic Authentication.\nThis is a copy of https://djangosnippets.org/snippets/243/\n\nWhy\n====\n\nThere are serveral reasons for this Package:\n\n  * I wanted Basic Authentication for just a couple of views. So the RemoteUserAuthBackend was no option. Also I did not want to configure the webserver to do Basic Authentication.\n  * As you can read in the comments of https://djangosnippets.org/snippets/243/ there are some bugs in it - so I wanted to have them fixed - but also documented that they were fixed and in the end provide a fixed version of it\n  * Also I just want to install it via pip\n\nHow to use\n===========\n\nApache\n-------\n\nAdd this to your apache config to tell apache to pass the Authorication Headers to your application:\n\n  WSGIPassAuthorization On",
