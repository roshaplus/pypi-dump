    "description": "A sample Python project\n\nA sample project that exists as an aid to the Python Packaging User Guide's Tutorial on Packaging and Distributing Projects.\n\nThis projects does not aim to cover best practices for Python project development as a whole. For example, it does not provide guidance or tool recommendations for version control, documentation, or testing.\n\nThis is the README file for the project.\n\nThe file should use UTF-8 encoding and be written using reStructuredText. It will be used to generate the project webpage on PyPI and will be displayed as the project homepage on common code-hosting services, and should be written for that purpose.\n\nTypical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not a good idea, although a simple \"What's New\" section for the most recent version may be appropriate.",
