    "description": "python-gsmmodem is a module that allows easy control of a GSM modem attached\nto the system. It also includes a couple of useful commandline utilities for\ninteracting with a GSM modem.\n\nIts features include:\n- simple methods for sending SMS messages, checking signal level, etc\n- easy-to-use API for starting and responding to USSD sessions and making voice calls\n- handling incoming phone calls and received SMS messages via callback methods\n- support for SMS PDU and text mode\n- support for tracking SMS status reports\n- wraps AT command errors into Python exceptions by default\n- modular design; you easily issue your own AT commands to the modem with error\n  (with error checking), or read/write directly from/to the modem if you prefer\n- comprehensive test suite\n\nBundled utilities:\n- GSMTerm: an easy-to-use serial terminal for communicating with an attached GSM\n  modem. It features command completion, built-in help for many AT commands,\n  history, context-aware prompt, etc.\n- sendsms.py: a simple command line script to send SMS messages\n- identify-modem.py: simple utility to identify attached modem. Can also be used to\n  provide debug information used for development of python-gsmmodem.",
