We recommend creating a\n[virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) (or\n`pipenv`) to install the dependencies.\n\n## From Pypi\n\n```sh\n$ pip install whotracksme\n```\n\n## From source\n\n```sh\n$ pip install -e .\n```\n\nThat's all you need to get started!\n\n# Using the data\n\nTo get started with the data, everything you need can be found in\n`whotracksme.data`:\n\n```python\nfrom whotracksme.data import (\n    load_apps,\n    load_companies,\n    load_overview,\n    load_sites,\n    load_tracker_db,\n)\n\nprint(load_apps())\n```\n\nFor more examples of scripts, have a look in the [contrib](./contrib) folder!\n\n# Building the site\n\nBuilding the site requires a few extra dependencies, not installed by default to\nnot make the installation heavier than it needs to be. You will need to install\n`whotracksme` this way:\n\n```sh\n$ pip install 'whotracksme[website]'\n```\n\nOr if you do it from source:\n```sh\n$ pip install -e '.[website]'\n```\n\n*Furthermore* you also need to [install sass](http://sass-lang.com/install).\n\n\nOnce this is done, you will have access to a `whotracksme` entry point that can\nbe used this way:\n\n```sh\n$ whotracksme website [serve]\n```\n\nThe `serve` part is optional and can be used while making changes on the\nwebsite.\n\nAll generated artifacts can be found in the `_site/` folder.\n\n## Tests\n\nTo run tests, you will need `pytest`, or simply install `whotacksme` with the\n`test` extra:\n\n```sh\n$ pip install -e '.[test,website]'\n$ pytest\n```\n\n# Contributing\n\nWe are happy to take contributions on:\n* guest articles for our blog in the topics of tracking, privacy and security. Feel free to use the data in this repository if you need inspiration.\n* Curating our database of tracker profiles.\n\n\n# License\n\nThe content of this project itself is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), and the underlying\nsource code used to generate and display that content is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/whotracks.me/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\n",
