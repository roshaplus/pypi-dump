Go to *Website Admin > Configuration > Settings* and choose or create\n    a *Website*.\n#. Press *Advanced > Multiwebsite theme > Reload*.\n#. In *Advanced > Multiwebsite theme*, pick one of the available themes.\n\nOnce you save, any website that has no *Multiwebsite theme* selected will have,\nthe default plain Bootstrap theme, and those that do have one will get it.\n\nOf course, your Odoo instance must be reachable by all of the provided host\nnames, or nobody will ever see the effect. But that is most likely configured\nthrough your DNS provider and/or proxy, so it is not a matter of this addon.\n\nIf you want to test this behavior, think that ``localhost`` and ``127.0.0.1``\nare different host names.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo use this module, you need to:\n\n#. Follow the configuration steps.\n#. Enter any of the websites you modified.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/186/10.0\n\nDevelopment FAQ\n===============\n\nHow to develop a multiwebsite-ready theme?\n------------------------------------------\n\nCheck ``demo/themes.xml``. It includes a demo theme that will serve as a\ntemplate for you. This demo theme turns primary buttons green, so you can test\nif it is applied or not easily.\n\nHow to convert a single-website theme in a multi-website one?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCheck ``data/themes_bootswatch.xml``. You must do that. You can consider adding\nthe support directly in this addon, given it will just do nothing if the\nsingle-website theme addon is not installed (it acts as a soft dependency).\n\nHow to get multiwebsite-specific views updated?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThis addon is conservative by default, meaning that in production databases\nviews will not be updated if they already were created (except for the ones\ncopied from ``templates/patterns.xml``).\n\nTo force your website getting updated views for all views from a base theme\nthat has changed, you should disable the website multi theme (to make the\nengine remove all views) and then re-enable it again (to recreate them from\nscratch).\n\nThis does not happen in demo or development instances, where views arch is\nalways updated.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* Private themes support is not guaranteed.\n* There is no UI to remove websites. Do it through an odoo shell.\n* Theme picker should include some kind of thumbnail if possible.\n* If you install any of the supported themes after installing this addon, you\n  will have to press *Reload* in the website config wizard to make it notice\n  the change.\n* If you install any unsupported theme along with this addon, it would possibly\n  become the base for all those supported, which can easily lead to weird\n  situations and errors.\n* This addon will not work if your Odoo is not patched. Make sure it is updated\n  before installing.
