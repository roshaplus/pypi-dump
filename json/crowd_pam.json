    "description": "crowd_pam.py\r\n=============\r\n\r\nGiven an Atlassian Crowd server with either its internal user database \r\nor some other backend user management system (e.g. LDAP), this utility \r\nmakes it possible to establish a single-sign-on environment for Linux \r\nsystems whereby users can log into Linux systems with the same password\r\n they use against other Crowd backed systems.\r\n\r\nWhen a user attempts to log into a Linux system running crowd_pam.py,\r\nthe username is verified against Crowd and if the user exists in Crowd, \r\na corresponding local Linux user account will be created.  Then if the \r\nuser's username and password pass authentication, the user will be \r\nallowed to sign into the system.\r\n\r\nIf the user is a member of groups in Crowd that do not exist on the \r\nlocal Linux machine, crowd_pam.py will create the groups on the local \r\nLinux system.  If a user is removed from a group membership on Crowd, \r\nhe/she will be removed from the user group on the local Linux system.",
