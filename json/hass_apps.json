    "description": "hass-apps\n=========\n\nSome useful apps and snippets to empower Home Assistant and AppDaemon\neven more.\n\n\nApps\n----\n\nAll apps for AppDaemon can be found inside the ``hass_apps`` directory\nof this repository. Each includes a sample configuration in the file\n``doc/apps.yaml.example``.\n\nCurrently, the following apps are included:\n\n* `heaty`_:  A highly-configurable, comfortable to use Home Assistant /\n  appdaemon app that controls thermostats based on a schedule while still\n  facilitating manual intervention at any time.\n* **motion_light**:  This app can turn devices on/off according to the\n  state of sensors.\n  The most obvious use case is controlling lights when motion sensors\n  report motion, but other scenarios are imaginable as well. Delays and\n  constraints can be configured freely for each individual sensor.\n\n.. _heaty: hass_apps/heaty/doc/README.rst\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nIn order to use one or more of the apps provided here, please install\nthe whole ``hass_apps`` package. Don't worry, only the apps you configure\nwill be loaded.\n\nInstall from PyPi:\n\n::\n\n    pip3 install hass-apps\n\nOr clone the GitHub repository to get even the latest changes:\n\n::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/efficiosoft/hass-apps\n    cd hass-apps\n    pip3 install . --upgrade\n\n\nA note for hass.io users\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAs far as I know, it's not possible to create a plug & play add-on for\nhass.io containing hass-apps, because it needs to be installed into\nAppDaemon's container.\n\nEven though it's untested, the only actions needed in order to install\nunder hass.io should be:\n\n1. Install the appdaemon add-on.\n2. Copy the ``hass_apps`` folder and the file ``hass_apps_loader.py`` into\n   the ``apps`` directory of your AppDaemon container. This is also the\n   only thing you need to do when upgrading to a newer version of hass-apps.\n3. Continue with the configuration as normal.\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\n1. Get yourself a nice cup of coffee or tea. You'll surely need it.\n2. Copy the file ``hass_apps_loader.py`` to your AppDaemon's ``apps``\n   directory. This is just a stub that imports the real app's code.\n3. Pick one or more apps you want to use.\n4. Copy the contents of ``hass_apps/some_app/doc/apps.yaml.example``\n   to your ``apps.yaml`` file and adapt it as necessary. The example\n   files also contain documentation comments explaining what the\n   different settings mean.\n5. AppDaemon should have noticed the changes made to ``apps.yaml`` and\n   restart its apps automatically.\n\nYou're done!\n\n\nUpgrade\n-------\n\nSimply pull upgrades from PyPi:\n\n::\n\n    pip3 install --upgrade hass-apps\n\nOr, if you installed from the git repository:\n\n::\n\n    cd /path/to/your/clone/of/the/repository\n    git pull\n    pip3 install . --upgrade\n\nNote that AppDaemon doesn't detect changes in the imported modules\nautomatically and needs to be restarted manually after an upgrade.\n",
