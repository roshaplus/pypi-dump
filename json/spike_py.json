    "description": "README\n======\n\nThis is the beta version of the **SPIKE** program. A collaborative\ndevelopment for a FT-spectroscopy processing program.\n\nWhat is SPIKE ?\n---------------\n\n**SPIKE** is a program that allows the processing, the display and the\nanalysis of data-sets obtained from various Fourier-Transform\nspectroscopies.\n\n**SPIKE** stands for **S**\\ pectrometry **P**\\ rocessing\n**I**\\ nnovative **KE**\\ rnel.\n\nIt allows the processing of **1D** and **2D** FT spectroscopies,\nimplementing Real, Complex and HyperComplex n-dimensionnal Fourier\nTransform, as well as many other functionalities.\n\nTo our knowledge, it is the first program freely available allowing the\nprocessing, display and analysis of 2D-FT-ICR.\n\nIt is still in very active development, and distributed here as an alpha\nversion. Many features are missing, and many other while present, are\nnot fully fixed. However, considering the amount of effort already\npresent in this code, we decided to make it available. We believe that\neven in this partial development stage, this program might prove useful\nfor certain usages.\n\n-  For the moment, SPIKE handles the following Spectroscopies\n\n   -  **NMR** - 1D and 2D are fully supported\n   -  **FT-ICR** - 1D and 2D are fully supported\n   -  **Orbitrap** - 1D only (!)\n   -  *other spectroscopies are being considered*\n   -  Files can be imported from\n\n      -  NMR : Bruker topspin / NPK (NMRNoteBook) program\n      -  FT-ICR : Bruker Apex\n      -  Orbitrap : Thermofisher raw data\n      -  any data in memory in a ``numpy`` buffer.\n\nSPIKE allows to process datasets interactively from an ipython prompt,\nand is perfectly working in ``IPython Notebook`` .\n\n-  Look at the examples files ( ``eg_*.py`` ) for examples and some\n   documentation.\n-  display is performed using the ``matplotlib`` library.\n-  large 2D-FT-ICR are handles in batch using the ``processing.py``\n   batch program, controlled by parameter files called ``*.mscf``\n-  The batch mode supports multiprocessing, both with MPI and natively\n   on multi-core machines (still in-progress)\n-  large 2D-FT-ICR are stored in a hierarchical format, easyly displayed\n   with an interactive program.\n-  data-sets are handled in the HDF5 standard file-format, which allows\n   virtually unlimited file size ( *tested up to 200 Gb* ).\n-  Version : this is 0.6 beta version\n\nA more complete documentation is available\n`here <https://spikydoc.bitbucket.org>`__.\n\nHow do I get SPIKE ?\n--------------------\n\nSPIKE is written in pure python 2.7, and relies on several external\nlibraries.\n\nIt requires the following non-standard python libraries :\n\n-  `numpy <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/>`__\n-  `scipy <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/>`__\n-  `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/contents.html>`__\n-  Qt / `PySide <http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide>`__\n-  HDF5 / `Pytables <http://www.pytables.org/moin>`__\n-  MPI / `mpi4py <http://www.mpi4py.scipy.org/>`__\n\nIt has been successfully tested in the\n`**Enthought** <https://enthought.com/>`__ and\n`**anaconda** <http://continuum.io/>`__ distributions.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n**SPIKE** is originated from the \\*\\* *Gifa* \\*\\* program, developed by\nM-A Delsuc and others in ``FORTRAN 77`` since the late eighties. *Gifa*\nhas known several mutations, and finally ended as a partial rewrite\ncalled **NPK**. `NPK <http://abcis.cbs.cnrs.fr/NPK/>`__ program is based\non some of the original ``FORTRAN`` code, wrapped in Java and python,\nwhich allows to control all the program possibilities from the python\nlevel. NPK is a pure computing kernel, with no graphical possibilities,\nand has been used as a kernel embedded in the commercial program\nNMRNoteBook, commercialized by NMRTEC.\n\nHowever, NPK was showing many weaknesses, mostly due to the 32bits\norganization, and a poor file format. So, when a strong scientific\nenvironment became available in python, a rewrite in pure python was\nundertaken. To this initial project, called NPK-V2, many new\nfunctionalities were added, and mostly the capability to work in other\nspectroscopies than NMR.\n\nAt some point, we chose to fork NPK-V2 to SPIKE, and make it public.\n\nCiting SPIKE\n------------\n\nSPIKE is not published yet, if you happen to use it successfully and\nwish to cite it, please refer to this site, as well as the following\nreferences :\n\n1. ::\n\n       Tramesel, D., Catherinot, V. & Delsuc, M.-A.

This set-up\nis temporary.\n\nMany programs contain routines tests (in an object unittest) that also\nserve as an example of use. The code goes through extensive tests daily,\nusing the ``unittest`` python library. However, many tests rely on a set\nof tests data-sets which is more than 1Go large, and not distributed\nhere.\n\nMain programs :\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\na small description of the files: - NPKData.py the main library, allows\nall processing for NMR experiments (1D, 2D and 3D) to be used as a\nlibrary, in a stand-alone program or in ipython interactive session -\nFTICR.py an extension of NPKData for processing FT-ICR datasets (1D and\n2D) - Orbitrap.py an extension of NPKData for processing Orbitrap\ndatasets (1D)\n\n-  processing.py a stand alone program, written on the top of FTICR.py,\n   allowing the efficient processing of FT-ICR 2D datasets, with no\n   limit on the size of the final file Produces multi-resolution files\n   syntax : python processing.py param\\_file.mscf\n-  visu2D.py an interactive tool for visualizing 2D FT-ICR\n   multi-resolution files python visu2D.py param\\_file.mscf\n\nDirectories\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  Algo contains algorithms to process data-sets (MaxEnt, Laplace,\n   etc...) not everything active !\n-  Display a small utility to choose either for regular matplotlib\n   display of fake no-effect display (for tests)\n-  File Importers for various file format for spectrometry, as well as\n   the HDF5 SPIKE native format.\n-  Miscellaneous \"en vrac\"\n-  Visu utilities for the Visu2D program\n-  util set of low-level tools used all over in the code\n-  v1 a library implementing a partial compatibility with the NPKV\\_V1\n   program\n-  SPIKE\\_usage\\_eg example python programs using the various library\n   available\n-  example of configuration files\n\n   -  process\\_eg.mscf\n   -  test.mscf\n\n-  and various utilities\n\n   -  NPKConfigParser.py reads .mscf files\n   -  NPKError.py generates error msg\n   -  QC.py Quality Check\n   -  Tests.py runs all tests\n   -  dev\\_setup.py rolls a new version\n   -  version.py defines version number\n   -  **init**.py defines library\n   -  rcpylint\n   -  To\\_Do\\_list.txt\n   -  QC.txt\n   -  Release.txt\n\nAuthors and Licence\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nActive authors for SPIKE are :\n\n-  Marc-Andr\u00e9 Delsuc . ``madelsuc -at- unistra.fr``\n-  Lionel Chiron . ``Lionel.Chiron -at- casc4de.eu``\n-  Marie-Aude Coutouly . ``Marie-Aude.Coutouly -at- nmrtec.com``\n\nCovered code is provided under this license on an \"as is\" basis, without\nwarranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without\nlimitation, warranties that the covered code is free of defects.
