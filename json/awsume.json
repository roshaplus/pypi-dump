    "description": "AWSume: AWS Assume Made Awesome\n===============================\n\nUtility for easily assuming AWS IAM roles from the command line, now in\nPython!\n\nWhat is AWSume?\n---------------\n\nAWSume is a cross-platform (Mac, Linux, Windows) command-line tool that\nmakes assuming AWS roles and setting user credentials from the AWS CLI\neasy! It works by scanning your ``.aws/config`` and ``.aws/credentials``\nfiles for the profile you give it, making AWS calls to get that\nprofile's credentials, and exporting those credentials to your shell's\nenvironment variables. Then, any AWS CLI calls you make in that shell\nwill be under the profile you gave AWSume.\n\nNow, AWSume comes with a built-in auto-refresher! AWS role credentials\nare only valid for an hour max, and once that hour is up, you need to\nrefresh those credentials, either by calling AWSume again, or doing it\nyourself. Now, AWSume has the ability to spawn a background process that\nwaits for your role credentials to expire, and auto-refreshes them for\nyou, that is, for as long as the role's source profile is valid. And\nwhen you're done working with that role and you'd like to stop that\nbackground process from refreshing those role credentials, simply pass\nthe ``-k`` flag with the profile you gave it to AWSume. If you're done\nworking with all auto-refreshed roles entirely, you can just call\n``awsume -k`` without a profile to kill the background process and\nremove those role credentials.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nPip Installation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAWSume has been conveniently wrapped into a Python package and\ninstallable with just one simple command:\n\n``pip install awsume``\n\nThis will install AWSume from from the Python Package Index. The\ninstaller places the python and shell scripts into your python\ndirectory. If you're using ``Bash`` or ``Zsh``, the installer will add\nan alias definition to their resource control file, either\n``.bash_alias``, ``.bashrc``, ``.bash_profile``, or ``.zshrc``. When\nuninstalling AWSume, the alias definition will not be removed.\n\nOnce you have AWSume installed, you're ready to set up AWSume!\n\nNOTES\n^^^^^\n\n-  You must have Python and Pip installed in order to use AWSume. Get\n   them `here <https://www.python.org>`__.\n-  Make sure your Python PATH environment variables are set.\n-  For Linux / macOS users, restart your terminal after installing to\n   ensure the alias to AWSume is active.\n- For macOS users, you may have to run pip with the\n  ``--ignore-installed six`` option. Try installing without it first.\n  If it doesn't work, try adding the option to the end of the command.\n\nSetup\n-----\n\nConfiguring Using The AWS CLI\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n``aws configure set <key> <value> --profile <profile_name>``\n\nWhere:\n\n-  ``key`` is what you would like to set within the\n   ``config``/``credentials`` file, such as:\n-  ``aws_access_key_id``, ``aws_secret_access_key``, ``region``,\n   ``output``, ``mfa_serial``, ``role_arn``, or ``source_profile``\n-  ``value`` is the value you'd like to set the ``key`` to\n-  ``profile_name`` is the name of the profile you are creating\n-  ``profile_name`` is what you will pass into AWSume\n\nConfiguring Manually\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAdd profiles to\n\n``~/.aws/config`` (for macOS / Linux)\n\n``%userprofile%\\.aws\\config`` (for Windows)\n\nAdd source profiles to\n\n``~/.aws/credentials`` (for macOS / Linux)\n\n``%userprofile%\\.aws\\credentials`` (for Windows)\n\n~/.aws/config\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n::\n\n    [default]\n    region = us-east-1\n    [profile internal-admin]\n    role_arn = arn:aws:iam::<your aws account id>/role/admin-role\n    source_profile = joel\n    region = us-east-1\n    [profile client1-admin]\n    role_arn = arn:aws:iam::<client #1 account id>/role/admin-role\n    mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::<your aws account id>:mfa/joel\n    source_profile = joel\n    region = us-west-2\n    [profile client2-admin]\n    role_arn = arn:aws:iam::<client #2 account id>/role/admin-role\n    mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::<your aws account id>:mfa/joel\n    source_profile = joel\n    region = us-east-1\n\nAdd credentials to\n\n``~/.aws/credentials`` (for macOS / Linux)\n\n``%userprofile%\\.aws\\credentials`` (for Windows)\n\n~/.aws/credentials\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n::\n\n    [default]\n    aws_access_key_id = AKIAIOIEUFSN9EXAMPLE\n    aws_secret_access_key = wJalrXIneUATF/K7MDENG/jeuFHEnfEXAMPLEKEY\n    [joel]\n    aws_access_key_id = AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\n    aws_secret_access_key = wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY\n\nUsage:\n------\n\n::\n\n    usage: awsumepy [-h] [-d] [-s] [-r] [-a] [-k] [-v] [-l] [profile name]\n\n    AWSume\n\n    positional arguments:\n    profile name  The profile name\n\n    optional arguments:\n    -h, --help    show this help message and exit\n    -d            Use the default profile\n    -s            Show the commands to assume the role\n    -r            Force refresh the session\n    -a            Enable auto-refreshing role credentials\n    -k            Kill the auto-refreshing process\n    -v            Display the current version of AWSume\n    -l            List useful information about available \n\nAutoAwsume\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAutoAwsume is a new feature that brings in the ability to auto-refresh\nyour role credentials, so that you don't have to worry about refreshing\nthem yourself every hour. Lets say you want to work under your\n``client-admin`` role, whose source profile is ``client-source``. If you\nwant to AWSume ``client-admin`` credentials, but want them to be\nauto-refreshed when they expire, simply call ``awsume client-admin -a``.\n\nThen, AWSume will add an ``auto-refresh-client-admin`` profile to your\n``.aws/credentials`` file, and export that profile to your environment's\n``AWS_PROFILE`` and ``AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE`` variables. Then, any AWS\ncalls you make will be under that profile.\n\nNow, while that is happening, AWSume spawned a background process,\n``autoAwsume``, that scanns through all profiles listed in your\n``.aws/credentials`` file, and finds any that are prefixed with\n``auto-refresh-``. (In this case, it'd find a profile named\n``auto-refresh-client-admin``) AutoAwsume finds the credentials that\nwill expire the soonest (whether that be the role's source profile\ncredentials or the role credentials themselves) and waits for that\nmoment before it runs again to refresh it.\n\nWhen you're ready to stop working on that profile, simply call\n``awsume client-admin -k`` to remove the ``auto-refresh-client-admin``\nprofile from your ``.aws/credentials`` file. If there are no more\n``auto-refresh-`` profiles remaining in your ``.aws/credentials`` file,\nautoAwsume will stop running. If you'd like to stop autoAwsume entirely\nand remove all ``auto-refresh-`` profiles from the ``.aws/credentials``\nfile completely, simply call ``awsume -k``.\n\nNOTES\n^^^^^\n\n-  Do not kill the autoAwsume process yourself, only kill it through the\n   ``awsume [profile] -k`` command.\n-  When working with autoAwsume on Windows, if you're using Command\n   Prompt, autoAwsume will appear as a minimized window. Only shut it\n   down with the ``awsume [profile] -k`` command.\n-  When working on Windows, use the same shell to shut autoAwsume down\n   that you used to start it up. Do not try to close the autoAwsume\n   process with PowerShell if it has been started with Command Prompt,\n   and vise versa.\n-  AutoAwsume works using the ``AWS_PROFILE`` and\n   ``AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE`` environment variables that point to a\n   specific profile in your ``.aws/credentials`` file, so when that\n   profiles' source profile credentials expire (They usually last around\n   12 hours), you may get an error telling you that\n   ``The config profile ([profile]) could not be found``. If this\n   happens just call AWSume again to continue working.\n\nExamples:\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n``awsume client1-source-profile`` Exports ``client1-source-profile``\ncredentials into current shell, will ask for MFA if needed\n\n``awsume client1-source-profile -n`` Exports ``client1-source-profile``\ncredentials into current shell, will usually not ask for MFA, but it\nwill if ``client1-source-profile`` is a role profile instead of a source\nprofile, and requires MFA\n\n``awsume client1-admin`` Exports ``client1-admin`` credentials into\ncurrent shell, will ask for MFA if needed\n\n``awsume`` Exports the default profile's credentials into current shell,\nwill ask for MFA if needed\n\n``awsume -d`` Exports the default profile's credentials into current\nshell, will ask for MFA if needed\n\n``awsume client1-admin -s`` Outputs export commands to shell, useful if\nyou want to copy / paste into some other shell, will ask for MFA if\nneeded\n\n``awsume client1-admin -r`` Delete cached credentials and refresh, will\nalways prompt for MFA.\n\n``awsume client1-admin -a`` Exports auto-refresh profile to shell's\n``AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE`` and ``AWS_PROFILE`` environment variables,\ncreates a profile in the ``.aws/credentials`` file called\n``auto-refresh-client1-admin`` that contains profile's role credentials,\nand spawns a background process to auto-refresh those role credentials\nwhen they expire, for as long as the role's source profile is valid.\n\n``awsume client1-admin -k`` Removes the ``auto-refresh-client1-admin``\nprofile from the ``.aws/credentials`` file. If no more ``auto-refresh-``\nprofiles are left in the ``.aws/credentials`` file, the auto-refreshing\nbackground process will be killed.\n\n``awsume -k`` Removes all ``auto-refresh-`` profiles from the\n``.aws/credentials`` file, and kills the auto-refreshing background\nprocess.\n\nNOTES\n^^^^^\n\n-  Only use the ``awsume [profile] -k`` option to stop the background\n   process, do not run a ``kill`` command or terminate the process\n   yourself without AWSume.\n\nSee our\n`blog <https://www.trek10.com/blog/awsume-aws-assume-made-awesome>`__\nfor more details.\n",
