    "description": "ECS Deploy\n==========\nAn opinionated deployment application for ECS services.\n\nThe stages of the deployment pipeline are:\n\n- test - The test environment represents the state of master in a git repository\n    or the ``latest`` tag for a Docker image.\n- stage - The stage environment represents a tag in a git repository or a tagged\n    revision of a Docker image.\n- production - The production environment is deployed using task definitions\n    that were created in promoting ``test`` to ``stage``.\n\n``ecs-deploy`` is used in the deployment pipeline for an ECS service. It expects\na stable base task definition that is always running in the ``test``\nenvironment. This task definition should point to the ``latest`` tag for a\nDocker image.  If invoked for the ``test`` environment, ``ecs-deploy`` simply\nany running tasks.\n\nWhen invoked for the ``stage`` environment, the current task definition for\nthe ``test`` environment is downloaded and modified to replace the ``latest``\ntag for the Docker image with the specified tag revision.\n\nWhen invoked for the ``production`` environment, it will update the service\nto use a task definition using the specified tag version.",
