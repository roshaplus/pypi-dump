Molecule is opinionated in order to encourage an approach\nthat results in consistently developed roles that are well-written, easily\nunderstood and maintained.\n\nMolecule uses `Ansible`_ `playbooks`_ to exercise the `role`_ and its\nassociated tests.  Molecule supports any provider [#]_ that `Ansible`_\nsupports.\n\n.. [#]\n\n   Providers can be bare-metal, virtual, cloud or containers.  If Ansible can\n   use it, Molecule can test it.  Molecule simply leverages Ansible's module\n   system to manage instances.\n\n.. _`playbooks`: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks.html\n.. _`role`: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_roles.html\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nhttp://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/v2/\n\nAnsible Support\n===============\n\n* 2.2.2.0\n* 2.3.0.0\n\n.. _`Ansible`: https://docs.ansible.com\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n`MIT`_\n\n.. _`MIT`: https://github.com/metacloud/molecule/blob/v2/LICENSE\n\nThe logo is licensed under the `Creative Commons NoDerivatives 4.0 License`_.\nIf you have some other use in mind, contact us.\n\n.. _`Creative Commons NoDerivatives 4.0 License`: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/",
