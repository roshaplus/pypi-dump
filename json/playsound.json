    "description": "playsound\n=========\n*Pure Python, cross platform, single function module with no dependencies for playing sounds.*\n\nInstallation\n------------\nInstall via pip:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install playsound\n\nDone.\n\nIf you insist on the (slightly) harder way of installing, from source,\nyou know how to do it already and don't need my help.\n\nThe latest version of the source code can be found at:\nhttps://github.com/TaylorSMarks/playsound\n\nQuick Start\n-----------\nOnce you've installed, you can really quickly verified that it works with just this:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> from playsound import playsound\n    >>> playsound('/path/to/a/sound/file/you/want/to/play.mp3') \n\nDocumentation\n-------------\nThe playsound module contains only one thing - the function (also named) playsound.\n\nIt requires one argument - the path to the file with the sound you'd like to play. This may be a local file, or a URL.\n\nThere's an optional second argument, block, which is set to True by default. Setting it to False makes the function run asynchronously.\n\nOn Windows, uses windll.winmm. WAVE and MP3 have been tested and are known to work. Other file formats may work as well.\n\nOn OS X, uses AppKit.NSSound. WAVE and MP3 have been tested and are known to work. In general, anything QuickTime can play, playsound should be able to play, for OS X.\n\nOn Linux, uses ossaudiodev. I don't have a machine with Linux, so this hasn't been tested at all. Theoretically, it plays WAVE files. Any other file format working would surprise me. The block argument is not used on Linux - I do not know whether the function blocks on Linux or not.\n\nRequirements\n------------\nI've only tested playsound it with Python 2.7 on Windows 7 and OS X 10.11, but\nI expect that it should work on Windows XP thru 10 at least, OS X 10.5 and newer,\nall versions of Linux, and Python 2.3 and newer.\n\nCopyright\n---------\nThis software is Copyright (c) 2016 Taylor Marks <taylor@marksfam.com>.\n\nSee the bundled LICENSE file for more information.",
