    "description": "Python Device Cloud Library\n===========================\n\n|Build Status| |Coverage Status| |Code Climate| |Latest Version|\n|License|\n\nBe sure to check out the `full\ndocumentation <http://digidotcom.github.io/python-devicecloud>`__. A\n`Changelog <https://github.com/digidotcom/python-devicecloud/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`__\nis also available.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nPython-devicecloud is a library providing simple, intuitive access to\nthe `Digi Device\nCloud <http://www.digi.com/products/cloud/digi-device-cloud>`__ for\nclients written in Python.\n\nThe library wraps the Device Cloud REST API and hides the details of\nforming HTTP requests in order to gain access to device information,\nfile data, streams, and other features of the device cloud. The API\nwrapped can be found\n`here <http://ftp1.digi.com/support/documentation/90002008_redirect.htm>`__.\n\nThe primary target audience for this library is individuals interfacing\nwith the device cloud from the server side or developers writing tools\nto aid device development. For efficient connectivity from devices, we\nsuggest that you first look at using the `Device Cloud\nConnector <http://www.digi.com/support/productdetail?pid=5575>`__. That\nbeing said, this library could also be used on devices if deemed\nsuitable.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nThe library provides access to a wide array of features, but here is a\ncouple quick examples to give you a taste of what the API looks like.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from devicecloud import DeviceCloud\n\n    dc = DeviceCloud('user', 'pass')\n\n    # show the MAC address of all devices that are currently connected\n    #\n    # This is done using the device cloud DeviceCore functionality\n    print \"== Connected Devices ==\"\n    for device in dc.devicecore.get_devices():\n        if device.is_connected():\n            print device.get_mac()\n\n    # get the name and current value of all data streams having values\n    # with a floating point type\n    #\n    # This is done using the device cloud stream functionality\n    for stream in dc.streams.get_streams():\n        if stream.get_data_type().lower() in ('float', 'double'):\n            print \"%s -> %s\" % (stream.get_stream_id(), stream.get_current_value())\n\nFor more examples and detailed documentation, be sure to checkout out\nthe `Full API\nDocumentation <https://digidotcom.github.io/python-devicecloud>`__.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThis library can be installed using\n`pip <https://github.com/pypa/pip>`__. Python versions 2.7+ (including\nPython 3) are supported by the library.\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    pip install devicecloud\n\nIf you already have an older version of the library installed, you can\nupgrade to the latest version by doing\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    pip install --upgrade devicecloud\n\nSupported Features\n------------------\n\nEventually, it is hoped that there will be complete feature parity\nbetween the device cloud API and this library. For now, however, that is\nnot the case. The current features are supported by the library:\n\n-  Getting basic device information via DeviceCore\n-  Provision and Delete devices via DeviceCore\n-  Listing devices associated with a device cloud account\n-  Interacting with Device Cloud Data Streams\n-  Create Streams\n-  Get Stream (by id)\n-  List all streams\n-  Get metadata for a stream\n-  Write a single datapoint to a stream\n-  Write many datapoints to a stream (homogeneous bulk write)\n-  Write many datapoints to multiple streams (heterogeneous bulk write)\n-  Read data points from a stream (includes control over order of\n   returned data set as well as allowing for retrieving data roll-ups,\n   etc.)\n-  Support for accessing Device Cloud FileData store\n-  Get filedata matching a provided condition (path, file extension,\n   size, etc.)\n-  Write files to filedata store\n-  Recursively walk filedata directory tree from some root location\n-  Get full metadata and contents of files and directories.\n-  Low level support for performing basic SCI commands with limited\n   parsing of results and support for only a subset of available\n   services/commands.\n-  APIs to make direct web service calls to the device cloud with some\n   details handled by the library (see DeviceCloudConnection and 'ws'\n   documentation)\n-  Device Provisioning via Mac Address, IMEI or Device ID\n-  Monitors\n-  Creating a TCP or HTTP monitor\n\nThe following features are *not* supported at this time. Feedback on\nwhich features should be highest priority is always welcome.\n\n-  Alarms\n-  Scheduled Operations\n-  Asynchronous SCI requests\n-  High level access to many SCI/RCI operations\n-  DeviceMetaData\n-  DeviceVendor\n-  FileDataHistory\n-  NetworkInterface support\n-  XBee specific support (XBeeCore)\n-  Smart Energy APIs\n-  SMS Support\n-  Satellite/Iridium Support\n-  SM/UDP Support\n-  Carrier Information Access\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nContributions to the library are very welcome in whatever form can be\nprovided. This could include issue reports, bug fixes, or features\nadditions. For issue reports, please `create an issue against the Github\nproject <https://github.com/digidotcom/python-devicecloud/issues>`__.\n\nFor code changes, feel free to fork the project on Github and submit a\npull request with your changes.
