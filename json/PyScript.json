    "description": "PyScript is a python module for producing high quality postscript graphics.\r\nRather than use a GUI to draw a picture, the picture is programmed using python\r\nand the PyScript objects.\r\n\r\nSome of the key features are:\r\n    * All scripting is done in python, which is a high level, easy to learn,\r\nwell-developed scripting language.\r\n    * All the objects can be translated, scaled, rotated, ... in fact any affine\r\ntransformation.\r\n    * Plain text is automatically kerned.\r\n    * You can place arbitrary LaTeX expressions on your figures.\r\n    * You can create your own figure objects, and develop a library of figure\r\nprimitives.\r\n    * Output is publication quality.",
