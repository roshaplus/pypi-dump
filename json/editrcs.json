    "description": "EditRCS is a library to with functions to read RCS files into Python\nclasses Rcs and RcsDelta, and to manipulate them and write them to a new\nRCS file.\n\nIt is intended to be used to manipulate RCS files in ways that the RCS tools\ndon't support, but it requires some knowledge of how RCS files work rather\nthan being a polished command-line tool.\n\nSee rcsfile(5) for RCS file format definition.\n\nExample scripts in the examples directory include:\n\ncheckout_start: print the earliest version of a RCS file to standard output.\nrcs_join: produce an RCS file with the history of one file followed by that of \n          a second file.\nrename_user: replace an old user name with a new one for each revision checked\n             in by that user.\npivot_branch: given a branch head and a first-level branch head off that, swap\n              the sub-branch and the main branch.\n\nLimitations: I'm going with the 5.9.2 version of the manpage, and ignoring \nthe newphrase in the earlier (e.g. 5.6) specifications for now.\nIt is written to be simple rather than optimised for speed or space.\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n------------\n\nTo install as a Python module run this as root:\n\n    python setup.py install",
