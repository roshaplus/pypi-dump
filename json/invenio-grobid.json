For more information about this and more, read the official Grobid documentation.\n\n.. _Grobid: http://grobid.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    pip install invenio-grobid\n\n\nNote that you also need a running Grobid `REST service`_.\n\n.. _REST service: http://grobid.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Grobid-service/\n\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nAdd ``invenio_grobid`` package to your Invenio ``PACKAGES`` config in your\n``overlay/config.py`` to be picked up by the Invenio application loader.\n\n\nConfigure the URL to your Grobid REST service with ``GROBID_HOST``.\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    inveniomanage config set GROBID_HOST 'http://localhost:8080'\n\n\nIf you want to change your standard upload handler after extraction, update ``GROBID_RESULT_HANDLER``.\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    inveniomanage config set GROBID_RESULT_HANDLER 'my_overlay.grobid:upload_handler'\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThe uploader interface is available under the ``/grobid`` endpoint by default. E.g. http://localhost:4000/grobid\n\n* Choose a PDF to extract metadata from and hit ``Upload``.\n* Wait a bit and metadata will be displayed.\n* Click on ``Submit`` button to push the metadata to your ``GROBID_RESULT_HANDLER``\n\n*Special thanks to Joseph Boyd (@jcboyd) and Gilles Louppe (@glouppe) for Grobid support.*\n\nHappy hacking and thanks for flying Invenio Grobid.\n\n| INSPIRE Development Team\n|   Email: feedback@inspirehep.net\n|   Twitter: http://twitter.com/inspirehep\n|   GitHub: https://github.com/inspirehep/invenio-grobid\n|   URL: http://inspirehep.net\n\n\n..\n    This file is part of Invenio.\n    Copyright (C) 2015 CERN.\n\n    Invenio is free software; you can redistribute it\n    and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as\n    published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the\n    License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    Invenio is distributed in the hope that it will be\n    useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
