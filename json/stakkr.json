    "description": ".. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edyan/stakkr/master/docs/stakkr-logo.png\n    :width: 200px\n    :align: center\n\nOverview\n==================================\n.. image:: https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/edyan/stakkr/badges/quality-score.png?b=master\n.. image:: https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/edyan/stakkr/badges/build.png?b=master\n\n\nStakkr is a a docker recompose tool that uses docker compose to easily\ncreate / maintain a stack of services, for example for web development.\n\nVia a configuration file you can setup the required services and\nlet stakkr link and start everything for you.\n\nIt works only in CLI.\n\nFull Documentation: http://stakkr.readthedocs.org\n\n\nVersions\n=============\n.. IMPORTANT::\n   Stakkr has known 3 versions and 3 names :\n   - 1.x : it was called ``docker-lamp`` and was made to setup an Apache + PHP + MySQL Environment\n   - 2.x : it was called ``marina`` (nice name!) and was made to have a stack build around various\n   services.\n   - 3.x : current version (and probably future ones) , now ``stakkr``. Why changing its name again ?\n   Because marina is used by various people and therefore our tool could add more confusion.\n\n\n\nWhat does that do exactly ?\n==============================\nIf you have heard of Docker, you know that when you need to build a full environment\nwith multiple services that are linked, you either have to do everything manually or\nuse `docker-compose`. The second solution is the best _but_ it implies that you need, for each\nenvironment, to change your parameters, choose your images, learn the `docker-compose` command\nline tool, etc ... In brief, it's not very flexible and hard to learn.\n\nStakkr will help you, via a very simple configuration file and a predefined list of services\n(that can be extended by plugins) to build a complete environment. Plus, to control it in command line.\nIt makes use of docker easy.\n\nLast, but not the least, it's highly configurable and each service mounts a volume to have a persistence\nof data. You can even, if you want, add more directives on some services (change the `php.ini` for\nexample and chose your versions (PHP 5.3 or 5.6 or 7.1 or anything else).\n\n\nExamples\n==============\nYou can combine services as you want to have :\n\n- A **Dev LAMP stack** (Apache + MySQL 5.7 + PHP 7.1 with xdebug and xhprof) ...\n  and if suddenly you want to test your code with PHP 7.1,\n  change it in `conf/compose.ini`, restart, it's done !\n- Or Apache 2.4 + PHP 5.6 + MongoDB for a **production environment**\n- Or **only Maildev**\n- Or **only PHP 5.4 + ElasticSearch**\n- etc...",
