    "description": "TkPane is a Python package designed to simplify \nthe construction of a \nTkinter user interface by encapsulating one or more widgets into 'pane' \nobjects that have no direct dependence on any other UI elements.  Panes \ninteract with other application elements only through a standardized \ninterface of methods and callback functions. The ``tkpane`` package \nallows custom panes to be created that can be easily re-used in \nmultiple applications.  When multiple panes are assembled for use in a \nsingle UI, and some panes require data from other panes, each such \ndependency can be established with a simple method call.  Panes that \nmanage data (e.g., user entries) can automatically pass that data to \nother panes.  Other application code can also easily obtain a pane's \ndata in the form of a Python dictionary.\n\nThe ``tkpane`` package provides the ``TkPane`` class, which should\nbe subclassed to create pane objects that contain whatever combination\nof Tkinter widgets and behavior is desired.  Several general-purpose\ncustom panes are provided in the ``tkpane.lib`` package.  These pane\nclasses can be used as-is, or used as templates for the construction\nof other custom pane classes.\n\nThere are two types of interactions between panes that are\nhandled by panes created with the ``tkpane`` package:\n\n* Actions, whereby one pane changes the state of another pane.\n* Data sharing, whereby one pane sends data to, or requests data from,\n  another pane.\n\nPanes created with the\n``tkpane`` package, can have three actions applied to them:\n\n* Enable: The pane is made able to accept user input.\n* Disable: The pane is made unable to accept user input.\n* Clear: Any data displayed by the pane is removed.\n\nPanes can also automatically perform these actions on other panes\ndepending on whether the data that the pane manages is valid or invalid.\nTo indicate that a pane named ``ok_pane`` should not be enabled until\nanother pane named ``output_pane`` contains valid data, all that is\nnecessary is to call the ``requires()`` method of ``ok_pane``, like so::\n\n    ok_pane.requires(output_pane)\n\nEach pane manages its own data in a Python dictionary, and when one pane\nenables another pane, it passes that data dictionary to the second\npane's ``enable()`` method.  This is an important (but not the only)\nmethod of sharing data between panes.\n\nPanes also automatically generate status messages describing changes\nto data in their widgets, and provide callback hooks to send those\nstatus messages to other panes or other application objects.  Quantitative\nprogress indicators can be handled the same way.  Two of the panes\nin ``tkpane.lib`` are designed to accept and display status messages,\nand one of these is also designed to accept and display progress\ninformation.\n\nFull documentation for the ``tkpane`` library is at http://tkpane.readthedocs.io/\n",
