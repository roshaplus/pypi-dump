    "description": "Robin is an Open-Source project providing quick, hands-free automated bindings\r\nof C++ libraries for Python, and possibly some other scripting languages (such\r\nas Java, Groovy, and Ruby) in the future. This is achieved by creating a minimal\r\namount of \"Glue Code\" above the existing routines, along with some \"Meta-Data\"\r\nwhich, when combined with a thin run-time mechanism exposes the C++ types as\r\nnative types in the target language.\r\n\r\nRobin's main ideal is to make bindings as tight as possible, such that usability\r\nwill resemble that which the user can produce in the original C++ code; Some\r\nexamples of such \"sharp edges\" are:\r\n\r\n    * Imitating C++-style implicit conversions\r\n    * Coupling STL primitives with the primitives of the target language\r\n    * Automatic template instantiation and exposure of template instances\r\n    * Allowing user Python code to derive from a C++ interface class and\r\nimplement virtual methods",
