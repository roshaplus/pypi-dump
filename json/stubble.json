See\r\n\r\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/reahl-stubble for the newer versions.\r\n\r\n==================================================================\r\n\r\nStubble is a collection of tools for writing stubs in unit tests.\r\n\r\nUsing stubs allows one to decouple one unit test from real code \r\nunrelated to it - you write a fake class to take the place of \r\na real one (which this test is not testing).\r\n\r\nStubble ensures, however, that the test will break should the\r\ninterface of the stub differ from that of the real class it is a stub\r\nfor.",
