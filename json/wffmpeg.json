    "description": "wffmpeg is a wrapper to ffmpeg command line program, written in python. Is structured as a base library, easy to extend by combining standard ffmpeg features.\n\nrequires an ffmpeg executable file. Due to this it's (almost) multi-platform.\n\nCommon behaviour needs the use of two classess:\n\n- FFDocument, an audio/video document who is editable by apply one\nor more effects\n- FFmpeg, the cli wrapper. A FFmpeg instance is used to extract metadata\nfrom files and to execute an effects chain (using one or more FFDocument objects) in order to create a new document.\nA FFmpeg object can be created by specify a path for your ffmpeg executable. Thus, it can be possible to use multiple ffmpeg instances and multiple versions.\n\nThe invocation of a FFDocument's effect method returns a new modified object. This means that effects are chainable. For example:\n\n    ff = FFDocument(\"/home/leonardo/movie.flv\")\n    ffresult = ff.resize(\"50%\").ltrim(10).resample(120)\n\n\nwffmpeg is developped by leofiore@gmail.com .\n\nKATO Kanryu<k.kanryu@gmail.com> exposed at PyPi this about SVN-2\n\nHere it might be not the newest version about the library.\nIf you want to get newer one, to visit the official HP.\nhttp://code.google.com/p/wffmpeg/",
