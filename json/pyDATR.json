    "description": "pyDATR is an implementation of the DATR language written in Python.\r\nIt can parse DATR theories and evaluate queries against them. It\r\nalso contains a persistence layer that allows storing theories and\r\nnodes in a relational database. Theories that have been stored through\r\nthis layer can later be partially loaded and will transparently\r\nretrieve nodes from the database as needed, thus reducing memory\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nThere's not much there in the way of a user interface as it is intended\r\nto be called from Python scripts.",
