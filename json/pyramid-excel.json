    "description": "================================================================================\npyramid-excel - Let you focus on data, instead of file formats\n================================================================================\n\n.. image:: https://api.travis-ci.org/pyexcel/pyramid-excel.svg?branch=master\n   :target: http://travis-ci.org/pyexcel/pyramid-excel\n\n.. image:: https://codecov.io/github/pyexcel/pyramid-excel/coverage.png\n    :target: https://codecov.io/github/pyexcel/pyramid-excel\n\n.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyramid-excel/badge/?version=latest\n   :target: http://pyramid-excel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n\n**pyramid-excel** is based on `pyexcel <https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel>`_ and makes\nit easy to consume/produce information stored in excel files over HTTP protocol as\nwell as on file system. This library can turn the excel data into a list of lists,\na list of records(dictionaries), dictionaries of lists. And vice versa. Hence it\nlets you focus on data in Pyramid based web development, instead of file formats.\n\nThe idea originated from the problem of the illiteracy of excel file formats of\nnon-technical office workers: such as office assistant, human resource administrator.\nThere is nothing with the un-deniable fact that some people do not know the\ndifference among various excel formats. It becomes usability problem to those\npeople when a web service cannot parse the excel file that they saved using\nMicrosoft Excel. Instead of training those people about file formats, this library\nhelps web developers to handle most of the excel file formats by unifying the\nprogramming interface to most of the excel readers and writers.\n\nThe highlighted features are:\n\n#. excel data import into and export from databases\n#. turn uploaded excel file directly into Python data struture\n#. pass Python data structures as an excel file download\n#. provide data persistence as an excel file in server side\n#. supports csv, tsv, csvz, tsvz by default and other formats are supported via\n   the following plugins:\n\n.. _file-format-list:\n\n.. table:: A list of file formats supported by external plugins\n\n   ================ ========================================\n   Plugins          Supported file formats\n   ================ ========================================\n   `pyexcel-xls`_   xls, xlsx(r), xlsm(r)\n   `pyexcel-xlsx`_  xlsx\n   `pyexcel-ods3`_  ods (python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4)\n   `pyexcel-ods`_   ods (python 2.6, 2.7)\n   `pyexcel-text`_  (write only)json, rst, mediawiki,\n                    latex, grid, pipe, orgtbl, plain simple\n   ================ ========================================\n\n.. _pyexcel-xls: https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-xls\n.. _pyexcel-xlsx: https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-xlsx\n.. _pyexcel-ods: https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-ods\n.. _pyexcel-ods3: https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-ods3\n.. _pyexcel-text: https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-text\n\nThis library makes infomation processing involving various excel files as easy as\nprocessing array, dictionary when processing file upload/download, data import into\nand export from SQL databases, information analysis and persistence. It uses\n**pyexcel** and its plugins:\n\n#. to provide one uniform programming interface to handle csv, tsv, xls, xlsx, xlsm and ods formats.\n#. to provide one-stop utility to import the data in uploaded file into a database and to export tables in a database as excel files for file download.\n#. to provide the same interface for information persistence at server side: saving a uploaded excel file to and loading a saved excel file from file system.\n\nKnown constraints\n==================\n\nFonts, colors and charts are not supported.\n\n\nInstallation\n================================================================================\nYou can install it via pip:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install pyramid-excel\n\n\nor clone it and install it:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ git clone http://github.com/pyexcel/pyramid-excel.git\n    $ cd pyramid-excel\n    $ python setup.py install\n\nSetup\n======\nOnce the pyramid_excel is installed, you must use the config.include mechanism to include\nit into your Pyramid project's configuration::\n\n    config = Configurator(.....)\n    config.include('pyramid_excel')\n\nAlternately, you may activate the extension by changing your application's .ini file by\nadding it to the pyramid.includes list::\n\n    pyramid.includes = pyramid_excel\n\n\n\nLicense\n================================================================================\n\nNew BSD License",
