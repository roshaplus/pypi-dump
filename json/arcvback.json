    "description": "added excludedir filter to exclude some subdirectories\n        from within the set of backup directories.  This is useful\n        when backing up Visual C++ projects where you don't want the\n        compiler output files (like .objs) to be backed up. Fixed a\n        few bugs as well.\n        See the release notes page for more \n        details: http://arcvback.com/arcvback_releasenotes.html",
