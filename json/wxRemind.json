    "description": "**wxRemind has been replaced by etm_qt, which is also available from PyPI, and is no longer being actively maintained.**\r\n \r\nwxRemind is a wxPython-based front-end for Remind, a powerful calendar and\r\nalarm application. The display features a calendar and daily event list\r\nsuitable for visualizing your schedule at a glance. Dates and associated events\r\ncan be quickly selected either with the mouse or cursor keys, and dates in the\r\ncalendar are color coded to reflect the total duration of scheduled events.\r\nwxRemind integrates with an external editor of your choice to make editing of\r\nreminder files more efficient, provides hotkeys to quickly access the most\r\ncommon Remind options and supports visual, sound and/or spoken alerts.\r\n\r\nApplication includes three stand-alone executable files that work on both linux\r\nand os x platforms.\r\n\r\n1. wxremind - the main program - a gui for remind. After starting program press\r\n? for usage information.\r\n\r\n2. wxremalert - a standalone alert/notification utility designed to be used with\r\nremind's RUN command.  At a command prompt, enter wxremalert -h for usage.\r\n\r\n3. wxremdata - a standalone alternative for 'rem'. At a command prompt, enter\r\nwxremdata -h for usage.\r\n\r\nA tar file containing all sources is also available.",
