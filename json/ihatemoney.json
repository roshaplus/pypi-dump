    "description": "Budget-manager\n##############\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/spiral-project/ihatemoney.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/spiral-project/ihatemoney\n   :alt: Travis CI Build Status\n\nThis is a really tiny app to ease the shared houses budget management. Keep\ntrack of who bought what, when, and for who to then compute the balance of each\nperson.\n\nThe code is distributed under a BSD beerware derivative: if you meet the people\nin person and you want to pay them a beer, you are encouraged to do so (see\nLICENSE for more details).\n\nMake it run!\n============\n\nWith a `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/>`_ environment,\n`pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/>`_ and\n`virtualenv <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ installed,\nyou just have to run the following command::\n\n    $ make serve\n\nThis will run a Flask app available at `http://localhost:5000`.\n\nDeploy it\n=========\n\nYou have multiple options to deploy ihatemoney. Two of them are documented at the moment:\n\nWith Apache and mod_wsgi\n------------------------\n\n1. Install Apache and mod_wsgi - libapache2-mod-wsgi(-py3) for Debian based and mod_wsgi for RedHat based distributions -\n\n2. Create an Apache virtual host based on the sample configuration file in conf/apache-vhost.conf\n\n3. Adapt it to your paths and specify your virtualenv path if you use one\n\n4. Activate the virtual host if needed and restart Apache\n\nWith Nginx, Gunicorn and Supervisord\n------------------------------------\n\n1. Add the lines in conf/supervisord.conf to your supervisord.conf file.\n   **adapt them to your paths!**\n2. Copy and paste the content of conf/nginx.conf in your nginx conf file.\n   **adapt them to your paths!**\n3. reload both nginx and supervisord. It should be working ;)\n\nDon't forget to set the right permission for your files !\n\nConfigure it\n============\n\nIn a production environment\n---------------------------\n\nMake a copy of ``budget/default_settings.py`` and name it ``ihatemoney.cfg``.\nThen adjust the settings to your needs and move this file to\n``/etc/ihatemoney/ihatemoney.cfg``.\nThis is the default path of the settings but you can also place it\nelsewhere and pass the configuration file path to the application using\nthe IHATEMONEY_SETTINGS_FILE_PATH environment variable.\ne.g.::\n\n    $ export IHATEMONEY_SETTINGS_FILE_PATH=\"/path/to/your/conf/file.cfg\"\n\nNote that you can also pass additional flask parameters with this file.\ne.g. If you want to prefix your URLs to serve ihatemonney in the *folder*\nof a domain, use the following: ::\n\n    APPLICATION_ROOT='/budget'\n\nIn a dev environment\n--------------------\n\nIt is better to actually turn the debugging mode on when you're developing.\nYou can create a ``settings.cfg`` file, with the following content::\n\n    DEBUG = True\n    SQLACHEMY_ECHO = DEBUG\n\nYou can also set the `TESTING` flag to `True` so no mails are sent\n(and no exception is raised) while you're on development mode.\nThen before running the application, declare its path with ::\n\n    $ export IHATEMONEY_SETTINGS_FILE_PATH=\"$(pwd)/settings.cfg\"\n\nThe REST API?\n=============\n\nYep, you're right, there is a REST API with this. Head to the `api\ndocumentation <https://ihatemoney.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>`_ to know more.\n\nHow to contribute\n=================\n\nYou would like to contribute? First, thanks a bunch! This project is a small\nproject with just a few people behind it, so any help is appreciated!\n\nThere are different ways to help us, regarding if you are a designer,\na developer or an user.\n\nAs a developer\n--------------\n\nIf you want to contribute code, you can write it and then issue a pull request on\ngithub. Please, think about updating and running the tests before asking for\na pull request as it will help us to maintain the code clean and running.\n\nTo do so::\n\n    $ make test\n\nAs a designer / Front-end developer\n-----------------------------------\n\nFeel free to provide us mockups or to involve yourself into the discussions\nhapenning on the github issue tracker. All ideas are welcome. Of course, if you\nknow how to implement them, feel free to fork and make a pull request.\n\nEnd-user\n--------\n\nYou are using the application and found a bug? You have some ideas about how to\nimprove the project? Please tell us [by filling a new issue](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/issues).\nOr, if you prefer, you can send me an email to `alexis@notmyidea.org` and I will\nupdate the issue tracker with your feedback.\n\nThanks again!\n\nHow to release?\n===============\n\nIn order to prepare a new release, we are following the following steps:\n\n- Merge remaining pull requests;\n- Update :file:`CHANGELOG.rst` with the last changes;\n- Update :file:`CONTRIBUTORS`;\n- Update known good versions of dependencies in ``requirements.txt`` with this command (from inside the venv):\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n     $ pip freeze | grep -v -- '-e' > requirements.txt\n\nOnce this is done, use the \"release\" instruction:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n     $ make release \n\nAnd the new version should be published on PyPI.\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\nThis document describes changes between each past release.\n\n1.0 (2017-06-20)\n----------------\n\n### Added\n\n- Apache WSGI Support (#191)\n- Brush up the Makefile (#207, #201)\n- Externalize the settings from source folder (#193)\n- Makefile: Add new rule to compile translations (#207)\n- Project creation can be restricted to admin (#210)\n- More responsive layout (#213)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Some README enhancements\n- Move tests to budget.tests (#205)\n- The demo project can be disabled (#209)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fix sphinx integration (#208)\n\n0.9 (2017-04-04)\n----------------\n\n- First release of the project.",
