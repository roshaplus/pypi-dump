    "description": "# art - AXI register tool\n\nUtility for simply creating and modifying AXI Slave modules.\n\n## Concept\n\nThe main goal of the project is to able to automatically create and modify AXI slave modules based on a simple definition format. By employing VHDL records the handling of the registers can be completely hidden in a module seperate from the rest of the designers logic. All referring to the registers are done via a record which specifies if the register is read-only or read-write, and also includes the name. All AXI-specific signals are also wrapped in records. This increases the readability of the design as a whole.\n  \n\n## Getting Started\n\nIt is highly recommended to employ virtual environments while tinkering with this project. See below for short howto.\n\n### Requirements\n\nThe utility require Python3 and pip. The requirements for running the utility, and a few more, are listed in `requirements.txt`. To install them in your virtual environment run the following command:\n\n`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`\n\nIf you are contributing and have added a module to the project, update the requirements by running:\n\n`$ pip freeze > requirements.txt`\n\n### Run\n\nView program help by simply running the main file:\n\n`$ python3 art.py -h`\n\n### Examples\n\nThe examples folder is currently empty, except for the required Bitvis libraries for testing. However, two JSON files for creating a module is provided in the art/ directory. \n\n### Virtual Environment\n\nTo create a virtual environment with Python3 when located inside the repo:\n\n```bash\n$ pip install virtualenv\n$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 env\n```\n\nTo activate the virtual environment:\n\n```\n$ source env/bin/activate\n```\n\nWhen running `python` or `pip` commands, these will now refer to Python3 located in env/.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you have ideas on how to improve the project, please review [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.\n\n### Development Flow\n\nThis project uses the dev branch as the root for all feature branches. Please create new feature branches based on the state of this branch.\n\n## Authors\n\n* [Ola Gr\u00f8ttvik](https://github.com/olagrottvik) - *Initial work\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT license - see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.",
