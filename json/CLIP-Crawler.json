    "description": "### University system integration\nIn case you have no clue of what CLIP is then this package is not for you.\n\nThere is a crawler to download every relevant public information out of CLIP in order to populate the bot database (and update it when needed).\nIt requires student credentials.\nEven if you're a student and have the all mighty credentials, its probably not something you'll want to try.\n\nIf you're brave and want to try it, or want that information for something else (please don't be evil), it takes several hours to bootstrap the database, and it's a somewhat error-prone process, which for the bot was done step-by-step, one entity at a time.\nAvoid doing so during times that might disturb other students access to CLIP. This thing does several requests every second. 1AM-6AM(GMT) it's probably your best shot.",
