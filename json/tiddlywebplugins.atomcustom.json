    "description": "a customisable atom feed\n\n*** allows customisations ***\nAn AtomViewTemplate tiddler was considered, however introducing such a mechanism would have created a wealth of problems including invalid w3c markup, an rss item inside an atom feed? Treating bags differently would have required multiple atom template tiddlers which would have been a pain to manage. The simplest solution seemed to be the AtomSettings tiddler (Easy to parse and hopefully readable)\n\n\n*** provides enriched atom feeds ***\nThe new version is geo friendly - mapping the tiddler fields geo.lat and geo.long to valid atom feed tags.",
