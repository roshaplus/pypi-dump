    "description": "This package provides for a (hopefully) clean, simple wrapper around\nmcrypt that can be used from both Python 2 and Python 3 code.  It is\npresently not yet stable, and it can be expected that the interface\nwill not be stable until at least a few versions from now; it will\ndefinitely be stable by 1.0, but it is hoped way before then.",
