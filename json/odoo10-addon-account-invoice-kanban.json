Create a new stage\n\nUsage\n=====\n#. Go to Invoicing menu --> Customers --> Customer Invoices\n#. Enjoy the new kanban view \n#. Drag and drop the invoices from stage to stage\n#. In the form view, click on any new stage to change it\n\nRoadmap / Known Issues\n======================\n* Invoice stages and status are currently not synchronized: this is so since\n  every organization might have different needs and stages. Nevertheless, they\n  can be easily sync'ed (at least from status to Stages) via server actions.\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/account-invoicing/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed feedback.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n* Eric Caudal <eric.caudal@elico-corp.com>\n* Victor M.
