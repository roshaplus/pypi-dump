    "description": "=====================================\nGoanna : SCM Change Monitoring Server\n=====================================\n\n\nGoanna aims to spare source repositories the overheads of frequent polling by CI\nsetups such as Buildbot_. It caches change information pushed to it by\nauthorised repositories, and provides a simple web API for clients to polls for\nchanges.\n\nRedis_ is used as the storage backend.\nBottlePy_ is used to provide the web API.\n\nGoanna is still under development and tested mainly using:\n\n* Python 2.6, Python 2.7\n* Buildbot 0.8.7\n\nIf you wish to try it out, do consider running the tests (see below) just to\nmake sure it behaves in your setup.\n\nTODOs:\n======\n\n* Logging\n* Example VCS Commit hooks (CVS, SVN, Git, Mercurial)\n* `Github-webhook`_ compatible API, or better, submit a Github service hook\n* Housekeeping scripts (delete old commit data, etc)\n* Web APIs for reporting (latest revisions, storate stats, etc)\n\n\nRequirements:\n=============\n\n* BottlePy_\n* `redis-py`_\n* hiredis_ - Optional. Used by redis-py when installed. Better performance.\n\nAdditional requirements to run tests:\n\n* Trial_\n* WebTest_ - to test web api\n* mock_ - to test GoannaPoller\n* coverage.py_ - Optional. For coverage testing.\n\n\nRunning tests:\n==============\n\nWhile we write most of the tests for Goanna using the standard\n`unittest module`_, some tests required additional modules. For example, we\nuse WebTest_ to support the testing of the WSGI-based web api and\nTrial_ to enable the testing of GoannaPoller.\n\nTo simplify test management and execution (and since we're already using it),\nwe use Trial_ to launch tests::\n\n    trial goanna.tests\n\n\nIt is possible to get coverage results using ``trial --coverage`` however, the\noutput can be a little unwieldy. To obtain sensible coverage results, we use\n`coverage.py`_::\n\n    coverage run `which trial` goanna.tests  # run test while collecting coverage stats\n    coverage html  # generate HTML report (output in htmlcov directory)\n\n\nDeploying the Web App:\n======================\n\nFor development and testing purposes, you can use ``examples/scripts/run_dev_web.py``\nto launch a basic server.\n\nFor deployment, the app can be deployed just like any other Bottle app (see\n`bottle docs for deployment <http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/deployment.html>`_).\n\nTo get an app instance, use::\n\n    from goanna.webapi import GoannaInABottle\n    application = GoannaInABottle(\"/path/to/goanna_web_config.py\").get_app()\n\nAn example config file can be found in the ``examples/config`` directory of the\nsource distribution. If a config file is not provided, the module will look for\na ``config.py`` file in the current working directory failing which default\nsettings will be applied.\n\n\n\n.. _BottlePy: http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/\n.. _redis-py: https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py#readme\n.. _hiredis: https://github.com/redis/hiredis#readme \n.. _Trial: http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedTrial\n.. _WebTest: http://webtest.pythonpaste.org\n.. _mock: http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/\n.. _Buildbot: http://trac.buildbot.net/\n.. _Redis: http://redis.io/\n.. _unittest module: http://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html \n.. _coverage.py: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/ \n.. _Github-webhook: https://help.github.com/articles/post-receive-hooks",
