    "description": "PynPoint is a python package for analysing exo-planet imaging data. \r\nWhen trying to image planets around a nearby star, the basic idea is \r\nto take many, typically several thousands, of frames and to process \r\nthe data using statistical methods. The aim is to remove the light from \r\nthe star, so as to reveal the companion planet.\r\n\r\nThe PynPoint package has been developed at ETH Zurich as a collaboration \r\nbetween the Star and Planet Formation group and the Cosmology Research \r\ngroup of the Institute of Astronomy. Details of the methodology behind \r\nPynPoint can be found in our method paper. The package was further developed, \r\nwith the support of the Software Lab of the Cosmology Research group, \r\nand is now publicly available. Further information on the package can also be \r\nfound in our code description paper.",
