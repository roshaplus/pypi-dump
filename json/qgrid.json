    "description": ".. image:: https://media.quantopian.com/logos/open_source/qgrid-logo-03.png\n    :target: https://qgrid.readthedocs.io\n    :width: 190px\n    :align: center\n    :alt: qgrid\n\n=====\nqgrid\n=====\nQgrid is an IPython widget which uses `SlickGrid <https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid>`_ to render pandas DataFrames\nwithin a Jupyter notebook. This allows you to explore your DataFrames with intuitive scrolling, sorting, and\nfiltering controls, **as well as edit your DataFrames by double clicking a cell (new in v0.3.0)**.\n\nWe originally developed qgrid for use in `Quantopian's hosted research environment\n<https://www.quantopian.com/research?utm_source=github&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=qgrid-repo>`_, but no longer have\na specific project in mind for using qgrid in the research environment.  For that reason we haven't been investing\nmuch time in developing new features, and almost all of the forward development has come from the community. We've\nmainly just been reviewing PR's, writing docs, and occasionally making small contributions.\n\nDemo\n----\nSee the demo by viewing `qgrid_demo.ipynb\n<http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/TimShawver/b4bc80d1128407c56c9a>`_ in nbviewer.\n\nAPI Documentation\n-----------------\nAPI documentation is hosted on `readthedocs <http://qgrid.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n**Python Dependencies:**\n\nQgrid runs on `Python 2 or 3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.  You'll also need\n`pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ for the installation steps below.\n\nQgrid depends on the following three Python packages:\n\n    `Jupyter notebook <https://github.com/jupyter/notebook>`_\n      This is the interactive Python environment in which qgrid runs.\n\n    `ipywidgets <https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets>`_\n      In order for Jupyter notebooks to be able to run widgets, you have to also install this ipywidgets package.\n      It's maintained by the Jupyter organization, the same people who created Jupyter notebook.\n\n    `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_\n      A powerful data analysis / manipulation library for Python.  Qgrid requires that the data to be rendered as an\n      interactive grid be provided in the form of a pandas DataFrame.\n\nThese are listed in `requirements.txt <https://github.com/quantopian/qgrid/blob/master/requirements.txt>`_\nand will be automatically installed (if necessary) when qgrid is installed via pip.\n\n**Compatibility:**\n\n=================  ===========================  ==============================\n qgrid             IPython / Jupyter notebook   ipywidgets\n=================  ===========================  ==============================\n 0.2.0             2.x                          N/A\n 0.3.x             3.x                          N/A\n 0.3.x             4.0                          4.0.x\n 0.3.x             4.1                          4.1.x\n 0.3.2             4.2                          5.x\n=================  ===========================  ==============================\n\n**Installing from PyPI:**\n\nQgrid is on `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ and can be installed like this::\n\n    pip install qgrid\n\nIf you need to install a specific version of qgrid, pip allows you to specify it like this::\n\n    pip install qgrid==0.2.0\n\nSee the `Releases <https://github.com/quantopian/qgrid/releases>`_ page for more details about the versions that\nare available.\n\n**Installing from GitHub:**\n\nThe latest release on PyPI is often out of date, and might not contain the latest bug fixes and features that you\nwant.  To run the latest code that is on master, install qgrid from GitHub instead of PyPI::\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/quantopian/qgrid\n\nRunning the demo notebook locally\n---------------------------------\n\nThe qgrid repository includes a demo notebook which will help you get familiar with the functionality that qgrid\nprovides.  This demo notebook doesn't get downloaded to your machine when you install qgrid with pip, so you'll need\nto clone the qgrid repository to get it.  Here are the steps to clone the repository and run the demo notebook:\n\n#. Clone the repository from GitHub::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/quantopian/qgrid.git\n\n#. Go to the top-level directory of the qgrid repository and run the notebook::\n\n    cd qgrid\n    jupyter notebook\n\n   The advantage of running the notebook from the top-level directoy of the qgrid repository is the sample notebook\n   that comes with qgrid will be available on the first page that appears when the web browser launches.  Here's what\n   you can expect that page to look like:\n\n     .. figure:: docs/images/home_screen.png\n         :align: left\n         :target: docs/images/home_screen.png\n         :width: 800px\n\n         The \"notebook dashboard\" for the jupyter notebook which shows all the files in the current directory.\n\n#. Click on qgrid_demo.ipynb to open it.  Here's what that should like:\n\n     .. figure:: docs/images/notebook_screen.png\n         :align: left\n         :target: docs/images/notebook_screen.png\n         :width: 800px\n\n         The demo notebook, qgrid_demo.ipynb, rendered by a locally-running Jupyter notebook.\n\n#. Click the \"Cell\" menu at the top of the notebook and click \"Run All\" to run all the cells in the notebook and\n   render a few sample qgrids.\n\n        .. figure:: docs/images/qgrid_screen.png\n         :align: left\n         :target: docs/images/qgrid_screen.png\n         :width: 800px\n\n         A sample qgrid, as seen in the demo notebook, qgrid_demo.ipynb.\n\n\nRunning from source\n-------------------\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to qgrid, or just want to be able to modify the source code for your own purposes, you'll\nwant to clone this repository and run qgrid from your local copy of the repository.  The following steps explain how\nto do this.\n\n#. Clone the repository from GitHub and ``cd`` into the top-level directory::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/quantopian/qgrid.git\n    cd qgrid\n\n#. Install the current project in `editable <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs>`_\n   mode::\n\n    pip install -e .\n\n   This will install the packages that qgrid depends on in the normal way, but will do something special for the\n   qgrid package itself.  Instead of copying the qgrid directory to the site-packages directory of the environment where\n   it was installed (like a virualenv), pip will create a symbolic link which links to the directory you passed in to\n   the ``pip install -e``.  The result is changes that you make to the source code will be reflected as soon as you restart\n   the notebook.\n\n#. Run the notebook as you normally would with the following command::\n\n    jupyter notebook\n\n   Now when you make changes to qgrid's Python code,\n   those changes will take effect as soon as you restart the Jupyter notebook server.\n\n#. If the code you need to change is in qgrid's javascript, then call the\n   `nb_install <http://qgrid.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#qgrid.nbinstall>`_ function from within the notebook to copy\n   your latest changes to the \"nbextensions\" folder (i.e. where widgets must put their javascript for it to be found\n   by the notebook).\n",
