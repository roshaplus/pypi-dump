YouTube allows users to upload, view, rate, share, add to favorites, report, comment on videos, and subscribe to other users. It primarily uses the VP9 and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC formats and Dynamic Adaptive streaming over HTTP to display a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media videos. Available content includes video clips, TV show clips, music videos, short and documentary films, audio recordings, movie trailers, live streams, and other content such as video blogging, short original videos, and educational videos. Most of the content on YouTube is uploaded by individuals, but media corporations including CBS, the BBC, Vevo, and Hulu offer some of their material via YouTube as part of the YouTube partnership program. Unregistered users can only watch videos on the site, while registered users are permitted to upload an unlimited number of videos and add comments to videos. Videos deemed potentially inappropriate are available only to registered users affirming themselves to be at least 18 years old.\r\n\r\nYoutube has a lot of excellent resources, based on this point and reference to the source of the pytube library, I write a lightweight python library. The library does not rely on third parties, crawling through the crawler youtube page and to download resources.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nDownload using pip via pypi.\r\n\r\n    pip install Betubedl\r\n\r\nInstructions for use\r\n============\r\n\r\n\r\n",
