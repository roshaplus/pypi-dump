Create a sales order and confirm it.\n#. Deliver the products/services.\n#. Create an invoice and reduce the invoiced quantity. The sales order\n   invoicing status is 'To Invoice'.\n#. Change the status of the sales order to 'Done'.\n#. Check the field 'Force Invoiced'\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/167/9.0\n\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/sale-workflow/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed feedback.\n\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nImages\n------\n\n* Odoo Community Association: `Icon <https://github.com/OCA/maintainer-tools/blob/master/template/module/static/description/icon.svg>`_.\n\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n* Jordi Ballester <jordi.ballester@eficent.com>\n\n\nMaintainer\n----------\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nTo contribute to this module, please visit https://odoo-community.org.",
