    "description": "DOcplex, IBM\u00ae Decision Optimization Modeling for Python\r\n=======================================================\r\n\r\nWelcome to the IBM\u00ae Decision Optimization CPLEX Modeling for Python.\r\nLicensed under the Apache License v2.0.\r\n\r\nWith this library, you can quickly and easily add the power of optimization to\r\nyour application. You can model your problems by using the Python API and solve\r\nthem on the cloud with the IBM\u00ae Decision Optimization on Cloud service or on\r\nyour computer with IBM\u00ae ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio.\r\n\r\nThis library is composed of 2 modules:\r\n\r\n    * IBM\u00ae Decision Optimization CPLEX Optimizer Modeling for Python - with namespace docplex.mp\r\n    * IBM\u00ae Decision Optimization CP Optimizer Modeling for Python - with namespace docplex.cp\r\n\r\nSolving with CPLEX locally requires that IBM\u00ae ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio V12.6.3 or V12.7.0 \r\nis installed on your machine.\r\n\r\nSolving with the IBM\u00ae Decision Optimization on Cloud service requires that you\r\nregister for an account and get the API key.\r\n\r\nThis library is `numpy` friendly.\r\n\r\n`Documentation <https://github.com/IBMDecisionOptimization/docplex-doc>`_\r\n\r\n`Examples <https://github.com/IBMDecisionOptimization/docplex-examples>`_\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n*  ``pip install docplex``\r\n\r\nChangelog\n---------\n\nChanged in 2.4.61:\n``````````````````\n* Both ``docplex.mp`` & ``docplex.cp``:\n   * Support for CPLEX engines 12.8. Some features of docplex2.4 are available only with engines >= 12.8.\n   * Adding new ports (AIX, plinux).\n   * Examples are now available as Zeppelin notebooks.\n\n* In ``docplex.mp``:\n   * Express a linear problem as a scikit-learn tranformer by providing a numpy, a pandas or scipy matrix.\n   * Logical constraints: constratins equivalence, if-then & rshift operator.\n   * Solve hook to add a method to be called at each intermediate solution.\n   * KPIS automatically published at each intermediate solution if running on docplexcloud python worker.\n   * Support for scipy coo & csr matrixes.\n\n* In ``docplex.cp``:\n   * add new method run_seeds() to execute a model multiple times, available with local solver 12.8.\n   * add support of new solver infos 'SearchStatus' eand 'SearchStopCause'.\n   * In method ``docplex.cp.model.CpoModel.propagate()``, add possibility to add an optional constraint to the model.\n   * add domain iterator in integer variables and integer variables solutions, allowing to get domain\n     as a list of individual integers.\n   * add possibility to identify some model variables as KPIs of the model.\n   * add abort_search() method on solver (not supported everywhere)\n   * Rework code generation to enhance performances and remove unused variables that was pointed by removed expressions.\n   * add possibility to add one or more CpoSolverListener to put some callback functions\n     when solve is started, ended, or when a solution is found.\n     Implementation is provided in new python module ``docplex.cp.solver.solver_listener`` that also contains sample\n     listeners SolverProgressPanelListener and AutoStopListener.\n   * Using parameter *context.solver.solve_with_start_next*, enable solve() method to execute a start/next loop instead\n     of standard solve. This enables, for optimization problems, usage of SolveListeners with a greater progress accuracy.\n   * Completely remove deprecated 'angel' to identify local solver.\n   * Deprecate usage of methods ``minimize()`` and ``maximize()`` on ``docplex.cp.CpoModel``. \n   * Add methods ``get_objective_bounds()`` and ``get_objective_gaps()`` in solution objects.\n\n  \n  \nChanged in 2.3.44 (2017.09):\n````````````````````````````\n\n* Module ``docplex.cp.model.solver_angel.py`` has been renamed ``solver_local.py``. \n  A shadow copy with previous name still exist to preserve ascending compatibility.\n  Module ``docplex.cp.model.config.py`` is modified to refer this new module.\n* Class ``docplex.cp.model.solver_local.SolverAngel`` has been renamed ``SolverLocal``. \n  A shadow copy with previous name still exist to preserve ascending compatibility.\n* Class ``docplex.cp.model.solver_local.AngelException`` has been renamed ``LocalSolverException``. \n  A shadow copy with previous name still exist to preserve ascending compatibility.\n* Functions logical_and() and logical_or() are able to accept a list of model boolean expressions.\n* Fix defect on allowed_assignments() and forbiden_assignments() that was wrongly converting \n  list of tupes into tuple_set.\n* Update all examples to add comments and split them in sections data / prepare / model / solve\n* Add new sched_RCPSPMM_json.py example that reads data from JSON file instead of raw data file.\n* Rename all visu examples with more explicit names.\n* Remove the object class CpoTupleSet. Tuple sets can be constructed only by calling tuple_set() method, or more\n  simply by passing directly a Python iterable of iterables when a tupleset is required \n  (in expressions allowed_assignments() and forbidden_assignments)\n* Allow logical_and() and logical_or() to accept a list of boolean expressions.\n* Add overloading of builtin functions all() and any() as other form of logical_and() and logical_or().\n* In no_overlap() and state_function(), transition matrix can be passed directly as a Python iterable of iterables of integers, \n* Editable transition matrix, created with a size only, is deprecated. However it is still available for ascending compatibility.\n* Add conditional() modeling function\n* Parameter 'AutomaticReplay' is deprecated.\n* Add get_search_status() and get_stop_cause() on object CpoSolveResult, available for solver COS12.8\n* Improved performance of ``Var.reduced_cost()`` in ``docplex.mp``.\n\nChanged in 2.2.34 (2017.07):\n````````````````````````````\n\n* Methods ``docplex.cp.model.export_model()`` and ``docplex.cp.model.import_model()``\n  have been added to respectively generate or parse a model in CPO format.\n* Methods ``docplex.cp.model.minimize()`` and ``docplex.cp.model.maximize()``\n  have been added to directly indicate an objective at model level.\n* Notebook example ``scheduling_tuto.ipynb`` contains an extensive tutorial\n  to solve scheduling problems with CP.\n* Modeling methof sum() now supports sum of cumul expressions.\n* Methods ``docplex.cp.model.start_search()`` allows to start a new \n  search sequence directly from the model object.\n* When setting ``context.solver.auto_publish`` is set, and using the CPLEX\n  engine, KPIs and current objective are automatically published when the\n  script is run on DOcplexcloud Python worker.\n* When setting ``context.solver.auto_publish`` is set, and using the CP\n  engine, current objective is automatically published when the\n  script is run on DOcplexcloud Python worker.\n* ``docplex.util.environment.Environment.set_stop_callback`` and\n  ``docplex.util.environment.Environment.get_stop_callback`` are added so that\n  you can add a callback when the DOcplexcloud job is aborted.\n\n\nChanged in 2.1.28:\n``````````````````\n\n* New methods ``Model.logical_or()`` and ``Model.logical_and()`` handle\n  logical operations on binary variables.\n* DOcplex now supports CPLEX 12.7.1 and Benders decomposition. Set annotations\n  on constraints and variables using the ``benders_annotation`` property and use\n  the proper CPLEX parameters governing Benders decomposition.\n* CPLEX tutorials: in the documentation and as notebooks in the examples.\n* Fixed a bug in ``docplex.mp.solution.SolveSolution.display()`` and in \n  ``docplex.mp.solution.Model.report_kpi()`` when using unicode variable names.\n* There's now a simple command line interface for DOcplexcloud. It can be run\n  in a terminal. ``python -m docplex.cli help`` for more info. That command\n  line reads your DOcplexcloud credentials in your cplex_config.py file. It\n  allows you to submit, list, delete jobs on DOcplexcloud. The cli is available\n  in notebooks too, using the ``%docplex_cli`` magics. ``%docplex_cli help`` for\n  some help. In a notebook, credentials can be passed using `%docplex_url` and\n  `%docplex_key` magics.\n* Removing constraints in 1 call\n* Bug fixes when editing an existing model.\n* Bug fix in the relaxation mechanism when using docplexcloud.\n\n\nChanged in 2.0.15:\n``````````````````\n\n* Piecewise linear (PWL) functions are now supported. An API is now available\n  on ``docplex.mp.model`` to create PWL functions and to create constraints using these PWL functions.\n  PWL functions may be defined with breakpoints (default API) or by using slopes. Some simple arithmetic is\n  also available to build new PWL functions by adding, subtracting, or scaling existing PWL functions.\n* DOcplex has undergone a significant overhaul effort that has resulted in an average of 30-50% improvement\n  of modeling run-time performance. All parts of the API benefit from the performance improvements: creation of variables and constraints, removal of constraints, computation of sums of variables, and so on.\n* Constraints are now fully editable: \n  the expressions of a constraint can be modified.\n  Similarly, the objective expression can also be modified. This allows for complex workflows in which the model is modified after a solve and then solved again. \n* docplex is now available on Anaconda cloud and can be installed via the conda installation packager.\n  See the `IBM Anaconda home <https://anaconda.org/IBMDecisionOptimization>`_\n  CPLEX Community Edition for Python is also provided on Anaconda Cloud to get free local solving capabilities with limitations.\n* Support of ``~/.docplexrc`` configuration files for ``docplex.mp.context.Context`` is now dropped.\n  This feature has been deprecated since 1.0.0.\n* Known incompatibility: class ``docplex.mp.model.AbstractModel`` moved to ``docplex.mp.absmodel.AbstractModel``. \n  Samples using this class have been updated.\n\n\nChanged in 1.0.630:\n```````````````````\n\n* Added support for CPLEX 12.7 and Python 3.5.\n* Upgraded the DOcplexcloud client to version 1.0.202.\n* Module ``docplex.mp.advmodel`` is now officially supported. This module\n  provides support for efficient, specialized aggregator methods for large\n  models.\n* When solving on DOcplexcloud, proxies can now be specified with the\n  ``context.solver.docloud.proxies`` property.\n* When two constraints are defined with the same name, issue a warning instead of\n  a fatal exception. The last constraint defined will take over the first one in the name directory.\n* Fix ValueError when passing a pandas DataFrame as variable keys (using\n  DataFrame indexes).\n* Solution.get_values() returns a collection of variable values in one call.\n* ``docplex.mp.model`` no longer imports ``docloud.status``. Any status\n  previously initialized as ``JobSolveStatus.UNKNOWN`` is now initialized as\n  ``None``.\n* Minor improvements to notebooks and examples.\n\n",
