    "description": "===================\nPackage: Repackage\n===================\n\nLaurent Franceschetti\nMarch/June 2013 - 2017\nMIT License.\n\nPurpose\n===========\nThis module allows any Python program to call a non-registered package in a reliable way. With this module, you may call \"non-official\" repositories, including with relative paths.\n\n**CAUTION:** *This form is an alternative to system of relative paths for\npython imports\n([PEP 328](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328/#rationale-for-relative-imports))\nand as such it is largely redundant. It can, however, be interesting because\nit shows how such a problem could be solved.*\n\n\nInstall\n=======\nIf you are using pip:\n::\n\n   pip install repackage\n\nThe problem\n===========\nIn Python, registered packages are called by name in import instructions,\nand lower directories may be treated for all purposes as packages.\n\nTwo practical problems arise:\na) How to easily call unregistered packages which have been dumped\nin an adjacent directory?\nb) How to easily move python files into a sub-directory without messing up\nthe import statements?\n\nThere are complicated issues with relative imports (see PEP366). The basic idea\nhere is to add the source directory of the package to the lib path (thanks to\na call to sys.path.append).\n\nBut the probem, is how to programmatically find the source directory, from a\nrelative path?\n\nTwo often advocated methods to determine the path are:\na. from current directory or\nb. from __FILE__ .\n\nBoth those methods have a flaw:\n  * The first does not take into account the file where the import is made,\n    hence will fail if the project is using more than one directory.\n  * The second does not allow to delegate those operations to a module that\n    would handle those issues (as __FILE__ is going to point now to point to\n    the module and not the caller).\n\nThe solution\n============\nThis package uses a simple strategy that is likely to work\nin a good range of cases: it inspects the stack to determine which file\nis the caller and works out the relative path from there.\nThe only delicate part consisted in working out how many\nsteps down the stack this is, but the answer should be invariant and\ncan be computed both by reasoning and by trial and error (in this case: 3).\n\nUsage\n=====\nSituation 1) Moving the files into a lower directory. From the module you want to make the call, just use the following statement\nbefore the imports:\n::\n\n\timport repackage\n\trepackage.up()\n\nIt should work without changing the imports that were previously\npointing to the upper directory.\n\nIf it's two directories up, write:\n::\n\n  \timport repackage\n\trepackage.up(2)\n\nSituation 2) Calling a non-registered directory somewhere else (absolute or relative path):\n::\n\n\timport repackage\n\trepackage.add(\"../../otherdir\")\n\nClearly, repackage.up() would be equivalent to repackage.add(\"..\") .\nI prefer the first because it is more terse and syntactically more robust.\n\n\nLimitations\n===========\nIf at some points in the execution, you attempt to add\nseveral times the same directory to the lib path, this should remain without\neffect (this is a feature of sys.path.append).\n\nThis module has worked reliably for a while, so it is a beta version.\nThe method seems robust so far, but not all ins and outs\nhave been explored. One precaution might be to ensure that the repackaging\nalways points to the same source directory of a package\n(not to subdirectories of the same package), so as to avoid possible\nambiguities in the lib path. (If this really turned out to be a problem,\nthis could be checked on the fly and a warning issued?).\n\nIf you find bugs, or even find this approach useless, essentially flawed or against the Zen of Python, I will be glad to hear about it.\nSimilarly, if you liked it or have ideas on how to improve it, let me know.",
