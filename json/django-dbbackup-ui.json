    "description": "# Django Database Backup UI\n\nDjango Database Backup UI is an extension of Django Database Backup (django-dbbackup: https://github.com/django-dbbackup/django-dbbackup) that allows you to backup database and media files via Django Admin interface. An additional dbbackup_ui.wagtail module provides support for Wagtail Admin.\n\n## Supported versions\n  * Django: 1.11\n  * Wagtail: 1.10\n  * Python: 3.4+\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall using PIP:\n\n  `pip install django-dbbackup-ui`\n\n### Regular Django Admin:\n\n1. Add **dbbackup_ui** to INSTALLED_APPS:\n\n  `INSTALLED_APPS += ['dbbackup_ui']`\n\n2. Add url to your main **urls.py** just above root admin url:\n\n ```\n  urlpatterns = [\n    url(r'^admin/backups/', include('dbbackup_ui.urls')),\n    url(r'^admin/', include(wagtailadmin_urls)),\n  ]\n  ```\n\n3. Granted you're logged in as a Superuser you should now be able to access the backup page via url:\n  _http://example.com/admin/backups/backup-database-and-media/_\n\n\n### Wagtail Admin:\n\n1. If you use dbbackup_ui with Wagtail, add **dbbackup_ui.wagtail** to INSTALLED_APPS:\n\n  `INSTALLED_APPS += ['dbbackup_ui.wagtail']`\n\n2. Granted you're logged in as a Superuser you should now be able to access the backup page via url:\n  _http://example.com/admin/backup-database-and-media/_\nAdditionally, you should see a new menu item labeled Backup DB & Media in the navigation sidebar on the left.\n\n\n## Usage\nWhen on **Backup Database and Media** page, you should see two buttons: \"Download database backup\" and \"Download media backup\". By clicking on one of these buttons, a backup process starts and eventually, a backup file gets downloaded by your browser. Please be advised that clicking on the buttons doesn't create a backup on the server. If you need to create server stored backups, you should use command-line and commands provided by django-dbbackup module.\n\nThis extension allows to make a quick backup and get it downloaded to your computer. Don't use this tool if you have large database dumps and / or lots of media. This tool is suitable for small installations.\n\nAlso, remember about possible security risks due to exposing backup capabilities to web interfaces. Use at your own risk.\n\n\n# History\n\n0.1.5 (2017-06-02)\n------------------\n* First release on PyPI.\n",
