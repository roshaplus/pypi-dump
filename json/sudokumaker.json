    "description": "Sudoku Maker\n============\n\n:Author: Ralf Schlatterbeck <rsc@runtux.com>\n\nSudoku Maker is a generator for Sudoku number puzzles. It uses a genetic\nalgorithm internally, so it can serve as an introduction to genetic\nalgorithms. The generated Sudokus are usually very hard to solve -- good\nfor getting rid of a Sudoku addiction (or maybe not).\n\nIt also includes a simple depth-first solver for sudoku puzzles -- the\nsolver is internally needed when generating sudoku puzzles. The included\n``sudoku.py`` can be called and reads a sudoku from standard input.\nIt outputs the solution (if any) or if there isn't a single solution to\nthe given puzzle it will output several (up to a maximum).\n\nThe representation of sudoku puzzles is a simple: 9 lines with 9 numbers\nin each line, e.g., ::\n\n    300000500\n    000000260\n    000308000\n    000000091\n    400100000\n    037000000\n    800006000\n    006485700\n    000009002\n\nThe numbers 1-9 represent the given numbers of the puzzle while the\nzeros represent the empty tiles. A solved puzzle simply contains no\nzeros.\n\nThere are two variants of sudoku puzzles supported. The first variant\nadds the diagonals (so in each of the two diagonals the numbers 1-9 must\nbe present), this variant can be requested with the ``--diagonal``\noption. The sudoku maker currently doesn't support the variants.\nThe second variant requires that in each quadrant there are 9 distinct\ncolors, the same color is always at the same position in each quadrant.\nThe numbers 1-9 must be present on each of the colors.\n\nSudoku puzzles can be pretty-printed as LaTeX using the included\n``sudoku_as_tex`` program. This currently supports printing the\ndiagonals in yellow if the ``--diagonal`` option is given. Color\nprinting for the second variant of sudoku puzzles is not yet supported.\n\nFor the genetic algorithm library, my python wrapper *pgapy* of the\nparallel genetic algorithm library (pgapack) is needed. There is\ncurrently no Windows support for *pgapy* as it requires the pgapack\nlibrary to be installed. For a skilled person it should be possible to\nget pgapack running on Windows, so if you're doing this, let me know.\n\nVersion 0.4: Packaging fixes\n\nFix package name again, stick to sudokumaker to avoid name collisions.\n\n - Package namespace is now sudokumaker again\n - Sudokumaker depends on rsclib.sourceforge.net\n\nVersion 0.3: Color, Diagonal\n\nNow color constrained and diagonality constrained sudokus are supported.\n\n - Diagonality constrained sudokus must have the digits 1-9 in the\n   diagonals, too. When printing, diagonals are printed in yellow.\n - Color constrained sudokus have 9 additional colors which are in the\n   same position in every quadrant. These must have the digits 1-9, too.\n   When printing we chose 9 different light colors.\n\nVersion 0.2: README update\n\nThe README (and the SF homepage which is generated from it) had wrong\nlink to the project. Also the python package index didn't accept one of\nmy classifier. Grmpf.\n\n - Fix project link in README (SF Logo)\n - Remove one classifier not accepted by pypi\n\nVersion 0.1: Initial Release\n\nSudoku Maker is a generator for Sudoku number puzzles. It uses a genetic\nalgorithm internally.\n\n - First Release after a long silent development",
