Generated files will work with Firefox 3.5\nand above, with full featured support in Firefox 3.6b3 and above.\nCompatibility with other browsers is unlikely.  Spiffy features\nof this package include resizing, two-column layouts, parallel incremental \nreveals of text and graphic overlays (or parallel-column text blocks).\nThe code is a mashup of the docutils S5 module and Christian\nEffenberger's \"S5 1.3 reloaded\" product.",
