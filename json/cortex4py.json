    "description": "|Join the chat at https://gitter.im/TheHive-Project/TheHive|\n\nCortex4py\n=========\n\nCortex4py is a Python API client for\n`Cortex <https://thehive-project.org/>`__, a powerful observable\nanalysis engine where observables such as IP and email addresses, URLs,\ndomain names, files or hashes can be analyzed one by one using a Web\ninterface.\n\nCortex4py allows analysts to automate these operations and submit\nobservables in bulk mode through the Cortex REST API from alternative\nSIRP platforms, custom scripts or MISP.\n\nCaution - WIP\n=============\n\nCortex4py is considered work in progress. It is considered *beta*\nsoftware though we are using it on a regular basis for the use case\noutlined above. It should be sufficient in most situations where you\nneed to interact with `Cortex's REST\nAPI <https://github.com/CERT-BDF/CortexDocs/blob/master/api/README.md>`__.\nIf not, please feel free to contribute and submit pull requests or\n`request missing\nfeatures <https://github.com/CERT-BDF/Cortex4py/issues/new>`__ if you\nare not comfortable with Python.\n\nUse It\n======\n\nOn macOS and Linux, type:\n\n::\n\n    sudo pip install cortex4py\n\nFollowing is an example of a python script that runs an analysis using\nMaxMind analyzer\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import sys\n    import json\n    from cortex4py.api import CortexApi\n    from cortex4py.api import CortexException\n\n    api = CortexApi('http://127.0.0.1:9000')\n\n    # Run analysis\n    job_id = None\n    try:\n        response = api.run_analyzer(\"MaxMind_GeoIP_3_0\", \"ip\", 1, \"8.8.8.8\")\n        job_id = response[\"id\"]\n    except CortexException as ex:\n        print('[ERROR]: Failed to run analyzer: {}'.format(ex.message))\n        sys.exit(0)\n\n    # Get the job report\n    try:\n        response = api.get_job_report(job_id, '30s')\n        print(json.dumps(response, indent=4, sort_keys=True))\n    except CortexException as ex:\n        print('[ERROR]: Failed to get job report'.format(ex.message))\n        sys.exit(0)\n\nIf you are using Python on a Windows operating system, please forgo the\n``sudo`` command.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nCortex4py is an open source and free software released under the\n`AGPL <https://github.com/CERT-BDF/Cortex4py/blob/master/LICENSE>`__\n(Affero General Public License). We, TheHive Project, are committed to\nensure that Cortex4py will remain a free and open source project on the\nlong-run.\n\nUpdates\n=======\n\nInformation, news and updates are regularly posted on `TheHive Project\nTwitter account <https://twitter.com/thehive_project>`__ and on `the\nblog <https://blog.thehive-project.org/>`__.\n\nContributing\n============\n\nWe welcome your contributions. Please feel free to fork the code, play\nwith it, make some patches and send us pull requests using\n`issues <https://github.com/CERT-BDF/Cortex4py/issues>`__.\n\nWe do have a `Code of conduct <code_of_conduct.md>`__. Make sure to\ncheck it out before contributing.\n\nSupport\n=======\n\nPlease `open an issue on\nGitHub <https://github.com/CERT-BDF/Cortex4py/issues/new>`__ if you'd\nlike to report a bug or request a feature. We are also available on\n`Gitter <https://gitter.im/TheHive-Project/TheHive>`__ to help you out.\n\nIf you need to contact the project team, send an email to\nsupport@thehive-project.org.\n\nCommunity Discussions\n=====================\n\nWe have set up a Google forum at\nhttps://groups.google.com/a/thehive-project.org/d/forum/users.
