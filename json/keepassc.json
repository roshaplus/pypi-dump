    "description": "KeePassC v.1.7.0\n================\n\n* License: GPL v3 or later\n* Author: Karsten-Kai K\u00f6nig <grayfox@outerhaven.de>\n** License of editor.py: MIT\n** Author of editor.py: Scott Hansen <firecat four one five three at gmail dot com>\n** Github: https://github.com/firecat53/py_curses_editor\n* Stable download: https://github.com/raymontag/keepassc/tarball/master\n* Website: http://raymontag.github.com/keepassc\n* Bug tracker: https://github.com/raymontag/keepassc/issues?state=open\n* Git: git://github.com/raymontag/keepassc.git\n\nFeatures:\n---------\nKeePassC is a password manager fully compatible to KeePass v.1.x and KeePassX. That is, your\npassword database is fully encrypted with AES.\n\nKeePassC is written in Python 3 and comes with a curses-interface. It is completely controlled\nwith the keyboard.\n\nSince v.1.6.0 network usage is implemented.\n\nInstall:\n--------\n\nFirst check if Python 3 is executed on your system with 'python' (e.g. ArchLinux) or with 'python3' (e.g. Fedora). If the latter applies open bin/keepassc with an editor of your choice and edit the first line to '#!/usr/bin/env python3', if the former do nothing.\n\nIf all dependencies are fulfilled type 'python setup.py install' resp. 'python3 setup.py install' in the root directory of KeePassC.\n\nFurthermore check if the directory /var/empty exists (normally it should but it seems that is doesn't on Debian and derivates). If not execute as root user 'mkdir -m 755 /var/empty'.\n\nSome users had problems to install PyCrypto in the right way on Ubuntu. Maybe this bash-script could help (written for Debian/Ubuntu like system; thx to iwfmp):\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [[ -z `command -v keepassc` ]]; then\n  sudo apt-get build-dep python-crypto\n  githubRepos=\"dlitz/pycrypto raymontag/kppy raymontag/keepassc\"\n  for githubRepo in $githubRepos; do\n    repoName=`echo ${githubRepo} | awk -F/ '{print $2}'`\n    repoLocation=/usr/local/src/${repoName}\n    sudo git clone https://github.com/${githubRepo} $repoLocation\n    cd $repoLocation\n    sudo python3 setup.py build\n    sudo python3 setup.py install\n  done\nfi\n\nUsage:\n------\nStart the program with 'keepassc'. To get help type 'F1' while KeePassC is executed and you will see usage\ninformation to the current window (not in main menu).\n\nFor a short introduction have a look at http://raymontag.github.com/keepassc/docu.html. Also use 'man keepassc'.\n\nFor help using the server have a look at http://raymontag.github.com/keepassc/server.html, 'man keepassc-server' and 'man keepassc-agent'.\n\nYou can get help at any time by pressing F1 in the file or database browser.\n\nDependencies:\n-------------\n\n* Python 3 (>= 3.3)\n* kppy http://www.nongnu.org/kppy\n* xsel (optional but necessary if you want to copy usernames and passwords to clipboard)  http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/\n* A POSIX-compatible operating system\n\nCopyright (C) 2012-2015 Karsten-Kai K\u00f6nig <grayfox@outerhaven.de>\n\nKeePassC is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms\nof the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,\neither version 3 of the License, or at your option) any later version.\n\nKeePassC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY\nWARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR\nA PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
