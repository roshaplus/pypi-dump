    "description": "pyATS Connections Component\n===========================\n\npyATS is an end-to-end testing ecosystem, specializing in data-driven and \nreusable testing, and engineered to be suitable for Agile, rapid development \niterations. Extensible by design, pyATS enables developers start with small, \nsimple and linear test cases, and scale towards large, complex and asynchronous \ntest suites.\n\npyATS is initially developed internally in Cisco, and is now available to the\ngeneral public starting late 2017 through `Cisco DevNet`_. Visit the pyATS\nhome page at\n\n    https://developer.cisco.com/site/pyats/\n\n.. _Cisco DevNet: https://developer.cisco.com/\n\n\nConnections Package\n-------------------\n\nThis is a sub-component of pyATS that enables scripts to talk to various network\ndevices. It provides the top level abstraction and interface to enable \ndevelopers to create their own connection classes.\n\nBy default, this also installs Cisco Unicon package.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\npyATS currently supports Python 3.4+ on Linux & Mac systems. Windows platforms\nare not yet supported.\n\nQuick Start\n-----------\n\n.. code-block:: console\n    \n    # install pyats as a whole\n    $ pip install pyats\n\n    # to upgrade this package manually\n    $ pip install --upgrade pyats.connections\n\n    # to install alpha/beta versions, add --pre\n    $ pip isntall --pre pyats.connections\n\nFor more information on setting up your Python development environment,\nsuch as creating virtual environment and installing ``pip`` on your system, \nplease refer to `Virtual Environment and Packages`_ in Python tutorials.\n\n.. _Virtual Environment and Packages: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html",
