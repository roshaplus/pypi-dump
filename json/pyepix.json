    "description": "Pyepix_ is a wrapper package for the ePiX_ mathematical plotting library. The\nePiX_ library supports C++ programs for creating mathematically accurate plots for use in LaTeX documents.\nPyepix_ provides a Python wrapper to this library thus allowing integration with Python's extensive\nbuilt-in library and extension packages. In addition, Pyepix_ frees the user from needing to learn C++,\nobtaining a C++ compiler, and fighting with the C++ language.\n\n.. _Pyepix: http://claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu/~steriana/Python\n.. _ePiX: http://mathcs.holycross.edu/~ahwang/current/ePiX.html",
