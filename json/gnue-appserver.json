    "description": "GNUe AppServer is the core of the n-tier variant of the GNU Enterprise system.\r\nTo the front end (be it GNUe Forms, GNUe Reports or any other tool), it\r\nprovides user-defineable business objects with arbitary fields and methods.\r\nWhile transforming access to those fields and methods into database\r\ncommunication and calling of scripts, it cares about stability, security,\r\nspeed, and consistency.",
