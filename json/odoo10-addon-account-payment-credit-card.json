Go to Accounting > Purchases > Vendors Bills\n#. Select an open bill and click on Register Payment\n#. Select the credit card journal and validate the payment\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/96/10.0\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/account-payment/issues>`_.
