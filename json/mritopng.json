    "description": "`mritopng` - Convert DICOM Files to PNG\n=======================================\n\n|Build Status| |License|_\n\nA simple python module to make it easy to batch convert a binary DICOM file, which is usually an output from\nan MRI scan to a PNG image.\n\nThe MRI scanning facilities hand you a CD containing your MRI scans. This CD will typically not contain\nany image files that can be opened up by your default image viewing program. The CD contains a list of DICOM files,\nwhich can only be viewed by the included viewer, which is mostly only supported on a Windows machine.\n\nThis module should help you convert all the DICOM based scans to PNG files.\n\nImportant\n---------\n\nThe software shows you additional meta data about the patient and the\npositioning of the scan on top the scanned image. This *will not* display that information\non the PNG file.\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://circleci.com/gh/danishm/mritopng.svg?style=shield&circle-token=:circle-token=fdde06fc18401432d1cd84538a88678dd81584ad\n.. |License| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg\n.. _License: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT",
