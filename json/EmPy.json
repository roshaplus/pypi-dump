    "description": "EmPy is a system for embedding Python expressions and statements in\ntemplate text; it takes an EmPy source file, processes it, and\nproduces output. This is accomplished via expansions, which are\nspecial signals to the EmPy system and are set off by a special prefix\n(by default the at sign, @). EmPy can expand arbitrary Python\nexpressions and statements in this way, as well as a variety of\nspecial forms. Textual data not explicitly delimited in this way is\nsent unaffected to the output, allowing Python to be used in effect as\na markup language. Also supported are callbacks via hooks, recording\nand playback via diversions, and dynamic, chainable filters. The\nsystem is highly configurable via command line options and embedded\ncommands.",
