    "description": "The anonymizing relay monitor (arm) is a terminal status monitor for Tor, intended for command-line aficionados, ssh connections, and anyone with a tty terminal. This works much like top does for system usage, providing real time statistics for:\r\n\r\n* bandwidth, cpu, and memory usage\r\n* relay's current configuration\r\n* logged events\r\n* connection details (ip, hostname, fingerprint, and consensus data)\r\n* ... etc\r\n\r\nThis is being renamed from arm to seth in its next release to avoid confusion with the processor.",
