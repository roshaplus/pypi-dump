    "description": "DAQ Server\n==========\n\nThis a server that provides remote access to a `National Instruments DAQ`_ (data\nacquisition device) for power measurement.  National Instruments provide DAQ\ndrivers only for Windows and for very specific (old) Linux kernels. This package\nallows DAQs to be usable from other operating systems. \n\nThe idea is that the DAQ is connected to a machine running an OS for which\ndrivers are available; that machine is also running the server component of this\npackage. A program or a script running on a different OS can then use the client\npart of this package to configure and collect measurements from that DAQ.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n::\n\n        sudo -H pip install daqpower\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nPlease refer to `DAQ setup documentation <http://pythonhosted.org/wlauto/daq_device_setup.html>`_\nfor WA.\n\n.. note:: This package was previously distributed as part of `ARM Workload\n          Automation`_.\n\n\n.. _National Instruments DAQ: http://www.ni.com/data-acquisition/\n.. _ARM Workload Automation: https://github.com/ARM-software/workload-automation\n",
