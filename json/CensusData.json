    "description": "This package is designed to provide easy access to the U.S. Census Bureau's API (https://www.census.gov/developers/)\nin Python. Currently, this package only supports data from the most recent\n(2015) American Community Survey (ACS) 1- and 5-year estimates. I plan to add\nsupport for other years of ACS data, as well as 3-year estimates (which were\ndiscontinued but were produced in the past). I also plan to add support\nfor other Census data sources, starting with the decennial census.\n\nThe American Community Survey (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/)\nstarted in 2005. It produces estimates\nbased on survey samples, and replaces the old Census long form. It\nprovides period estimates, e.g., the 2011-2015 5-year estimates provide\nestimates for community characteristics during that entire period. The\n5-year estimates are not averages of 1-year estimates. The 5-year estimates\nare more precise than the 1-year estimates, and are available for smaller\ncommunities than the 1-year estimates, because they are based on more\ndata. The ACS provides data on a wide variety of demographic, economic,\nhousing, commuting, income, and related variables for communities\nacross the United States, down to the block group level and up\nto the national level.\n\nThere are a number of facilities available for downloading Census\ndata, including American FactFinder, the ACS summary files,\nand the Census DataFerrett. This package is designed to provide\nthe following features not available elsewhere:\n\n* Easy download of specific variables across a variety of tables, downloading only the variables you need for the geographies of interest to you. This bypasses data processing hassles associated with working with other sources like the ACS Summary Files.\n* Access to the exact variables of interest, with variable names making it easy to look up further information on the source tables or to pull up other years of data. This facilitates work by more technical users.\n* Download data for multiple geographies at once, such as all counties in the United States, or all block groups in Illinois.\n* Work with the data as a Pandas data frame, or export to CSV for analysis in other data analysis packages.",
