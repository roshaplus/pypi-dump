    "description": "This package is designed to provide easy access to the U.S. Census Bureau's\nAPI (https://www.census.gov/developers/) in Python. It supports pulling data\nfrom the American Community Survey (ACS) and the Census Summary File,\nspecifically:\n\n* ACS 5-year estimates (2005-2009 to 2011-2015),\n* ACS 1-year estimates (2012-2015),\n* ACS 3-year estimates (2010-2012 to 2011-2013),\n* ACS 1-year supplemental estimates (2014-2015),\n* Census 2010 Summary File 1.\n\nThis package handles the details of interacting with the Census API for you,\nso that you can focus on working with the data. It provides a class for\nrepresenting Census geographies. It also provides functions\nfor gaining further information about specific variables and tables and\nfor searching for variables. Full documentation is available at\nhttps://jtleider.github.io/censusdata/.\n\nThe ACS (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/)\nstarted in 2005. It provides information on a wide range of social, economic,\ndemographic, and housing characteristics. Topics covered include\nincome, employment, health insurance, the age distribution, education, among\nmany others. The ACS replaces the old Census long form, which used to be\ndistributed to a subset of households responding to the decennial Census.\nThe ACS produces survey-based period estimates. For instance, the\n5-year 2011-2015 estimates are based on data collected during all 5 years.\nThey are not simply an aggregate of 1-year estimates, and overlapping\n5-year estimates (e.g., 2008-2012 and 2011-2015) should *not* be compared.\nThe ACS provides margins of error to accompany all estimates. Margins of\nerror are smaller for estimates based on more years of data.\n\nACS 5-year estimates are the least current but provide the greatest precision\nand are available for geographies of all sizes\n(https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/estimates.html). By\ncontrast, 1-year estimates are the most current but the least precise and are\nonly available for geographies with populations of 65,000+.\nIn between are the 1-year supplemental estimates or, in past years, the\n3-year estimates, both of which are for geographies with populations of\n20,000+. The choice of which ACS estimates to use will depend on your needs\nfor current data vs. data for a variety of geographies with greater\nprecision.\n\nThe decennial Census counts every resident of the United States. The 2010\nCensus Summary File 1 provides information about each community's population,\nincluding age, sex, and race distributions, as well as information\non households and families. (Summary File 2 provides additional data\nfor specific racial/ethnic groups.)\n\nThere are a number of facilities available for downloading Census\ndata, including American FactFinder, the ACS summary files,\nand the Census DataFerrett. This package is designed to provide\nthe following features not available elsewhere:\n\n* Easy download of specific variables across a variety of tables, downloading only the variables you need for the geographies of interest to you. This bypasses data processing hassles associated with working with other sources like the ACS Summary Files.\n* Access to the exact variables of interest, with variable names making it easy to look up further information on the source tables or to pull up other years of data. This facilitates work by more technical users.\n* Download data for multiple geographies at once, such as all counties in the United States, or all block groups in Illinois.\n* Work with the data as a Pandas data frame, or export to CSV for analysis in other data analysis packages.",
