    "description": "Dunshire is a `CVXOPT <http://cvxopt.org/>`_-based library for solving\nlinear (cone) games. The notion of a symmetric linear (cone) game was\nintroduced by Gowda and Ravindran in *On the game-theoretic value of a\nlinear transformation relative to a self-dual cone*. I've extended\ntheir results to asymmetric cones and two interior points in my\nthesis, which does not exist yet.\n\nThe main idea can be gleaned from Gowda and Ravindran, however.\nAdditional details and our problem formulation can be found in the\nfull Dunshire documentation. The state-of-the-art is that only\nsymmetric games can be solved efficiently, and thus the linear games\nsupported by Dunshire are a compromise between the two: the cones are\nsymmetric, but the players get to choose two interior points.\n\nOnly the nonnegative orthant and the ice-cream cone are supported at\nthe moment. The symmetric positive-semidefinite cone is coming soon.",
