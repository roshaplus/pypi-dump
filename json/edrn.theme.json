    "description": "**********\nedrn.theme\n**********\n\nThis is the basic look-and-feel for websites for the Early Detection Research\nNetwork (EDRN_), which loosely follows the style of the National Cancer\nInstitute (NCI_).  It was developed by the Informatics Center (IC_), operated\nby JPL_.\n\nAlthough intended for the EDRN public portal, this package may be used in any\nPlone_ 3 (or later) site.\n\n.. References:\n.. _EDRN: http://edrn.nci.nih.gov/\n.. _IC: http://cancer.jpl.nasa.gov/\n.. _JPL: http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/\n.. _NCI: http://www.cancer.gov/\n.. _Plone: http://plone.org/\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nUse Buildout_ with the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe.\n\n* Add ``edrn.theme`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::\n \n    [buildout]\n    ...\n    eggs =\n        ...\n        edrn.theme\n        \n* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::\n  \n    [instance]\n    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance\n    ...\n    zcml =\n        edrn.theme\n        \n* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::\n  \n    % ./bin/buildout\n        \nYou can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package\nfrom another package's configure.zcml file.\n\n.. References:\n.. _Buildout: http://www.buildout.org/\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\nWhat follows is a history of changes from release to release.  For issue IDs\nmentioned below, you can learn more about them by visiting the issue tracker\nat https://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CA.\n\n\n1.2.6 \u2014 Obeyance\n----------------\n\n\u2022 Cleans up packaging and obeys PEP-470.\n\u2022 Uses Travis-CI's new container infrastructure with caching.\n\n\n1.2.5 \u2014 I Had Some Chicken; Pass Me the FLOSS\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\u2022 First official release as free/libre/open source software.\n\n\n1.2.4 \u2014 Quickie\n---------------\n\n\u2022 CA-1230 - Quick Links Portlets needs buttons for Informatics and Network\n  Consulting Team\n\n\n1.2.3 \u2014 MOAR UPGRADES!\n----------------------\n\n\u2022 Made compatible with Plone 4.3.\n\u2022 Use z3c.autoinclude\n\n\n1.2.2 \u2014\u00a0More Upgrades\n---------------------\n\n\u2022 Made compatible with Plone 4.2.\n\n\n1.2.1 \u2014 Upgrades\n----------------\n\n\u2022 Made compatible with Plone 4.1.5.\n\u2022 CA-983 - unencrypted login form\n\n\n1.2.0 \u2014 Plone 4.1\n-----------------\n\nThis release makes the EDRN theme compatible with Plone 4.1.  It also upgrades\nthe test harness to use the plone.app.testing fixtures.\n\nIt also repairs a long-standing issue (CA-747): the logged_out template has a\nform where you can immediately log in again if you require.  However, the\nApache circuitry sends that form out over HTTP, and the form action inherits\nthat HTTP, when it should go over HTTPS.  The EDRN theme removes the form.\n \n\n1.1.2 \u2014 Icons\n-------------\n\nThis release adds icons (and corresponding CSS) for the QuickLinks portlet,\nincluding the Collaborative Groups icon with hover effect.\n\n\n1.1.1 \u2014 Upgrade Cleanup\n-----------------------\n\nThis release includes the following:\n\n* No more horrible padding that's been appearing on the left side of virtually\n  every damn span everywhere.\n* New unit test to check for customized login_form and the new login_form.\n* Hidden labels of class hiddenStructure that are for accessibility only.\n* Making the labels on the add/remove addons list appear reasonable.\n* Bringing in customizations made TTW at NCI that worked around IE7 display\n  issues.\n* Upgrade steps to profile 4.\n\n\n1.1.0 \u2014 Plone 4\n---------------\n\nThis release makes edrn.theme compatible with Plone 4.\n\n\n1.0.3 \u2014 Dark, Darker, Darko\n---------------------------\n\nThe only issue addressed this time 'round is:\n\n* CA-729 - Change the color of the hyperlinks on the Public Portal\n\n\n1.0.2 \u2014 The Little Dutch Boy\n----------------------------\n\nThe only issue addressed by this release is:\n\n* CA-632 - Portal 3 leaks memory?\n\n\n1.0.1 \u2014 Anal Retentiveness\n--------------------------\n\nThe only issue addressed by this release is:\n\n* CA-529 - Remove \"Valid XHTML\" and \"Valid CSS\" links\n\n\n1.0.0 \u2014 Fantasizing on Facetizing\n---------------------------------\n\nAfter being in production for several months we've decided to call it version\n1 at last.  However, this release also adds styling for future faceted\nnavigation features.  It also adds styling and imagery for the Members List\nbutton for the QuickLinks portlet.\n\nIt also addresses the following issues:\n\n* CA-642 - Create a new member page\n* CA-666 - Sites Page clean up\n\nYou can learn more about this issue by visiting the Informatics Center's issue\ntracker at https://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CA.\n\n\n0.0.6 \u2014 The Eleventh Hour\n-------------------------\n\nAfter viewing the new look-and-feel for EDRN across a variety of applications,\nmanagement suddenly realizes they don't like it.  This release attempts to\nsatisfy them.  See https://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CA-599 as well as\nhttps://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CA-600 for more details.\n\n\n0.0.5 \u2014 Unknown release\n-----------------------\n\nIt's a myyyyssteeeerrry!\n\n\n0.0.4 \u2014 Small Screens Welcome\n-----------------------------\n\nThe following issues have been addressed in this release:\n\n* http://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CA-477 - Portal requires screen width\n  of 1280 to display all content\n* http://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CA-497 - Search results appearing as\n  separated from search result facet links\n\n\n0.0.3 \u2014 Quicklinks Portlet Look and Feel\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe following issues have been addressed in this release:\n\n* http://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CA-466 - Change order of links on the\n  left side menu of the portal\n\n\n0.0.2 \u2014 Modernization and Metadata\n----------------------------------\n\n* Copious work by Andrew Hart to further modernize the look and feel for EDRN.\n* Updated project metadata.\n\n\n0.0.1 \u2014 FCS\n-----------\n\nThis is a first customer ship, though it should be considered a work in\nprogress.\n\n\n0.0.0 \u2014 Unreleased\n------------------\n\nInitial release.",
