    "description": "# fastmat\n\n## Description\nScientific computing requires handling large composed or structured matrices.\nFastmat is a framework for handling large composed or structured matrices.\nIt allows expressing and using them in a mathematically intuitive way while\nstoring and handling them internally in an efficient way. This approach allows\nhuge savings in computational time and memory requirements compared to using\ndense matrix representations.\n\n### Languages\n- Python\n- Cython\n\n### Dependencies\n- Python >= 2.7 or >=3.0\n- Numpy >= 1.07\n- Scipy >= 1.08\n- Cython >= 1.18\n\n### Authors\n- Sebastian Semper - Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau, Institute for Mathematics\n- Christoph Wagner - Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau,\n\t\t\t\t\t Institute for Information Technology, EMS Group\n\n### Contact\n- sebastian.semper@tu-ilmenau.de\n- christoph.wagner@tu-ilmenau.de\n- https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/ems/\n\n## Documentation / HELP !\nPlease have a look at the documentation, which is included in the source\ndistribution at github or may be built locally on your machine by running\n    `make doc`\n\nIf you experience any trouble please do not hesitate to contact us or to open\nan issue on our github projectpage: https://github.com/EMS-TU-Ilmenau/fastmat\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Installation fails with *ImportError: No module named Cython.Build*\nSomething went wrong with resolving the dependencies of fastmat during setup.\nUnfortunately one or more of the required packages numpy, scipy or cython were\nnot installed automatically. Please do this manually by running\n    `pip install cython numpy scipy matplotlib`\nand try the installation of fastmat again.\n\n#### Issue not resolved?\nPlease contact us or leave your bug report in the *issue* section. Thank You!\n\n\n## Citation / Acknowledgements\nIf you want to use fastmat or parts of it in your private, scientific or\ncommercial project or work you are required to acknowledge visibly to all users\nthat fastmat was used for your work and put a reference to the project and the\nEMS Group at TU Ilmenau.\n\nIf you use fastmat for your scientific work you are further required to cite\nthe following publication affiliated with the project:\n- `to be announced soon. Please tune back in regularly to check on updates.`\n\n## Installation\nfastmat currently **supports both Linux and Windows**. Building the\ndocumentation and running benchmarks is currently only supported under linux\nwith windows support underway. You may choose one of these installation methods:\n\n### installation with pip: the fast and easy way\n\nfastmat is included in the Python Package Index (PyPI) and can be installed\nfrom the commandline by running one easy and straightforward command:\n    `pip install fastmat`\n\nWhen installing with pip all dependencies of the package will be installed\nalong.\n\n### installation from source: doing it manually\n- download the source distribution from our github repository:\n    https://github.com/EMS-TU-Ilmenau/fastmat/archive/master.zip\n- unpack its contents and navigate to the project root directory\n- make sure you have installed all listed dependencies with at least the\n  specified version\n- type `make install` to install fastmat on your computer\n    * If you intend to install the package locally for your user\n      type `make install MODE=--user` instead.\n    * If you only would like to compile the package to use it from this local\n      directory without installing it, type `make compile`\n\n\n## Demos\nFeel free to have a look at the demos in the `demo/` directory of the source\ndistribution. Please make sure to have fastmat already installed when running\nthese.\n\nPlease note that the edgeDetect demo requires the Python Imaging Library (PIL)\ninstalled and the SAFT demos do compile a cython-core of a user defined matrix\nclass beforehand thus having a delaying the first time they're executed.\n",
