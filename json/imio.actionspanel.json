    "description": "imio.actionspanel\n=================\n\nThis package provides a view and a sample viewlet that will display a table of different actions available on an element.\n\nBy default, so called sections available are :\n\n- transitions\n- edit\n- own delete action management\n- actions\n- addable types\n- object history\n\nTransitions :\n-------------\nThis will display different available workflow transitions and is managed by the section \"renderTransitions\".\n\nTransitions to confirm :\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nYou can specify 'transitions to confirm' by overriding the '_transitionsToConfirm' method,\nthis will display a popup when the user trigger the transition that let's him add a\ncomment and accept/cancel workflow transition triggering.\nThe '_transitionsToConfirm' method must return a tuple that specify 'object_meta_type.transition_id' and could looks like :\n\ndef _transitionsToConfirm():\n    return ('ATDocument.reject', 'ATDocument.publish', 'ATFolder.publish', 'Collection.retract', )\n\nEdit :\n------\nThis will display an edit action and his managed by the section \"renderEdit\".\n\nBy default, it is only available when useIcons is True as useIcons is supposed to be used in dashboards displaying several elements and not\non a particular element view.  On the element view, the edit action is not displayed as it is redundant with the already existing tab \"Edit\".\n\nOwn delete management :\n-----------------------\nThis own delete management is made to surround behaviour where it is necessary to delete an object to have the \"Delete objects\" permission on the parent.  Here, it will do delete work even if user does not have the permission \"Delete objects\" on the object's parent.  Just having \"Delete objects\" on the object to delete will be enough.  You can also override the adapter \"ContentDeletableAdapter\" to be able to define a \"mayDelete\" method that will do anything you want to check if current user may delete the object.  It is managed by the section \"renderOwnDelete\".\n\nActions (portal_actions.object_buttons) :\n-----------------------------------------\nThis will display different available actions coming from portal_actions.object_buttons and is managed by the section \"renderActions\".\n\nIgnorable and acceptable actions :\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nIt is possible to override the IGNORABLE_ACTIONS and ACCEPTABLE_ACTIONS so you filter existing actions and avoid to display them.\n\nIf ACCEPTABLE_ACTIONS are defined, only these action will be considered.  If IGNORABLE_ACTIONS are defined, every available\nactions will be considered except if the action id is in the IGNORABLE_ACTIONS.\n\nAddable types :\n---------------\nThis will display a combo list that will display types that are addable in the object if it is a container.  It is managed by the section \"renderAddContent\".\n\nObject history :\n----------------\nAdd a link to the object's history and will be displayed in a popup.  It is managed by the section \"renderHistory\".\n\nContributors\n============\n\n- IMIO, dev@imio.be\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.32 (2018-01-06)\n-----------------\n\n- Added possibility to define a target on the edit action. To do this,\n  pass the value for `edit_action_target` in the kwargs.\n  [sgeulette]\n\n1.31 (2017-11-10)\n-----------------\n\n- Added icon on object buttons.\n  [sgeulette]\n- Added separate external edit button\n  [sgeulette]\n\n1.30 (2017-10-03)\n-----------------\n\n- Rely on `collective.fingerpointing` for logging capabilities, this replace the\n  log message when an element is deleted.\n  [gbastien]\n- Call `transaction.abort` when an error occurs during deletion in\n  `DeleteGivenUidView` to avoid leaving portal in an unconsitent state.\n  [gbastien]\n\n1.29 (2017-08-30)\n-----------------\n\n- Trigger JS event `ap_delete_givenuid` when an element is removed from a\n  faceted page.\n  [gbastien]\n- Only show the actions panel viewlet on the view of the element, not on the\n  other templates like `folder_contents` because it also displays buttons and\n  user could be confused about that.\n  [gbastien]\n- Use same class `apButton` for buttons and select (add content) displayed on\n  the actions panel viewlet.\n  [gbastien]\n\n1.28 (2017-05-24)\n-----------------\n\n- Added parameter `catch_before_delete_exception=True` to the\n  `DeleteGivenUidView`.  By default it will catch `BeforeDeleteException`\n  but when set to False, it will not be catch it.  This let's catch\n  the exception in another method.\n  [gbastien]\n- Call `reindexObject` when the BeforeDeleteException is catched because at\n  this moment, object has already been unindexed.\n  [gbastien]\n\n1.27 (2017-05-10)\n-----------------\n\n- Use api.adopt_roles rather than create a super user to execute a \"own\" delete\n  action.\n  [sdelcourt]\n- Use plone.api.\n  [gbastien]\n- Pass `**kwargs` to ContentDeletableAdapter.mayDelete.\n  [gbastien]\n\n1.26 (2017-04-13)\n-----------------\n\n- Make sure action title is translated.\n  [gbastien]\n\n1.25 (2017-03-22)\n-----------------\n\n- Display the description of actions while displayed as input.\n  [gbastien]\n\n1.24 (2017-02-14)\n-----------------\n\n- Added class on form button.\n  Changed select translation.\n  [sgeulette]\n- The transition reason for which a transition can not be triggered now contains\n  the msg as a `zope.i18nmessageid.message.Message` instance, so translate it.\n  This is done because the appy `No` msg attribute can not be unicode...\n  [gbastien]\n\n1.23 (2017-01-30)\n-----------------\n\n- Fix workflow guard check on group conditions.\n  [sdelcourt]\n\n\n1.22 (2017-01-23)\n-----------------\n\n- Corrected code to work with collective.externaleditor >= 1.0.3.\n  [sgeulette]\n\n1.21 (2016-12-21)\n-----------------\n\n- Implemented method `getGroups` for the APOmnipotentUser\n  that returns an empty list because default implementation\n  will raise an `AttributeError` on `portal_groups`.\n  [gbastien]\n\n1.20 (2016-12-05)\n-----------------\n\n- Added possibility to define a CSS class on the edit action.  To do this,\n  pass the value for `edit_action_class` in the kwargs.  This make it possible\n  to use a class that will enable an overlay for the edit action.\n  [gbastien]\n- Added section that renders arrows to move elements to top/up/down/bottom,\n  this only appears if useIcons is True.\n  [gbastien]\n- While rendering transition button including portal_type title, translate\n  portal_type title in the domain defined on the typeInfo of portal_types,\n  not systematically in the \"plone\" domain.\n  [gbastien]\n- When an element is deleted, check if response received by JS method\n  `deleteElement` is an url or a page content.  In case a Redirect exception\n  is raised, we receive the entire page content and not an url to redirect to.\n  [gbastien]\n- Use permission `ManageProperties` to protect the `renderArrows` section.\n  Make sure `saveHasActions` is called correctly in the\n  `actions_panel_arrows.pt` template.\n  [gbastien]\n- Check if current context is a folderish in `addableContents` used for the\n  `deleteElement` section because `folder_factories` return parent's addable\n  content_types if current context is not folderish, this makes the button\n  appear when you can not add content, and if used, content is actually added\n  to the parent.\n  [gbastien]\n- Translate workflow transition title and no more id\n  [sgeulette]\n\n1.19 (2016-06-22)\n-----------------\n\n- Take external edition into account when rendering the `edit` action.\n  [sdelcourt]\n\n1.18 (2016-06-17)\n-----------------\n\n- Use window.open(url, `_parent`) to manage actions instead of window.location\n  so new location is opened in the `_parent` frame, this way, when opened from\n  an iframe, the location is not opened in the iframe but in the parent/full\n  frame.\n  [gbastien]\n- Fixed CSS style for the notTriggerableTransition CSS class so it is displayed\n  correctly in Chrome.\n  [gbastien]\n\n1.17 (2016-04-15)\n-----------------\n\n- Made a transitions sort method, that can be overrided.\n  [sgeulette]\n\n1.16 (2016-01-21)\n-----------------\n\n- Message when deleting an element (delete_confirm_message) is now more\n  clear to specify that element will be deleted from the system definitively.\n  [gbastien]\n- When a WorkflowException is raised during a WF transition, display the exception\n  message, this way a beforeTransition event may raise this exception and display\n  a particular message to the user.\n  [gbastien]\n\n\n1.15 (2015-12-03)\n-----------------\n\n- Use an onClick instead of the `href` on the actions rendered by the\n  `actions_panel_actions.pt` to be able to use a javascript method for\n  the action URL.\n  [gbastien]\n- Use `async:false` for jQuery.ajax calls so the ajax loader image (spinner)\n  is displayed in IE and Chrome.\n  [gbastien]\n\n\n1.14 (2015-10-06)\n-----------------\n\n- Use `POST` as type of jQuery.ajax used to add a comment to a workflow\n  transition or it fails when the comment is too long.\n  [gbastien]\n\n\n1.13 (2015-09-04)\n-----------------\n\n- CSS for buttons displayed on the transition confirmation popup\n  [gbastien]\n\n\n1.12 (2015-07-14)\n-----------------\n\n- Make trigger transition and own delete aware of faceted navigation.\n  If the action is made in a faceted navigation, only the faceted page\n  is reloaded, not the entire page\n  [gbastien]\n- Hide the Add menu if no addable content\n  [sgeulette]\n\n\n1.11 (2015-04-23)\n-----------------\n\n- Do not generate the image name to use for a transition but\n  use the actbox_icon defined on the transition\n  [gbastien]\n\n\n1.10 (2015-04-01)\n-----------------\n\n- Use translated transition title in transition confirmation popup\n  [gbastien]\n- Simplified @@triggertransition view by not using objectUID anymore, we use the context\n  as the view is called on it, objectUID was legacy and useless\n  [gbastien]\n\n\n1.9 (2015-03-30)\n----------------\n\n- Store transitions to confirm in the registry\n  [sgeulette]\n- Add a small margin-left to the `notTriggerableTransitionImage` class so if several not\n  triggerable transition actions are displayed, it is not stuck together\n  [gbastien]\n- Rely on imio.history to manage history related section\n  [gbastien]\n\n1.8 (2014-11-05)\n----------------\n\n- Removed IObjectWillBeRemovedEvent, either use same event from OFS.interfaces or in case we use\n  AT, we could need to override manage_beforeDelete as it is called before IObjectWillBeRemovedEvent\n  in the OFS object removal machinery.\n- Do only rely on `mayDelete` method instead of checking `Delete objects` and mayDelete method,\n  this way, we may handle case where user does not have the `Delete objects` but we want him\n  to be able to delete an element nevertheless, in this case, the all logic is managed by mayDelete.\n\n\n1.7 (2014-09-04)\n----------------\n\n- Sort transitions by transition title, more easy to use when displaying several transitons.\n- Corrected bug where the link to trigger a transition that did not need to be confirmed,\n  did not contain the view name, only parameters.  This made the user being redirected to the object\n  view and not able to trigger the transition from another place.\n\n\n1.6 (2014-08-21)\n----------------\n\n- Added submethod _findViewablePlace in _computeBackURL where we can manage\n  where to redirect the member when he was on the object he just deleted.\n  This makes it possible to override only the _findViewable method\n  and keep the other part of _computeBackURL that does manage the case when\n  the member was not on the object he just deleted.\n- Custom action_panels views can now be registered with a different name\n  than `actions_panel`.\n\n\n1.5 (2014-08-20)\n----------------\n\n- Adpated _transitionsToConfirm method to be also able to provide custom\n  view name to use as confirmation popup.\n\n\n1.4 (2014-08-19)\n----------------\n\n- Moved complete computation of back url when an object is removed to\n  _computeBackURL, not only the case when we were on the object we just removed.\n- Added CSS class `actionspanel-no-style-table` on the main actions_panel table\n  and defined styles for it to remove any border/margin/padding.\n\n\n1.3 (2014-08-19)\n----------------\n- Added section that render a link to the object's history if useIcons is True\n- Not triggerable transitions are now also displayed using icon if useIcons is True,\n  before, not triggerable transitions were always displayed as button, no mater useIcons\n  was True or False\n- Simplified method that compute addable contents, the default `folder_factories`\n  does all the job\n- Manage the fact that if after a transition has been triggered on an object,\n  this object is not accessible anymore to the current user, it is redirected\n  to a viewable place\n\n1.2 (2014-07-01)\n----------------\n- Do not lookup an object UID in the uid_catalog,\n  this fails when using dexterity, use portal_catalog or\n  check context UID if element is not indexed\n- Do not display a `-` when no actions to display and not using icons\n- Implement `__call__` instead of `render` on the actions panel view\n  so calling the view is simpler\n- Display AddContent actions.\n\n1.1 (2014-04-03)\n----------------\n- Optimized to be `listing-aware` do some caching by storing not changing parameters\n  into the request and so avoid to recompute it each time the view is instanciated\n- Corrected bug when a transition was triggered using the confirmation popup and\n  resulting object was no more accessible, the popup was recomputed and it raised Unauthorized\n\n1.0 (2014-02-12)\n----------------\n- Initial release",
