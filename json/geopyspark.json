    "description": "GeoPySpark\n***********\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/locationtech-labs/geopyspark.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/locationtech-labs/geopyspark\n\n.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/geopyspark/badge/?version=latest\n   :target: https://geopyspark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n\n\nGeoPySpark is a Python bindings library for `GeoTrellis <http://geotrellis.io>`_, a Scala\nlibrary for working with geospatial data in a distributed environment.\nBy using `PySpark <http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html>`_, GeoPySpark is\nable to provide na interface into the GeoTrellis framework.\n\nA Quick Example\n----------------\n\nHere is a quick example of GeoPySpark. In the following code, we take NLCD data\nof the state of Pennsylvania from 2011, and do a masking operation on it with\na Polygon that represents an area of interest. This masked layer is then saved.\n\nIf you wish to follow along with this example, you will need to download the\nNLCD data and unzip it.. Running these two commands will complete these tasks\nfor you:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   curl -o /tmp/NLCD2011_LC_Pennsylvannia.zip https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prd-tnm/StagedProducts/NLCD/2011/landcover/states/NLCD2011_LC_Pennsylvania.zip?ORIG=513_SBDDG\n   unzip -d /tmp /tmp/NLCD2011_LC_Pennsylvannia.zip\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  import geopyspark as gps\n\n  from pyspark import SparkContext\n  from shapely.geometry import box\n\n\n  # Create the SparkContext\n  conf = gps.create_geopyspark_conf(appName=\"geopyspark-example\", master=\"local[*]\")\n  sc = SparkContext(conf=conf)\n\n  # Read in the NLCD tif that has been saved locally.\n  # This tif represents the state of Pennsylvania.\n  raster_layer = gps.geotiff.get(layer_type=gps.LayerType.SPATIAL,\n                                 uri='/tmp/NLCD2011_LC_Pennsylvania.tif',\n                                 num_partitions=100)\n\n  # Tile the rasters within the layer and reproject them to Web Mercator.\n  tiled_layer = raster_layer.tile_to_layout(layout=gps.GlobalLayout(), target_crs=3857)\n\n  # Creates a Polygon that covers roughly the north-west section of Philadelphia.\n  # This is the region that will be masked.\n  area_of_interest = box(-75.229225, 40.003686, -75.107345, 40.084375)\n\n  # Mask the tiles within the layer with the area of interest\n  masked = tiled_layer.mask(geometries=area_of_interest)\n\n  # We will now pyramid the masked TiledRasterLayer so that we can use it in a TMS server later.\n  pyramided_mask = masked.pyramid()\n\n  # Save each layer of the pyramid locally so that it can be accessed at a later time.\n  for pyramid in pyramided_mask.levels.values():\n      gps.write(uri='file:///tmp/pa-nlcd-2011',\n                layer_name='north-west-philly',\n                tiled_raster_layer=pyramid)\n\n\nContact and Support\n--------------------\n\nIf you need help, have questions, or like to talk to the developers (let us\nknow what you're working on!) you contact us at:\n\n * `Gitter <https://gitter.im/geotrellis/geotrellis>`_\n * `Mailing list <https://locationtech.org/mailman/listinfo/geotrellis-user>`_\n\nAs you may have noticed from the above links, those are links to the GeoTrellis\ngitter channel and mailing list. This is because this project is currently an\noffshoot of GeoTrellis, and we will be using their mailing list and gitter\nchannel as a means of contact. However, we will form our own if there is a need\nfor it.\n\nSetup\n------\n\nGeoPySpark Requirements\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n============ ============\nRequirement  Version\n============ ============\nJava         >=1.8\nScala        >=2.11\nPython       3.3 - 3.6\nHadoop       >=2.1.1\n============ ============\n\nJava 8 and Scala 2.11 are needed for GeoPySpark to work; as they are required by\nGeoTrellis. In addition, Spark needs to be installed and configured with the\nenvironment variable, ``SPARK_HOME`` set.\n\nYou can test to see if Spark is installed properly by running the following in\nthe terminal:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   > echo $SPARK_HOME\n   /usr/local/bin/spark\n\nIf the return is a path leading to your Spark folder, then it means that Spark\nhas been configured correctly.\n\nHow to Install\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nBefore installing, check the above table to make sure that the\nrequirements are met.\n\nInstalling From Pip\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo install via ``pip`` open the terminal and run the following:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   pip install geopyspark\n   geopyspark install-jar -p [path/to/install/jar]\n\nWhere the first command installs the python code from PyPi and the second\ndownloads the backend, jar file. If no path is given when downloading the jar,\nthen it will be downloaded to wherever GeoPySpark was installed at.\n\nWhat's With That Weird Pip Install?\n====================================\n\n\"What's with that weird pip install?\", you may be asking yourself. The reason\nfor its unusualness is due to how GeoPySpark functions. Because this library\nis a python binding for a Scala project, we need to be able to access the\nScala backend. To do this, we plug into PySpark which acts as a bridge between\nPython and Scala. However, in order to achieve this the Scala code needs to be\nassembled into a jar file. This poses a problem due to its size (117.7 MB at\nv0.1.0-RC!). To get around the size constraints of PyPi, we thus utilized this\nmethod of distribution where the jar must be downloaded in a separate command\nwhen using ``pip install``.\n\nNote:\n  Installing from source or for development does not require the separate\n  download of the jar.\n\nInstalling From Source\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you would rather install from source, clone the GeoPySpark repo and enter it.\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   git clone https://github.com/locationtech-labs/geopyspark.git\n   cd geopyspark\n\nInstalling For Users\n=====================\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   make install\n\nThis will assemble the backend-end ``jar`` that contains the Scala code,\nmove it to the ``jars`` sub-package, and then runs the ``setup.py`` script.\n\nNote:\n  If you have altered the global behavior of ``sbt`` this install may\n  not work the way it was intended.\n\nInstalling For Developers\n===========================\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   make build\n   pip install -e .\n\n``make build`` will assemble the back-end ``jar`` and move it the ``jars``\nsub-package. The second command will install GeoPySpark in \"editable\" mode.\nMeaning any changes to the source files will also appear in your system\ninstallation.\n\nInstalling to a Virtual Environment\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA third option is to install GeoPySpark in a virtual environment. To get things\nstarted, enter the environment and run the following:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   git clone https://github.com/locationtech-labs/geopyspark.git\n   cd geopyspark\n   export PYTHONPATH=$VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/<your python version>/site-packages\n\nReplace ``<your python version`` with whatever Python version\n``virtualenvwrapper`` is set to. Installation in a virtual environment can be\na bit weird with GeoPySpark. This is why you need to export the\n``PYTHONPATH`` before installing to ensure that it performs correctly.\n\nInstalling For Users\n=====================\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   make virtual-install\n\nInstalling For Developers\n===========================\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   make build\n   pip install -e .\n\n\nDeveloping GeoPySpark With GeoNotebook\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n**Note**: Before begining this section, it should be noted that python-mapnik,\na dependency for GeoNotebook, has been found to be difficult to install. If\nproblems are encountered during installation, a possible work around would be\nto run ``make wheel`` and then do ``docker cp`` the ``wheel`` into the\nGeoPySpark docker container and install it from there.\n\n`GeoNotebook <https://github.com/OpenGeoscience/geonotebook>`_ is a Jupyter\nnotebook extension that specializes in working with geospatial data. GeoPySpark\ncan be used with this notebook; which allows for a more interactive experience\nwhen using the library. For this section, we will be installing both tools in a\nvirtual environment. It is recommended that you start with a new environment\nbefore following this guide.\n\nBecause there's already documentation on how to install GeoPySpark in a virtual\nenvironment, we won't go over it here. As for GeoNotebook, it also has a section\non `installation <https://github.com/OpenGeoscience/geonotebook#make-a-virtualenv-install-jupyternotebook-install-geonotebook>`_\nso that will not be covered here either.\n\nOnce you've setup both GeoPySpark and GeoNotebook, all that needs to be done\nis go to where you want to save/have saved your notebooks and execute this\ncommand:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   jupyter notebook\n\nThis will open up the jupyter hub and will allow you to work on your notebooks.\n\nIt is also possible to develop with both GeoPySpark and GeoNotebook in editable mode.\nTo do so you will need to re-install and re-register GeoNotebook with Jupyter.\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   pip uninstall geonotebook\n   git clone --branch feature/geotrellis https://github.com/geotrellis/geonotebook ~/geonotebook\n   pip install -r ~/geonotebook/prerequirements.txt\n   pip install -r ~/geonotebook/requirements.txt\n   pip install -e ~/geonotebook\n   jupyter serverextension enable --py geonotebook\n   jupyter nbextension enable --py geonotebook\n   make notebook\n\nThe default ``Geonotebook (Python 3)`` kernel will require the following environment variables to be defined:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   export PYSPARK_PYTHON=\"/usr/local/bin/python3\"\n   export SPARK_HOME=\"/usr/local/apache-spark/2.1.1/libexec\"\n   export PYTHONPATH=\"${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/py4j-0.10.4-src.zip:${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/pyspark.zip\"\n\nMake sure to define them to values that are correct for your system.\nThe ``make notebook`` command also makes used of ``PYSPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS`` variable defined in the ``Makefile``.\n\nGeoNotebook/GeoTrellis integration in currently in active development and not part of GeoNotebook master.\nThe latest development is on a ``feature/geotrellis`` branch at ``<https://github.com/geotrellis/geonotebook>``.\n\nSide Note For Developers\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAn optional (but recommended!) step for developers is to place these\ntwo lines of code at the top of your notebooks.\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   %load_ext autoreload\n   %autoreload 2\n\nThis will make it so that you don't have to leave the notebook for your changes\nto take affect. Rather, you just have to reimport the module and it will be\nupdated. However, there are a few caveats when using ``autoreload`` that can be\nread `here <http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/extensions/autoreload.html#caveats>`_.\n\nUsing ``pip install -e`` in conjunction with ``autoreload`` should cover any\nchanges made, though, and will make the development experience much less\npainful.\n\nGeoPySpark Script\n-----------------\n\nWhen GeoPySpark is installed, it comes with a script which can be accessed\nfrom anywhere on you computer. These are the commands that can be ran via the\nscript:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   geopyspark install-jar -p, --path [download/path] //downloads the jar file\n   geopyspark jar-path //returns the relative path of the jar file\n   geopyspark jar-path -a, --absolute //returns the absolute path of the jar file\n\nThe first command is only needed when installing GeoPySpark through ``pip``;\nand it **must** be ran before using GeoPySpark. If no path is selected, then\nthe jar will be installed wherever GeoPySpark was installed.\n\nThe second and third commands are for getting the location of the jar file.\nThese can be used regardless of installation method. However, if installed\nthrough ``pip``, then the jar must be downloaded first or these commands\nwill not work.\n\n\nRunning GeoPySpark Tests\n-------------------------\n\nGeoPySpark uses the `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ testing\nframework to run its unittests. If you wish to run GeoPySpark's unittests,\nthen you must first clone this repository to your machine. Once complete,\ngo to the root of the library and run the following command:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   pytest\n\nThis will then run all of the tests present in the GeoPySpark library.\n\n**Note**: The unittests require additional dependencies in order to pass fully.\n`pyrproj <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyproj?>`_, `colortools <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colortools/0.1.2>`_,\nand `matplotlib <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/matplotlib/2.0.2>`_  (only for >=Python3.4) are needed to\nensure that all of the tests pass.\n\nMake Targets\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n - **install** - install GeoPySpark python package locally\n - **wheel** - build python GeoPySpark wheel for distribution\n - **pyspark** - start pyspark shell with project jars\n - **build** - builds the backend jar and moves it to the jars sub-package\n - **clean** - remove the wheel, the backend jar file, and clean the\n   geotrellis-backend directory\n\nUninstalling\n------------\n\nTo uninstall GeoPySpark, run the following in the terminal:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   pip uninstall geopyspark\n   rm .local/bin/geopyspark\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nAny kind of feedback and contributions to GeoPySpark is always welcomed.\nA CLA is required for contribution, see `Contributing <docs/contributing.rst>`_ for more\ninformation.\n\n\n",
