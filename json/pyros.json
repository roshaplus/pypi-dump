But they make interfacing a `ROS`_ system with existing python packages much more tricky than needed, and often the outcome is not quite the expected one :\n\n- Most web servers spawn multiple processes to handle concurrent requests, and an interpreter is loaded in each process, which also has the WSGI application executed for each request. That means, if you use `rospy`_ directly you end up with as many nodes as there is web processes (at best). Exactly duplicated nodes which you don't need in your `ROS`_ environment. Also these can take time to start, become inconsistent after a while, etc. This is not what a developer working on a robot wants to happen.\n- Custom multiprocess software (like `celery`_) have their own expectation and complex setup regarding global state and how processes are managed by the application, between the import from multiple places, multiple launches, and the way memory is managed. Mixing this with the way `rospy`_ does things is just a recipe for disaster.\n\nPyros solves these problems by : \n\n- dynamically loading `ROS`_ environment on python import (with `pyros-setup`_).\n- not relying on `ROS`_ to implement multiprocess communications.\n- keeping each multiprocess system implementation isolated in their own process.\n\nSupported distributions currently\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n- ROS : Indigo\n\nThis package can also be used from source as a normal ROS package.\nAdd it to your ROS workspace as a usual repository and everything should work.\nIf it doesn't work from source as you would expect it, please submit an issue.\n\nComing up soon\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n- [ ] a pip package is available to be installed from source (works via rosdep).\n- [ ] an ubuntu (virtual env embedded) is provided to install pyros on your Ubuntu Trusty to use pyros from binary.\n\n=> If you want to build a binary package depending on pyros, you should rely on the pip dependency mechanism and embed the appropriate version into your deb (virtual env embedded).\n\nRoadmap\n-------\n\nWe should do what we can to catch up on IoT platforms design.\nAlthough Pyros focus on pure python design, another package depending on it should enable ROS systems to connect as device to these IoT platforms.\n\nCurrently Rostful provide HTTP connection to your robot.\nFor example another project could provide MQTT connection to your robot, following amazon choice of using MQTT (OASIS Standard).\n\nIoT platforms design :\n\n- Amazon :  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/protocols.html\n\nWill NOT do in pyros\n--------------------\n- Support for Actions (http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib) in pyros itself.\n\nActions are built upon multiple ROS topics, and can be interfaced like that,\nby writing an action client on the other hand ( pure python, javascript on top of rostful, etc. ),\nwith pyros just forwarding all the required topics.\n\nIf this statement happens to be not true, this can be reconsidered.\nAdditionally when interfacing with other systems \"outside\" of ROS, services are probably what you want,\nmaybe also topics sometimes, but probably not actions.\nAnd actions can probably be implemented with just only a couple of services.\nThe problem here is likely the latency + communication rate that will, anyway, be hard to maintain while moving through layers to go outside of `ROS`_.\n\n- Support for Rocon (http://wiki.ros.org/rocon) in pyros itself.\n\nAlthough early versions of pyros were supporting rocon features (Rapps, interactions, etc.), the maintenance effort required is too high right now, and anyway it is probably better to have a more solid pyros available to allow people to develop packages on top of pyros to match Rocon features from outside of ROS, if the need arises.\n\n=> We probably will not support anything that is not part of the core of ROS. As long as implementation in another python package is possible using pyros.\n\n.. _ROS : http://wiki.ros.org/\n.. _ROS node : http://wiki.ros.org/Nodes\n.. _pyros-setup : https://github.com/asmodehn/pyros-setup\n.. _rostful : https://github.com/asmodehn/rostful\n.. _rospy : https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/tree/indigo-devel/clients/rospy\n.. _celery : https://github.com/celery/celery\n.. _flask : https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask\n",
