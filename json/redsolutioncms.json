    "description": "======================\nRedsolution CMS README\n======================\n\nDevelopment Lyrics:\n===================\n\nWe've been developing Django sites 4 years. We made many sites and came to the \nconclusion:\n\n- Standard function should be performed with standard libraries.\n- Those libraries should be maintained separately from the production site.\n- Libraries should be easily supported\n\nAfter all, we decided to create a product which would help us to bulid site with \nlatest stable versions of standard modules. `zc.buildout`_ was appropriate tool,\nbut most of modules needs to be configured, configurations differs from one \nmodule version to another. Buildout can't handle configuration options like \n`django.conf.settings` or urls. \nAlso we want to escape from design process and bugfixes. Webdesign should be\ncreated with web designers.\nWe decided that our product should be able to make a website template, ready for\nfurther development and customizing.\n\n.. _`zc.buildout`: 'http://www.buildout.org/'\n\nFeatures:\n=========\n\n- Web wizard site creation\n- Portable crossplatform code\n- Work with Python Package Index\n\nInstallation:\n=============\n\nFrom setup package\n------------------\n\nDownload package for your system from `our site`_  and install it.\n\nCreate new folder, in which you you want to install site. In console, from that folder\nrun ::\n\n    redsolutioncms  \n\nThats's all. CMS will download Django and some nessesary libraries and open web \nbrowser window (or tab) with first step of wizard. At the end of wizard you will\nget website installed in specified folder, also installable on production server.\n\n.. _`our site`: 'http://www.redsolutioncms.org/downloads'\n\nFrom source\n-----------\n\nDownload source distribution, or clone repository from `github`_. Just like when\nyou install from package, create a folder. Extend your system environment variable\n``PYTHONPATH``: ::\n\n    $ export PYTHONPATH=<path-to-redsoultioncms-folder>\n\n(on windows use ``set PYTHONPATH=<path-to-redsoultioncms-folder>``)\n\nand run loader: ::\n\n    $ <path-to-redsoultioncms-folder>/redsolutioncms/loader.py\n\nThen you will et the same results.\n\n.. _`github`: 'http://github.com/redsolution/redsolution-cms'\n\n\nFor more documentation, visit: http://www.redsolutioncms.org",
