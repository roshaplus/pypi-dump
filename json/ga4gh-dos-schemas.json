This\ncollaborative consortium takes place primarily via github and public\nmeetings. Join the issues today to help us make a cloud agnostic Data\nObject Service!\n\nCloud Workstream\n----------------\n\nThe `Data Working Group <http://ga4gh.org/#/>`__ concentrates on data\nrepresentation, storage, and analysis, including working with platform\ndevelopment partners and industry leaders to develop standards that will\nfacilitate interoperability. The Cloud Workstream is an informal,\nmulti-vendor working group focused on standards for exchanging\nDocker-based tools and CWL/WDL workflows, execution of Docker-based\ntools and workflows on clouds, and abstract access to cloud object\nstores.\n\nWhat is DOS?\n------------\n\nCurrently, this is the home of the Data Object Service (DOS) API\nproposal. This repo has a CWL-based build process ready to go and a\nplace for us to collectively work on `USECASES.md <USECASES.md>`__.\n\nThis proposal for a DOS release is based on the schema work of Brian W.\nand others from OHSU along with work by UCSC. It also is informed by\nexisting object storage systems such as:\n\n-  GNOS: http://annaisystems.com/ (as used by PCAWG, see\n   https://pcawg.icgc.org)\n-  ICGC Storage: as used to store data on S3, see\n   https://github.com/icgc-dcc/dcc-storage and\n   https://dcc.icgc.org/icgc-in-the-cloud/aws\n-  HCA Storage: see https://dss.staging.data.humancellatlas.org/ and\n   https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/data-store\n-  the GDC Storage: see https://gdc.cancer.gov\n-  Keep by Curoverse: see https://arvados.org/ and\n   https://github.com/curoverse/arvados\n\nThe goal of DOS is to create a generic API on top of these and other\nprojects, so workflow systems can access data in the same way regardless\nof project. One section of the API focuses on how to read and write data\nobjects to cloud environments and how to join them together as data\nbundles (Data object management). Another focuses on the ability to find\ndata objects across cloud environments and implementations of DOS (Data\nobject queries). The latter is likely to be worked on in conjunction\nwith the GA4GH Discovery Workstream.\n\nKey features of the current API proposal:\n\nData object management\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThis section of the API focuses on how to read and write data objects to\ncloud environments and how to join them together as data bundles. Data\nbundles are simply a flat collection of one or more files. This section\nof the API enables:\n\n-  create/update/delete a file\n-  create/update/delete a data bundle\n-  register UUIDs with these entities (an optionally track versions of\n   each)\n-  generate signed URLs and/or cloud specific object storage paths and\n   temporary credentials\n\nData object queries\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nA key feature of this API beyond creating/modifying/deletion files is\nthe ability to find data objects across cloud environments and\nimplementations of DOS. This section of the API allows users to query by\ndata bundle or file UUIDs which returns information about where these\ndata objects are available. This response will typically be used to find\nthe same file or data bundle located across multiple cloud environments.\n\nImplementations\n---------------\n\nThere are currently a few experimental implementations that use some\nversion of these schemas.\n\n-  `DOS Connect <https://github.com/ohsu-comp-bio/dos_connect>`__\n   observes cloud and local storage systems and broadcasts their changes\n   to a service that presents DOS endpoints.\n-  `DOS Downloader <https://github.com/david4096/dos-downloader>`__ is a\n   mechanism for downloading Data Objects from DOS URLs.\n-  `dos-gdc-lambda <https://github.com/david4096/dos-gdc-lambda>`__\n   presents data from the GDC public rest API using the Data Object\n   Service.\n-  `dos-signpost-lambda <https://github.com/david4096/dos-signpost-lambda>`__\n   presents data from a signpost instance using the Data Object Service.\n\nBuilding the client and server\n------------------------------\n\nYou can use ``pip`` to install a python client and server that\nimplements these schemas.\n\n::\n\n    virtualenv env\n    source env/bin/activate\n    pip install git+git://github.com/ga4gh/data-object-schemas@master --process-dependency-links\n\nThis will add the python modules ``ga4gh.dos.server`` and\n``ga4gh.dos.client`` you can use in your projects.\n\nThere is also a CLI hook.\n\n::\n\n    ga4gh_dos_server\n    # In another terminal\n    ga4gh_dos_demo\n\nBuilding Documents\n------------------\n\nMake sure you have Docker installed for your platform and the\n``cwltool``.\n\n::\n\n    virtualenv env\n    source env/bin/activate\n    pip install -r python/dev-requirements.txt\n\nYou can generate the `Swagger <http://swagger.io/>`__ YAML from the\nProtocol Buffers:\n\n::\n\n    cwltool CWLFile\n\nFind the output in ``data_objects_service.swagger.json`` and this can be\nloaded in the `Swagger editor <http://swagger.io/swagger-editor/>`__.\nUse the GitHub raw feature to generate a URL you can load.\n\nWhen you're happy with the changes, checkin this file:\n\n::\n\n    mv data_objects_service.swagger.json swagger/proto/\n\nAnd commit your changes, pushing to the appropriate branch.\n\nHow to contribute changes\n-------------------------\n\nTake cues for now from the\n`ga4gh/schemas <https://github.com/ga4gh/schemas/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`__\ndocument.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nSee the `LICENSE <#license>`__\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\n-  `Global Alliance for Genomics and\n   Health <http://genomicsandhealth.org>`__\n-  `Google\n   Forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ga4gh-dwg-containers-workflows>`__\n\n\n",
