    "description": "QUASAR\n======\n\n`QUASAR <http://www.quantego.com/>`_ is a flexible, high-performance modeling system for expressing and\nsolving continuous state, finite-horizon stochastic-dynamic optimization problems in discrete time, where\nconventional methods fail.\n\nThe QUASAR solver library provides\n\n- an algebraic expression system for modeling stochastic-dynamic decision problems with only few lines of code.\n- a solution engine that combines scenario generation, model decomposition, and mathematical optimization.\n- tools and data structures to store, analyze, and visualize simulation output.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nDownload and install the latest stable version of from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org>`_::\n\n    pip install quasar\n\nThe Python package includes a trial version of QUASAR out-of-the-box. For an academic trial,\nor a productive license for commercial use, visit `quantego.com <http://www.quantego.com>`_.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nPython 2.7 or 3.4 and Java JRE/JDK 1.7 or later.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nQUASAR is designed for usage with `Jupyter <http://jupyter.org/>`_. For sample notebooks, check out our\n`tutorial repository <https://github.com/quantego/python-tutorial>`_.\n\n\nLicensing\n---------\nCommercial Quantego License. See the LICENSE file for details.",
