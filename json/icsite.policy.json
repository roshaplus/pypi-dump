    "description": "*************\nicsite.policy\n*************\n\nThis is the policy product for the Informatics Center website.  It turns a\nplain old vanilla Plone_ site into the site for the Early Detection Research\nNetwork's Informatics Center website, nominally hosted at\nhttp://cancer.jpl.nasa.gov/.\n\nThe EDRN_ Informatics Center develops bio-informatics software to support\nearly detection and eventual eradication of cancer.  It's a project of the Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory (JPL_).\n\n.. References:\n.. _Plone: http://plone.org/\n.. _EDRN: http://edrn.nci.nih.gov/\n.. _JPL: http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/\n\n\nicsite.policy Installation\n==========================\n\nUse zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance:\n\n* Add ``icsite.policy`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::\n\n    [buildout]\n    ...\n    eggs =\n        ...\n        icsite.policy\n        \n* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::\n  \n    [instance]\n    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance\n    ...\n    zcml =\n        icsite.policy\n        \n* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::\n  \n    $ ./bin/buildout\n        \nYou can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package\nfrom another package's configure.zcml file.\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n2.0.1 \u2014 Blogging\n----------------\n\nThis release adds a blogging add-on.\n\n\n2.0.0 \u2014 Plone 4\n---------------\n\nThis release makes icsite.policy compatible with Plone 4.\n\n\n1.0.2 \u2014 Survey Time\n-------------------\n\nAdded PloneFormGen as a dependency.  This enables quick 'n easy creation of\nforms through the web, and addresses our need to come up with a voting system\nfor the new name of ERNE.\n\n\n0.0.0 \u2014 Unreleased\n------------------\n\n* Initial release\n\n\n\nCopyright\n=========\n\nCopyright 2008\u20132011 by the California Institute of Technology.
