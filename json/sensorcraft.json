Most people are familiar with Minecraft (Minecraft is \ndeveloped by Mojang and not related to this project nor do they endorse this \nproject), for this project we are using a \u201cworld of blocks\u201d environment created \nin the Python programming language that will allow children to explore \nsimulations in order to conduct their own scientific experiments. Kids can \nchange gravity, learn how to build structures programmatically, and even \nlaunch a rocket.  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Sensors Directorate \nlocated in Dayton, Ohio created this project to inspire kids of all ages to \nlearn to program and at the same time get an idea of what it is like to be a \nScientist or Engineer for the United States Air Force.\n\nTo get started download the         `latest release zip file\n<https://github.com/rovitotv/SensorCraft/releases/latest>`_  and unzip, then\nopen the file \"index.html\" file in your browser.\n\nA `YouTube video has been created <https://youtu.be/C9n1bS54AIw>`_\nto show students how to install SensorCraft and Enthought Canopy\nthen run the examples.  The video is for Mac OS X but the process\nfor Windows and Linux is similar.  **SensorCraft requires Python 2.7, make sure\nyou install a version of Enthought Canopy that supports Python 2.7.**\n\n  \nGitHub Release\n==============\n\n`v1.8 Thanks to @Fladam Dr. Steve can now ride the rocket, updated Enthought install directions to reflect new version, and added a FAQ <https://github.com/rovitotv/SensorCraft/releases/download/v1.8/SensorCraftV1.8.zip>`_\n\n`v1.7.1 Changed gravity and jump height back to default <https://github.com/rovitotv/SensorCraft/releases/download/v1.7.1/SensorCraftV1.7.1.zip>`_\n\n`v1.7 Crushed bugs and added a new chapter on creating the NMUSAF <https://github.com/rovitotv/SensorCraft/releases/download/v1.7/SensorCraftV1.7.zip>`_\n\n`v1.6 Much improved install and run directions <https://github.com/rovitotv/SensorCraft/releases/download/v1.6/SensorCraftV1.6.zip>`_\n\n`v1.5  Directory consolidation <https://github.com/rovitotv/SensorCraft/releases/download/v1.5/SensorCraftV1.5.zip>`_\n\n`v1.4 Rocket Launch <https://github.com/rovitotv/SensorCraft/releases/download/v1.4/SensorCraftV1.4.zip>`_\n\n`v1.3 Mores Updates to README <https://github.com/rovitotv/SensorCraft/releases/download/v1.3/SensorCraftV1.3.zip>`_\n\n`v1.2 Update to README <https://github.com/rovitotv/SensorCraft/releases/download/v1.2/SensorCraftV1.2.zip>`_\n\n`v1.1 First CD release <https://github.com/rovitotv/SensorCraft/releases/download/v1.1/SensorCraftV1.1.zip>`_\n\nThe latest version will always be on the `github project site \n<https://github.com/rovitotv/SensorCraft>`_.\n\nCD Release\n==========\n\nFor STEM events we have created a CD from this content, to begin with the CD open index.html\n\nLast commit before March 3rd, 2016 demonstration for My Brother's Keeper STEM \nEvent\n\nOverview of the products in this directory for the CD release:\n\n* HTML web version that can be open in web browser is in _build/html/index.html\n* PDFs of the web pages are in PDFs/\n* code includes python code for the different exercises\n* images the images that appear in the PDFs and HTML\n* OriginalFoglemanCode the code started \n* SensorCraftLogo is a directory with the CD cover and RYA generated art work\n* EnthoughtCanopy directory contains Windows and Mac versions of Enthought Canopy Express, please check the Enthought web site for the latest version\n\nThe CD doesn't have the rocket launch chapter so consider updating from the\nlatest github release.\n\n\n\nLogos and Third Party Materials\n===============================\n\nPython\n------\n\nPython is an open source programming language and it's logo is meant to be\nused on Python derived products see https://www.python.org/community/logos/\n\nWe believe this product conforms to the Python Software Foundation's \npolicy. \n\nMinecraft by Mojang\n-------------------\n\nMojang the creators of Minecraft are liberal with their IP:\nhttps://account.mojang.com/documents/brand_guidelines\n\nWe believe this product conforms to Mojang's guidelines.\n\nEnthought Canopy Express\n------------------------\n\nIncluded on the CD is Enthought Canopy Express which is a Python distribution\nthat includes Python plus pyglet that performs the OpenGL work.  In addition\nEnthought Canopy Express includes an excellent editor that will make it easier\nto work with the code.  Enthought offers an academic product that is free for\nstudents and teachers, more `details are provided at Enthought's web site\n<https://store.enthought.com/#canopy-academic>`_\n\nQuestion 10 of `Enthought's Canopy FAQ\n<https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/faq/>`_ grants us permission to\nredistribute Enthought Canopy Express and can include it on CDs or DVDs.\n\nMiscellaneous\n=============\n\nThis project is done with restructured text which is Python's default for\ndocumentation it creates html pages.  \n\nReferences to Sphinx documentation:\nhttps://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html\n\nSteps to build and make release\n-------------------------------\n\nAssume the version we are going to release is 1.5 and will reside in\n~/temp/SensorCraftV1.5. The makefile within the project will build the html\nfiles with this command::\n\n\tcd /Volumes/SecureCode/SensorCraft/guide\n\tmake clean && make html\n\tmkdir ~/temp/SensorCraftV1.5\n\tcd _build/html\n\tcp -av * ~/temp/SensorCraftV1.5\n\tcp ~/temp/SensorCraftV1.5/index.html ~/temp/SensorCraftV1.5/START_HERE.html\n\tcd ../../..\n\tcp -av code ~/temp/SensorCraftV1.5/\n\tcd ~/temp\n\tzip -r SensorCraftV1.5.zip SensorCraftV1.5\n\tcd /Volumes/SecureCode/SensorCraft\n\nMakes changes to the README.rst to reflect a new release, then perform the\nfollowing commands::\n\n\tgit commit -a\n\tgit tag -a v1.5 -m \"version 1.5 - Directory consolidation\"\n\tgit push\n\tgit push --tags\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\npyglet for OpenGL support and sphinx to build the documentation\n\nHow to get release download count from GitHub\n---------------------------------------------\n\nGitHub has a RESTFul API so use the CURL commands::\n\t\n\tcurl -i https://api.github.com/repos/rovitotv/SensorCraft/releases &> ~/temp/GHSensorCraftRelease.txt\n\tcat ~/temp/GHSensorCraftRelease.txt | grep 'download_count'",
