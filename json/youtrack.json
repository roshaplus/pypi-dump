    "description": "|official JetBrains project|\n\nYouTrack REST API Client Library for Python\n===========================================\n\nThis is a Python client library that you can use to access the REST API\nfor JetBrains YouTrack. Previously, this repository also included\ncommand-line tools for importing issues from other issue trackers. We\nhave created a `separate\nrepository <https://github.com/JetBrains/youtrack-python-scripts>`__ to\nstore scripts that use this library.\n\nThe primary purpose of this library is to support migration to YouTrack,\nbut you are welcome to build integrations with it as well. If you choose\nto work with this library, please be mindful of the following\nlimitations: - We don't provide any documentation for this library. You\ncan either learn through trial and error or by dissecting the import\nscripts in the linked repository. - This library references an older\nversion of the YouTrack REST API. Many of the newer features in YouTrack\nare not supported.\n\nWe will continue to support this library with updates that are required\nto support issue import. Other issues that are not import related may be\nclosed. Our intention is to eventually publish a fully-documented\nlibrary that uses the latest version of the YouTrack REST API and is\nalso compatible with Python 3.\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\n\nThis client library and the import scripts that use the library are\ncompatible with Python 2.7+. Python 3 releases are not supported.\n\nThis library supports YouTrack Standalone versions 5.x and higher as\nwell as the current version of YouTrack InCloud. The REST API is enabled\nby default in all YouTrack installations.\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nThis package has been published to PyPI and can be installed with pip.\n``pip install youtrack``\n\nAuthentication\n--------------\n\nTo communicate with YouTrack, you need a connection. - The preferred\nmethod is to use a permanent token for authentication requests. You can\ngenerate your own permanent tokens in your user profile. For\ninstructions, refer to the `YouTrack\ndocumentation <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/youtrack/standalone/Manage-Permanent-Token.html#obtain-permanent-token>`__.\n- You can also authenticate using a login and password, however, these\nvalues are printed in plain text and expose your credentials in your\nclient application.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from youtrack.connection import Connection as YouTrack\n\n    // authentication request with permanent token\n    yt = YouTrack('https://instance_name.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/', token='perm:abcdefghijklmn')\n\n    // versus authentication with username and password\n    yt = YouTrack('https://instance_name.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/', login='username', password='password')\n\nThis request requires that you specify the base URL of the target\nYouTrack server. For YouTrack InCloud instances, your base URL includes\nthe trailing ``/youtrack``, as shown in the previous example.\n\nOnce you have established a connection, your credentials are cached for\nsubsequent requests.\n\nSupported Operations\n--------------------\n\nMost of the operations that are supported by the YouTrack REST API are\nmapped to methods for the ``Connection`` object. The Python client\nlibrary, however, supports a simplified set of parameters. In some\ncases, like ``createIssue``, the Python method supports a custom set of\nrequest parameters.\n\nTo learn more about the YouTrack REST API, refer to the `YouTrack\ndocumentation <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/youtrack/standalone/YouTrack-REST-API-Reference.html>`__.\n\nYouTrack Support\n----------------\n\nYour feedback is always appreciated. - To report bugs and request\nupdates, please `create an\nissue <http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/JT#newissue=yes>`__. - If\nyou experience problems with an import script, please `submit a support\nrequest <https://youtrack-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us>`__.\n\n.. |official JetBrains project| image:: http://jb.gg/badges/official-flat-square.svg\n   :target: https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub",
