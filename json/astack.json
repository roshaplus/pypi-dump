    "description": "## astack\n\nYou've heard of jstack and pstack, well this is a new tool\ncalled astack.\n\nastack is a swiss army knife of easily getting thread dumps\nfrom JVMs and analyzing them from the command line.\n\nGuiding principles:\n\n- No complicated network setup (e.g. JMX)\n- Designed for linux (sorry OS X)\n- Single file script for ease of copying\n\nDependencies:\n\n- gdb\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![Using the aggregation option](https://github.com/HubSpot/astack/raw/master/images/screenshot-aggregate.png)\n\n![Using the grep option](https://github.com/HubSpot/astack/raw/master/images/screenshot-grep.png)\n\n### Synopsis\n\nThere are two steps to invoking `astack`: (1) select which process to inspect and\n(2) specify what action to take. There are two ways to select which process:\n\n1) `-p PID` - Select based on PID\n1) `-n NAME` - Match based on case insensitive search of command line\n\nNote that name searching does not work if more than one process match.\n\nOnce you have a process, there are a few options you can take to get different\noutput:\n\n1) `-r` - Just get the raw stacktrace as if you sent a SIGQUIT to the java process and captured the stdout with some extra info.\n1) `-a NLINES` - Group and count the threads by `NLINES` of stack and display them in order of occurrence with one representative thread.\n1) `-s NSAMPLES` - Sample the threaddump a few times and display which ones are most active (most oftenly in RUNNABLE state).\n\nUsage description from the process itself:\n\n    Usage: astack [options]\n\n    Options:\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n      -p PID, --pid=PID     process pid\n      -n NAME, --process-name=NAME\n                            match name of process\n      -r, --raw             print the raw stacktrace and exit\n      -u, --upgrade         automatically upgrade\n      -a AGG, --aggregate=AGG\n                            Aggregate stacktraces (specify the number of lines to\n                            aggregate)\n      -s SAMPLE, --sample=SAMPLE\n                            Sample stacktraces to the most active ones (specify\n                            the number of seconds)\n      -i INPUT, --input=INPUT\n                            read stacktrace from file (or - with stdin)\n      --pretty, --pretty    Force colors\n      -g MATCH, --grep=MATCH\n                            Show only threads that match text\n\n### Theory of Operation\n\nRather than hooking into the JVM and asking it for a stack trace via instrumentation,\nthis script takes the approach of sending a `SIGQUIT` signal and extracting the stacktrace\nfrom the JVM while it's running. The way it does this is by using `gdb` to temporarily\nredirect stdout while the JVM is spouting out the thread dump, and switching it back when\nit's done. This does mean that it can occasionally get some artifacts if your JVM is\nrapidly sending output to stdout. In most typical scenarios (e.g. log lines) you wouldn't\nsee any interference.\n\nThe advantage of using this technique is that even when a JVM is under heavy load and cannot\nfulfill a instrumentaiton approach, the low level response to a `SIGQUIT` signal is still\nfunctional. In most cases, thread dumps are most useful when the JVM is at its limit, so\nthis technique can get interesting results very easily.\n\n### Install\n\n    $ sudo pip install astack\n\n### Ubuntu 10.04 and up support\n\nOn Ubuntu 10.04 and up you'll need to run this (as root):\n\n    # echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope\n\n### Bugs & Issues\n\nFeel free to file any issues with github's [issues](https://github.com/HubSpot/astack/issues/) page.\n\n### License\n\nMIT License, copyright HubSpot 2012.
