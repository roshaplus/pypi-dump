    "description": "A Pure-Python library built as a PDF toolkit.  It is capable of:\n\n- extracting document information (title, author, ...),\n- splitting documents page by page,\n- merging documents page by page,\n- cropping pages,\n- merging multiple pages into a single page,\n- encrypting and decrypting PDF files.\n\nBy being Pure-Python, it should run on any Python platform without any\ndependencies on external libraries.  It can also work entirely on StringIO\nobjects rather than file streams, allowing for PDF manipulation in memory.\nIt is therefore a useful tool for websites that manage or manipulate PDFs.",
