The Factur-X standard is the new e-invoicing standard for France and Germany released in Beta version in July 2017. In Germany, it is also known as the `ZUGFeRD 2.0 <http://www.ferd-net.de/aktuelles/meldungen/verabschiedung-zugferd-2.0_profil-en16931.html/>`_ standard. This standard is based on `CII <http://tfig.unece.org/contents/cross-industry-invoice-cii.htm>`_ (Cross-Industry Invoice) for electronic invoicing. The great idea of the ZUGFeRD/Factur-X standard is to embed an XML file inside the PDF invoice to carry structured information about the invoice. So, with a ZUGFeRD/Factur-X PDF invoice:\n\n* no need to change your habbits and those of your customers: you can still send your PDF invoices by email as usual.\n* customers equiped with a modern accouting software will be able to import the invoice automatically as supplier invoice by taking advantage of the embedded XML file,\n* customers with an ancient accounting software will just open the PDF file with their PDF reader and manually encode the document as supplier invoice in their accounting software.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nThis module requires the Python library *factur-x* developped by Akretion, which depends on PyPDF2. To install it, run:\n\n.. code::\n\n  sudo pip install factur-x\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nYou just need to do the configuration of the module *base_zugferd* (see the description of that module for more information).\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nOn the form view of a customer invoice/refund, just click on the *Print* button as usual to get the Factur-X-compliant PDF file.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/226/10.0\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* for Odoo v11, use the new hooks in the report code to embed the XML file inside the PDF file just after its generation and before it is saved as attachment.\n\n* develop glue modules (or use hasattr() ?) to add to the XML file pieces of information that is carried out by fields defined in other modules such as sale or stock (customer order reference, incoterms, delivery address, etc...).\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/edi/issues>`_. In case of trouble, please\ncheck there if your issue has already been reported. If you spotted it first,\nhelp us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed feedback.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n* Alexis de Lattre <alexis.delattre@akretion.com>\n\nMaintainer\n----------\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nTo contribute to this module, please visit https://odoo-community.org.\n\n\n",
