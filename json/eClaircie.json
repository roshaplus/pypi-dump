    "description": "\u00e9Claircie\n%%%%%%%%%\n\n**\u00e9Claircie -- Blog without clouds!**\n\n\u00e9Claircie is a **100% static** blog engine. It is based on the `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_\ndocumentation generator.\nThe main features are:\n\n+ Restructured Text (ReST) syntax\n\n+ multilingual support, including failback language (ex a website with translated articles in French and the other in English)\n\n+ comments by mail \n\n+ integrated search engine (from Sphinx)\n\n+ multiple themes support (per-category)\n\n+ full multimedia integration:\n\n  + image gallery with miniatures\n\n  + audio player (HTML5)\n\n  + Youtube video (with anti-tracing protection)\n\n+ RSS feed\n\n+ content generation from Python scripts\n\n+ email obfuscation\n\n+ free software (GNU GPL v3 licence)\n\n+ 100% static, **cloud-less computing**! With \u00e9Claircie, no need to use\n  external services for managing comments (ex Disqus) or search (ex Google search bar).\n  This is better because these external services proving \"widgets\" raise some concerns related to\n  **privacy**. In fact, these widgets are often used for tracing users by the enterprises that\n  propose them.\n\nIn French, \"\u00e9claircie\" means \"when the weather improves\".\n\n**Compared to other static blog engines,** like `P\u00e9lican <http://blog.getpelican.com>`_,\n\u00e9Claircie is based on Sphinx. This allows to reuse the Sphinx search engine,\nand also avoid to have to use two slightly different ReST engine (if you already use Sphinx for wrinting\ndocumentation).\n\n**Compared to other Sphinx-based blog engine,** like `Tinkerer <http://tinkerer.me>`_,\n\u00e9Claircie acts both as a preprocessor and an extension for Sphinx.\nThis particular architecture is mandatory for multilingual support.\nIn addition, \u00e9Claircie only rebuild the modified pages of the blog, while Tinkerer always\nrebuild everything from zero, which can take long for big blogs.\n\nIf independence, control of your personal data and respect for privacy are importants to you,\nthen \u00e9Claicie is for you!\n\nFor using \u00e9Claircie, you need:\n\n+ `Python <http://python.org>`_ (3.4)\n\n+ `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_ (tested with version 1.2.2)\n\n+ `Pillows <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/>`_",
