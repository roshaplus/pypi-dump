    "description": "Plover Dict Commands\n====================\n\n*Plugin for enabling, disabling, and changing the priority of dictionaries in Plover.*\n\n**PRIORITY_DICT**\n\n``{PLOVER:PRIORITY_DICT:dict1.json,dict2.json,...}``\n\nMoves selected dictionaries to the top of the dictionary stack.\n\n\n**TOGGLE_DICT**\n\n``{PLOVER:TOGGLE_DICT:+dict1.json,-dict2.json,!dict3.json}``\n\nTurns dictionaries on or off entirely. Each dictionary is prepended with a control symbol:\n\n    \\+    enables a dictionary\n\n    \\-    disables a dictionary\n\n    !    toggles a dictionary\n\n\n**SOLO_DICT and END_SOLO_DICT**\n\n``{PLOVER:SOLO_DICT:+dict1.json...}``\n\n``{PLOVER:END_SOLO_DICT}``\n\nFor temporarily toggling a new list of dictionaries without affecting the old\ndictionary stack. Uses the same control symbols as TOGGLE_DICT,\nthough if the mode itself does not need to toggle its own dictionaries,\nusing only the + to enable dictionaries should be sufficient because\nthe SOLO_DICT command starts with a clean slate of disabled dictionaries.\n\n``END_SOLO_DICT`` restores the dictionary stack to its original state before\na ``SOLO_DICT`` command. Together these two commands are convenient for entering and exiting temporary modes without unexpected interference\nfrom multistroke entries in lower priority dictionaries.\n\nSOLO_DICT backs up your old dictionary stack to a file in your plover configuration directory.\nIf you quit Plover while a SOLO_DICT mode is enabled, using an END_SOLO_DICT stroke will set\nit back to normal.\n\n**Safe temporary modes for programs such as vim**\n\nTo keep vim normal mode predictable and not trigger unexpected strings of\ncommands if Plover sends vim a whole word worth of keystrokes, potential\ninterference from other dictionaries must be prevented and the display of\nuntranslated strokes must be suppressed.\n\nSuppressing untranslated strokes can be done with a very simple python\ndictionary at the lowest priority of the dictionary stack that translates\nanything that reaches it into \"{null}\".\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    #suppress_untranslates.py\n\n    LONGESTKEY = 1\n    def stroke(key):\n        return \"{null}\"\n\nLoading python dictionaries requires installing the follow plugin:\n\nhttps://github.com/benoit-pierre/plover_python_dictionary\n\nSample dictionary entry for exiting vim's insert mode and enabling the command dictionary:\n\n``\"SREFBG\":\"{^}{#Escape}{PLOVER:SOLO_DICT:+vim_navigation.json,+suppress_untranslates.py}``\n\nTo get back out of the mode and put vim back in insert mode, vim_navigation.json needs\none of these definitions:\n\n``\"STPHERT\":\"{PLOVER:END_SOLO_DICT}{^}{#i}\"``\n\n**Language toggling**\n\nWhich way to switch between languages is easiest depends on how many dictionaries you use at\nonce and how often you plan to change your default dictionary setup.\n\nFor a short and rarely changing list of dictionaries, a toggle stroke that deals with all\nthe dictionaries of both languages is easily done.\n\n``\"THROLG\":\"{PLOVER:TOGGLE_DICT:!spanish/main.json,!spanish/user.json,!english/main.json,!english/user.json}\"``\n\nIn this case, dictionaries that are not language specific, like for navigation and commands,\ncan be left alone.\n\nIf you have a long or frequently changing list of dictionaries, a command like the previous one would\nhave to be updated often to avoid unpredictable behavior. If a new dictionary of a language you're not\nusing is active, even at a lower priority, you will likely have single stroke words in one language\nturn into multistroke words in the other language from time to time. It may be easier in this case\nto trigger a secondary set of language dictionaries as a temporary mode as in the vim example\nbecause it will continue to work if you add or remove dictionaries in the primary language.\n\nBecause SOLO_DICT starts with a clean slate, be sure to include any navigation/command dictionaries\nyou want to use while writing in the other language in the list of enabled dictionaries passed to\nSOLO_DICT.\n\n``\"SPAELG\":\"{PLOVER:SOLO_DICT:+spanish/main.json,+spanish/user.json,+commands.json}\"``\n\nAnd in one of the activated dictionaries, have an END_SOLO_DICT definition to restore your previous\nset of dictionaries.\n\n``\"SPWHRAPBG\":\"{PLOVER:END_SOLO_DICT}\"``",
