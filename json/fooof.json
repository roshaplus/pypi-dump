    "description": "\n========================================\nFOOOF: Fitting Oscillations & One-Over F\n========================================\n\nFOOOF is a fast, efficient, physiologically-informed model to parameterize\nneural power spectra, characterizing both the 1/f background, and overlying\npeaks (putative oscillations).\n\nThe model conceives of the neural power spectrum as consisting of two distinct functional processes:\n- A 1/f background, modeled with an exponential fit, with:\n- Band-limited peaks rising above this background (modeled as Gaussians).\n\nWith regards to examing peaks in the frequency domain, as putative oscillations, the benefit\nof the FOOOF approach is that these peaks are characterized in terms of their specific center\nfrequency, amplitude and bandwidth without requiring predefining specific bands of interest.\nIn particular, it separates these peaks from a dynamic, and independently interesting 1/f\nbackground. This conception of the 1/f as potentially functional (and therefore worth carefully\nmodeling) is based on work from the Voytek lab and others that collectively shows that 1/f changes\nacross task demands and participant demographics, and that it may index underlying\nexcitation/inhibition (EI) balance.\n",
