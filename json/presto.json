    "description": "pRESTO - The REpertoire Sequencing TOolkit\n================================================================================\n\npRESTO is a toolkit for processing raw reads from high-throughput sequencing of\nB cell and T cell repertoires.\n\nDramatic improvements in high-throughput sequencing technologies now enable\nlarge-scale characterization of lymphocyte repertoires, defined as the\ncollection of trans-membrane antigen-receptor proteins located on the surface of\nB cells and T cells. The REpertoire Sequencing TOolkit (pRESTO) is composed of a\nsuite of utilities to handle all stages of sequence processing prior to germline\nsegment assignment. pRESTO is designed to handle either single reads or\npaired-end reads. It includes features for quality control, primer masking,\nannotation of reads with sequence embedded barcodes, generation of\nunique molecular identifier (UMI) consensus sequences, assembly of paired-end \nreads and identification of duplicate sequences. Numerous options for sequence \nsorting, sampling and conversion operations are also included.\n\n\nInstallation\n================================================================================\n\nThe simplest way to install the latest stable release of pRESTO is via pip::\n\n    > pip3 install presto --user\n\nThe current development build can be installed using pip and mercurial in\nsimilar fashion::\n\n    > pip3 install hg+https://bitbucket.org/kleinstein/presto#default --user\n\nIf you currently have a development version installed, then you will likely\nneed to add the arguments ``--upgrade --no-deps --force-reinstall`` to the\npip3 command.\n\nRequirements\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n+  `Python 3.4.0 <http://python.org>`__\n+  `setuptools 2.0 <http://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools>`__\n+  `NumPy 1.8 <http://numpy.org>`__\n+  `SciPy 0.14 <http://scipy.org>`__\n+  `pandas 0.15 <http://pandas.pydata.org>`__\n+  `Biopython 1.65 <http://biopython.org>`__\n+  AlignSets requires `MUSCLE v3.8 <http://www.drive5.com/muscle>`__\n+  ClusterSets requires `USEARCH v7.0 <http://www.drive5.com/usearch>`__\n   or `vsearch v2.3.2 <https://github.com/torognes/vsearch>`__\n+  AssemblePairs-reference requires `USEARCH v7.0 <http://www.drive5.com/usearch>`__\n   or `BLAST+ 2.5 <ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST>`__\n\nLinux\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. The simplest way to install all Python dependencies is to install the\n   full SciPy stack using the\n   `instructions <http://scipy.org/install.html>`__, then install\n   Biopython according to its\n   `instructions <http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/install/Installation.html>`__.\n\n2. Download the pRESTO bundle and run::\n\n   > pip3 install presto-x.y.z.tar.gz --user\n\nMac OS X\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Install Xcode. Available from the Apple store or\n   `developer downloads <http://developer.apple.com/downloads>`__.\n\n2. Older versions Mac OS X will require you to install XQuartz 2.7.5. Available\n   from the `XQuartz project <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing>`__.\n\n3. Install Homebrew following the installation and post-installation\n   `instructions <http://brew.sh>`__.\n\n4. Install Python 3.4.0+ and set the path to the python3 executable::\n\n   > brew install python3\n   > echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile\n\n5. Exit and reopen the terminal application so the PATH setting takes effect.\n\n6. You may, or may not, need to install gfortran (required for SciPy). Try\n   without first, as this can take an hour to install and is not needed on\n   newer releases. If you do need gfortran to install SciPy, you can install it\n   using Homebrew::\n\n   > brew install gfortran\n\n   If the above fails run this instead::\n\n   > brew install --env=std gfortran\n\n7. Install NumPy, SciPy, pandas and Biopyton using the Python package\n   manager::\n\n   > pip3 install numpy scipy pandas biopython\n\n8. Download pRESTO bundle, open a terminal window, change directories\n   to download location, and run::\n\n   > pip3 install presto-x.y.z.tar.gz\n\nWindows\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Install Python 3.4.0+ from `Python <http://python.org/downloads>`__,\n   selecting both the options 'pip' and 'Add python.exe to Path'.\n\n2. Install NumPy, SciPy, pandas and Biopython using the packages\n   available from the\n   `Unofficial Windows binary <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs>`__\n   collection.\n\n3. Download pRESTO bundle, open a Command Prompt, change directories to\n   the download folder, and run::\n\n   > pip install presto-x.y.z.tar.gz\n\n4. For a default installation of Python 3.4, the pRESTO scripts will be\n   installed into ``C:\\Python34\\Scripts`` and should be directly\n   executable from the Command Prompt. If this is not the case, then\n   follow step 5 below.\n\n5. Add both the ``C:\\Python34`` and ``C:\\Python34\\Scripts`` directories\n   to your ``%Path%``. On Windows 7 the ``%Path%`` setting is located\n   under Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Advanced\n   System Settings -> Environment variables -> System variables -> Path.\n\n6. If you have trouble with the ``.py`` file associations, try adding ``.PY``\n   to your ``PATHEXT`` environment variable. Also, opening a\n   command prompt as Administrator and run::\n\n    > assoc .py=Python.File\n    > ftype Python.File=\"C:\\Python34\\python.exe\" \"%1\" %*\n\n\nRelease Notes\n================================================================================\n\nVersion 0.5.5:  December 26, 2017\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAssemblePairs:\n\n+ Fixed a bug that caused the ``align`` subcommand to error if input sequences\n  where shorter than the minimum specified by the `--minlen` argument. It will\n  now simply fail such sequences.\n\nClusterSets:\n\n+ Moved functionality of previous ClusterSets command into the ``set``\n  subcommand.\n+ Added the ``all`` subcommand to cluster all sequences without considering\n  annotation groups.\n+ Added the ``barcode`` subcommand which allows for clustering of reads\n  based on a barcode sequence instead of the read data.\n+ Renamed ``-id`` argument to ``--ident`` for consistency with AssemblePairs.\n\nCollapseSeq:\n\n+ Fixed a bug wherein CollapseSeq would match partial sequences against longer\n  sequences that were otherwise identical up until the missing end characters.\n+ Added detailed log output.\n\nEstimateError:\n\n+ Fixed a division by zero warning in the log output when there were no\n  observed mismatches.\n\nUnifyHeaders:\n\n+ New tool to generate consensus annotations or filter reads based on\n  annotation groupings.\n\n\nVersion 0.5.4:  July 1, 2017\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n+ All tools will now print detailed help if no arguments are provided.\n\nAlignSets:\n\n+ Fixed a typo in the console log of the muscle subcommand.\n\nConvertHeaders:\n\n+ Added the ``migec`` subcommand to convert headers from the MIGEC tool.\n\nEstimateError:\n\n+ Fixed a division by zero error when there were no observed mismatches.\n+ Bounded error rate to a minimum of 10^-9 (Q=90).\n\n\nVersion 0.5.3:  February 14, 2017\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLicense changed to Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International\n(CC BY-SA 4.0).\n\nAssemblePairs:\n\n+ Changed the behavior of the ``--failed`` argument so that failed output\n  are in the same orientation as the input sequences. Meaning, the ``--rc``\n  argument is ignored for failed output.\n+ Added the sequential subcommand which will first attempt de novo assembly\n  (align subcommand) following by reference guided assembly (reference\n  subcommand) if de novo assembly fails.\n+ Added blastn compatibility to reference subcommand.\n+ Added the option ``--aligner`` to the reference subcommand to allow use of\n  either blastn or usearch for performing the local alignment. Defaults to\n  the usearch algorithm used in previous releases.\n+ Added the option ``--dbexec`` to the reference subcommand to allow\n  specification of the reference database build tool (eg, makeblastdb).\n+ Changed masking behavior to ``none`` and word length to ``9`` in reference\n  subcommand when using usearch as the aligner.\n+ Internal modifications to the reference subcommand to rebuild the database\n  before alignments for performance reasons.\n+ Fixed a deprecation warning appearing with newer versions of numpy.\n\nBuildConsensus:\n\n+ Fixed a bug in the read group error rate calculation wherein either a\n  consensus sequence or read group that was completely N characters would\n  cause the program to exit with a division by zero error. Now, such\n  non-informative read groups will be assigned an error rate of 1.0.\n\nClusterSets:\n\n+ Added vsearch compatibility.\n+ Fixed a bug wherein sets containing empty sequences were being fed to\n  usearch, rather than automatically failed, which would cause usearch v8 to\n  hang indefinitely.\n+ Fixed an incompatibility with usearch v9 due to changes in the way usearch\n  outputs sequence labels.\n+ Changed masking behavior of usearch to ``none``.\n+ Changed how gaps are handling before passing sequences to usearch. Gaps are\n  now masked (with Ns) for clustering, instead of removed.\n\nEstimateError:\n\n+ Fixed a fatal error with newer versions of pandas.\n\nSplitSeq:\n\n+ Added the select subcommand, which allows filtering of sequences based on\n  annotation value matches or mismatches.\n+ Altered the behavior of the ``-u`` argument for both the sample and\n  samplepair subcommands. If ``-u`` is specified, sampling is performed as in\n  previous versions wherein samples will be drawn from only fields with the\n  specified annotation values up to ``n`` total reads. However, if ``-u``\n  is not specified with ``-f`` repeated sampling will now be performed for\n  each unique annotation value in the specified field, generating output\n  with up to ``n`` reads per unique annotation value.\n\n\nVersion 0.5.2:  March 8, 2016\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFixed a bug with installation on Windows due to old file paths lingering in\npresto.egg-info/SOURCES.txt.\n\nImprovements to commandline usage help messages.\n\nUpdated license from CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 to CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nAssemblePairs:\n\n+ Added the flag ``--fill`` to the reference subcommand to allow insertion of \n  the reference sequence into the non-overlapping region of assembled \n  sequences. Use caution when using this flag, as this may lead to chimeric \n  sequences.\n+ Changed default ``--minlen`` to 8 in align subcommand.\n\n\nVersion 0.5.1:  December 4, 2015\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nClusterSets:\n\n+ Fixed bug wherein ``--failed`` flag did not work.\n\n\nVersion 0.5.0:  September 7, 2015\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConversion to a proper Python package which uses pip and setuptools for \ninstallation.\n\nThe package now requires Python 3.4. Python 2.7 is not longer supported.\n\nThe required dependency versions have been bumped to numpy 1.8, scipy 0.14,\npandas 0.15, and biopython 1.65.\n\nIgCore:\n\n+ Divided IgCore functionality into the separate modules: Annotation, \n  Commandline, Defaults, IO, Multiprocessing and Sequence.\n\n\nVersion 0.4.8:  September 7, 2015\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdded support for additional input FASTA (.fna, .fa), FASTQ (.fq) and \ntab-delimited (.tsv) file extensions.\n\nParseHeaders:\n\n+ Fixed a bug in the rename subcommand wherein renaming to an existing field\n  deleted the old annotation, but did not merge the renamed annotation into\n  the existing field.\n+ Added the copy subcommand which will copy annotations into new field names\n  or merge the annotations of existing fields.\n+ Added the ``--act`` argument to the copy and rename subcommands allowing \n  collapse following the copy or rename operation.\n+ Added a commandline check to ensure that the ``-f``, ``-k`` and ``--act`` \n  arguments contain the same number of fields for both the rename and copy \n  subcommands.\n\n\nVersion 0.4.7:  June 5, 2015\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIgCore:\n\n+ Modified scoring functions to permit asymmetrical scores for N and gap \n  characters.\n  \nAssemblePairs:\n\n+ Added support for SRA style coordinate information where the where the read \n  number has been appended to the spot number.\n+ Altered scoring so gap characters are counted as mismatches in the error \n  rate and identity calculations.\n\nBuildConsensus:\n\n+ Altered scoring so gap characters are counted as mismatches in the diversity \n  and error rate calculations.\n\nConvertHeaders:\n\n+ Added support for SRA style sequence headers where the read number has been \n  appended to the spot number; eg, output from \n  ``fastq-dump -I --split-files file.sra``.\n\nClusterSets:\n\n+ Added missing OUTPUT console log field.\n+ Changed ``--bf`` and ``--cf`` arguments to ``-f`` and ``-k``, respectively.\n\nMaskPrimers:\n\n+ Altering scoring behavior for N characters such that Ns in the input sequence \n  are always counted as a mismatch, while Ns in the primer sequence are counted \n  as a match, with priority given to the input sequence score.\n+ Added ``--gap`` argument to the align subcommand which allows users to \n  specify the gap open and gap extension penalties for aligning primers. \n  Note:  gap penalties reduce the match count for purposes of calculating ERROR.\n\nPairSeq:\n\n+ Added support for SRA style coordinate information where the where the read \n  number has been appended to the spot number.\n\n\nVersion 0.4.6:  May 13, 2015\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBuildConsensus:\n\n+ Changed ``--maxmiss`` argument to ``--maxgap`` and altered the behavior to \n  only perform deletion of positions based on gap characters (only \"-\" or \".\"\n  and not \"N\" characters).\n+ Added an error rate (``--maxerror``) calculation based on mismatches from \n  consensus. The ``--maxerror`` argument is mutually exclusive with the \n  ``--maxdiv`` argument and provides similar functionality. However, the \n  calculations are not equivalent, and ``--maxerror`` should be considerably \n  faster than ``--maxdiv``.\n+ Added exclusion of positions from the error rate calculation that are deleted\n  due to exceeding the ``--maxgap`` threshold .\n+ Fixed misalignment of consensus sequence against input sequences when\n  positions are deleted due to exceeding the ``--maxgap`` threshold.\n\nClusterSets:\n\n+ New script to cluster read groups by barcode field (eg, UID barcodes) into\n  clustering within the read group.\n\nConvertHeaders:\n\n+ New script to handle conversion of different sequence description formats \n  to the pRESTO format.\n  \nFilterSeq:\n\n+ Added count of masked characters to log output of maskqual subcommand.\n+ Changed repeats subcommand log field REPEAT to REPEATS.\n\nPairSeq:\n\n+ Changed ``-f`` argument to ``--1f`` argument.\n+ Added ``--2f`` argument to copy file 2 annotations to file 1.\n\nParseHeaders:\n\n+ Moved convert subcommand to the generic subcommand of the new ConvertHeaders \n  script and modified the conversion behavior.\n\n\nVersion 0.4.5:  March 20, 2015\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdded details to the usage documentation for each tool which describes both\nthe output files and annotation fields.\n\nRenamed ``--clean`` argument to ``--failed`` argument with opposite behavior, \nsuch that the default behavior of all scripts is now clean output.\n\nIgCore:\n\n+ Features added for Change-O compatibility.\n+ Features added for PairSeq performance improvements.\n+ Added custom help formatter.\n+ Modifications to internals of multiprocessing code.\n+ Fixed a few typos in error messages.\n\nAssemblePairs:\n\n+ Added reference subcommand which uses V-region germline alignments from\n  ublast to assemble paired-ends.\n+ Removed mate-pair matching operation to increase performance. Now requires\n  both input files to contain matched and uniformly ordered reads. If files\n  are not synchronized then PairSeq must be run first. AssemblePairs will\n  check that coordinate info matches and error if the files are not\n  synchronized. Unpaired reads are no longer output.\n+ Added support for cases where one mate pair is the subsequence of the other.\n+ Added ``--scanrev`` argument to allow for head sequence to overhang end of \n  tail.\n+ Removed truncated (quick) error calculation in align subcommand.\n+ Changed default values of the ``--maxerror`` and ``--alpha`` arguments of \n  the align subcommand to better tuned parameters.\n+ Changed internal selection of top scoring alignment to use Z-score\n  approximation rather than a combination of error rate and binomial\n  mid-p value.\n+ Internal changes to multiprocessing structure.\n+ Changed inserted gap character from - to N in join subcommand for better\n  compatibility with the behavior of IMGT/HighV-QUEST.\n+ Changed PVAL log field to PVALUE.\n+ Changed HEADSEQ and TAILSEQ log fields to SEQ1 and SEQ2.\n+ Changed HEADFIELDS and TAILFIELDS log fields to FIELDS1 and FIELDS2.\n+ Changed precision of ERROR and PVALUE log fields.\n+ Added more verbose logging.\n\nBuildConsensus:\n\n+ Fixed bug where low quality positions where not being masked in single\n  sequence barcode groups.\n+ Added copy field (``--cf``) and copy action (``--act``) arguments to generate\n  consensus annotations for barcode read groups.\n+ Changed maximum consensus quality score from 93 to 90.\n\nCollapseSeq:\n\n+ Added ``--keep`` argument to allow retention of sequences with high missing \n  character counts in unique sequence output file.\n+ Removed case insensitivity for performance reasons. Now requires all \n  sequences to have matching case.\n+ Removed ``first`` and ``last`` from ``--act`` choices to avoid unexpected \n  behavior.\n\nMaskPrimers:\n\n+ Changed behavior of N characters in primer identification. Ns now count as a\n  match against any character, rather than a mismatch.\n+ Changed behavior of mask mode such that positions masked with Ns are now\n  assigned quality scores of 0, rather than retaining their previous scores.\n+ Fixed a bug with the align subcommand where deletions within the input\n  sequence (gaps in the alignment) were causing an incorrect barcode start\n  position.\n\nPairSeq:\n\n+ Performance improvements. The tool should now be considerably faster on very\n  large files.\n+ Specifying the ``--failed`` argument to request output of sequences which \n  do not have a mate pair will increase run time and memory usage.\n\nParseHeaders:\n\n+ Add 'cat' action to collapse subcommand which concatenates strings into\n  a single annotation.\n\nSplitSeq:\n\n+ Removed ``--clean`` (and ``--failed``) flag from all subcommands.\n+ Added progress updates to sample and samplepair subcommands.\n+ Performance improvements to samplepair subcommand.\n\n\nVersion 0.4.4:  June 10, 2014\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSplitSeq:\n\n+ Removed a linux-specific dependency, allowing SplitSeq to work on Windows.\n\nVersion 0.4.3:  April 7, 2014\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCollapseSeq:\n\n+ Fixed bug that occurs with Python 2.7.5 on OS X.\n\nSplitSeq:\n\n+ Fixed bug in samplepairs subcommand that occurs with Python 2.7.5 on OS X.\n\n\nVersion 0.4.2:  March 20, 2014\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIncreased verbosity of exception reporting.\n\nIgCore:\n\n+ Updates to consensus functions to support changes to BuildConsensus.\n\nAssemblePairs:\n\n+ Set default alpha to 0.01.\n\nBuildConsensus:\n\n+ Added support for ``--freq value`` parameter to quality consensus method\n  and set default value to 0.6.\n+ Fixed a bug in the frequency consensus method where missing values were\n  contributing to the total character count at each position.\n+ Added the parameter ``--maxmiss value`` which provides a cut-off for \n  removal of positions with too many N or gap characters .\n\nMaskPrimers:\n\n+ Renamed the ``--reverse`` parameter to ``--revpr``.\n\nSplitSeq:\n\n+ Removed convert subcommand.\n\n\nVersion 0.4.1:  January 27, 2014\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChanges to the internals of multiple tools to provide support for \nmultiprocessing in Windows environments.\n  \nChanges to the internals of multiple tools to provide clean exit of\nchild processes upon kill signal or exception in sibling process. \n\nFixed unexpected behavior of ``--outname`` and ``--log`` arguments with \nmultiple input files.\n\nIgCore:\n\n+ Added reporting of unknown exceptions when reading sequence files\n+ Fixed scoring of lowercase sequences.\n\nAlignSets:\n\n+ Fixed a typo in the log output.\n\nBuildConsensus:\n\n+ Fixed a typo in the log output.\n\nEstimateError:\n\n+ Fixed bug where tool would improperly exit if no sets passed threshold\n  criteria.\n+ Fixed typo in console output.\n\nMaskPrimers:\n\n+ Added ``trim`` mode which will cut the region before primer alignment, but \n  leave primer region unmodified.\n+ Fixed a bug with lowercase sequence data.\n+ Fixed bug in the console and log output.\n+ Added support for primer matching when setting ``--maxerr 1.0``.\n\nParseHeaders:\n\n+ Added count of sequences without any valid fields (FAIL) to console output.\n\nParseLog:\n\n+ Added count of records without any valid fields (FAIL) to console output.\n\nSplitSeq:\n\n+ Fixed typo in console output of samplepair subcommand.\n+ Added increase of the open file limit to the group subcommand to allow for \n  a large number of groups.\n\n\nVersion 0.4.0:  September 30, 2013\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMinor name changes were made to multiple scripts, functions, parameters,\nand output files.\n\nAlignSets, AssemblePairs, BuildConsensus, EstimateError, FilterSeq, and \nMaskPrimers are now multithreaded.  The number of simultaneous processes\nmay be specified using ``--nproc value``. Note this means file ordering\nis no longer preserved between the input and output sequence files.\n\nPerformance improvements were made to several tools.\n\nThe universal ``--verbose`` parameter was replaced with ``--log file_name``\nwhich specifies a log file for verbose output, and disables verbose logging\nif not specified.  \n\nThe report of input parameters and sequence counts is now separate from the \nlog and is always printed to standard output.\n\nAdded a progress bar to the standard output of most tools.\n  \nAdded a universal ``--outname file_prefix`` parameter which changes the leading\nportion of the output file name.  If not specified, the current file name \nis used (excluding the file extension, as per the previous behavior).\n\nAdded a universal ``--clean`` parameter which if specified forces the tool \nnot to create an output file of sequences which failed processing.\n  \nIgCore:\n\n+ Changes to parameters and internals of multiple functions.\n+ Added functions to support multithreading for single-end reads, paired-end \n  reads, and barcode sets.\n+ Added safe annotation field renaming.\n+ Added progress bar, logging and output file name conversion support.\n+ Moved reusable AssemblePairs, BuildConsensus, PairSeq, and SplitSeq.\n  operations into IgCore.\n\nAssemblePairs:\n\n+ Coordinate information is now specified by a coordinate type, rather than a \n  delimiter, using the ``--coord header_type`` parameter, where the header type\n  may be one of ``illumina``, ``solexa``, ``sra``, ``454``, ``presto``.\n\nCollapseSeq:\n\n+ Sequences with a missing character count exceeding the user limit defined\n  by ``-n maximum_missing_count`` are now exported to a separate \n  ``collapse-undetermined`` output file, rather than included in the \n  ``collapse-unique`` sequence output.\n\nEstimateError:\n\n+ Now outputs error estimations for positions, quality scores, nucleotide \n  pairs, and annotation sets.  \n+ Machine reported quality scores and empirical quality scores have been added\n  to all output tables.\n\nFilterSeq:\n\n+ Added ``length`` subcommand to filter sequences by minimum length.\n\nPairSeq:\n\n+ Coordinate information has been redefined as per AssemblePairs.\n\nParseHeaders:\n\n+ Added new subcommand ``convert`` which attempts to reformat sequence headers \n  into the pRESTO format.\n+ The ``rename`` subcommand will now append entries if the new field name already\n  exists in the sequence header, rather than replace the entry.\n\n\nVersion 0.3 (prerelease 6):  August 13, 2013\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nToolkit is now dependent upon pandas 0.12 for the estimateError tool.\n\nalignSets:\n\n+ Changed MUSCLE execution to faster settings (``-diags``, ``-maxiters 2``).\n\nfilterQuality:\n\n+ Added ``repeat`` subcommand to filter sequences with ``-n (value)`` repetitions \n  of a single character and. \n+ Changed ``-n`` parameter of ``ambig`` subcommand from fractional value to a \n  raw count.\n\nestimateError:\n\n+ New tool which estimates error of sequence sets by comparison to a consensus.\n\nmaskPrimers:\n\n+ Bug fixes to alignment position calculation of ``align`` subcommand when primer\n  alignment begins before start of sequence.\n+ Removed ``--ann`` parameter.\n\n\n\nVersion 0.3 (prerelease 5):  August 7, 2013\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLicense changed to Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 \nUnported License.\n\nIgPipeline Core:\n\n+ Bug fixes to diversity calculation.\n+ Added support for files where all sequences do not share the same annotation \n  fields.\n+ Added support for alternate scoring of gap and N-valued nucleotides.\n\nalignSets:\n\n+ Added ``--mode`` parameter with options of ``pad`` and ``cut`` to specify whether \n  to extend or trim read groups to the same start position.\n+ Fixed intermittent 'muscle' subcommand stdout pipe deadlock when \n  executing MUSCLE.\n\nassemblePairs:\n\n+ Added ``join`` subcommand to support library preps where paired-end reads \n  do not overlap.\n+ Speed improvements to p-value calculations.\n\nbuildConsensus:\n\n+ ``--div`` parameter converted to ``--maxdiv value`` to allow filtering of read \n  groups by diversity.\n+ Bug fixes to nucleotide frequency consensus method.\n+ ``-q`` parameter renamed to ``--qual``.\n\ncollapseSequences:\n\n+ Added support for files where all sequences do not share the same annotation \n  fields.\n\nsplitSeqFile:\n\n+ ``samplepair`` subcommand added to allow random sampling from paired-end \n  file sets.\n+ The behavior of the ``-c`` parameter of the ``sample`` and ``samplepair`` \n  subcommands changed to allow multiple samplings with the same command.\n\n\nVersion 0.3 (prerelease 4):  May 18, 2013\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInitial public prerelease\n",
