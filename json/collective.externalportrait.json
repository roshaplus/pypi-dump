    "description": "Introduction\n============\n\nYou can use this product to show avatar pictures of your users from external sites, i.e. from gravatar.\n\nTo do this you set a list of URLs where the avatars can be found. The default uses gravatar.\n\nhttp://www.gravatar.com/avatar/%(emailmd5hash)s?s=200&d=mm\n\nThe %(emailmd5hash)s part can be replaced with %(fullname)s, %(home_page)s, %(username)s\nor any variable that is available from the MembershipTool.getMemberInfo() dictionary on your site.\nSo another example would be\n\nhttp://my.site.com/%(username)/picture\n\nThe product also tries to set the facebookid variable for the MembershipTool.getMemberInfo() dictionary.\nSo, if plonesocial.auth.rpx is installed and the user uses facebook to login, you can also use\n\nhttps://graph.facebook.com/%(facebookid)s/picture\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n0.1dev (unreleased)\n-------------------\n\n- Initial release",
