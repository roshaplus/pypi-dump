    "description": "# ICemu - Emulate Integrated Circuits\n\n`icemu` is a Python library that emulates integrated circuits at the logic level. For example,\nif you want to simulate a circuit with a decoder driving the clock pin of two shift registers,\nit would look like this:\n\n    dec = SN74HC138()\n    sr1 = CD74AC164()\n    sr2 = CD74AC164()\n    mcu_pin = OutputPin('PB4')\n\n    sr1.pin_CP.wire_to(dec.pin_Y0)\n    sr2.pin_CP.wire_to(dec.pin_Y1)\n    sr1.pin_DS1.wire_to(mcu_pin)\n    sr2.pin_DS1.wire_to(mcu_pin)\n\n    dec.update()\n    sr1.update()\n    sr2.update()\n\nYou could then play with pins at your heart contents and call `update()` when you want pin state\nto \"propagate\" through wires and IC logic.\n\n## See it in action\n\nHere's a little video of `icemu` used in my [solar-timer][solar-timer] project:\n\n[![asciinema](https://asciinema.org/a/8XM8TD9x1ZavzscsB2NUDYqeb.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/8XM8TD9x1ZavzscsB2NUDYqeb)\n\nThat timer has 3 7-segments led matrices driven my 3 shift registers themselves driven by a 3-8\ndecoder. These are all emulated in a virtual circuit and the output is the output of the led\nmatrices themselves.\n\n## What is it for\n\nThe goal of this library is to facilitate the testing and debugging of embedded software. When we\nrun software on an embedded prototype, it's often hard to debug failures because we don't even\nknow if the problem comes from hardware (wiring, it's always the wiring!) or software. Moreover,\ntesting directly on a prototype often involves significant setup time.\n\nWith emulation, we have a quick setup time, introspection capabilities, all this stuff. We can then\nconfirm the soundness of our logic before sending it to our prototype.\n\n## Why Python\n\nBecause it's used for debugging purposes, speed is not essential. Also, Python is easy to glue\nwith C.\n\nI've tried writing quick `icemu` prototype in C and Rust, but they were needlessly complicated.\nWith Python, it's easy to write the software and add new chips. Because there's gonna be a *lot*\nof these chips to add, we might as well make this process as fast as possible.\n\n## How to use\n\nYou can install `icemu` with pip on python **3.4+**:\n\n    $ pip install --user icemu\n\nThen, you need to recreate your prototype's logic in a small Python program that uses `icemu` and\nwrap that into easy to use functions. Those functions should be designed to receive pin state\nchange from the MCU and apply the logic change into your circuit. Make that program print relevant\ninformation so that you can assert your logic's soundness.\n\nThen, write yourself a small Hardware Abstraction Layer at the pin/register level, embed your\nPython program like a regular C application would do, make your `ifdef`ed functions call helper\nfunctions you've written in your Python program, compile and run!\n\n## Examples\n\nYou can find small examples is the `tests` folders, but the best way to get the grand idea is to\nlook at a project that uses it such as my [solar-timer][solar-timer]. Read the Simulation part of\nthe README to get started.\n\n## License\n\nLGPLv3, Copyright 2017 Virgil Dupras\n\n[solar-timer]: https://github.com/hsoft/solar-timer\n",
