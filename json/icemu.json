    "description": "# ICemu - Emulate Integrated Circuits\n\n`icemu` is a Python library that emulates integrated circuits at the logic level. For example,\nif you want to simulate a circuit with a decoder driving the clock pin of two shift registers,\nit would look like this:\n\n    dec = SN74HC138()\n    sr1 = CD74AC164()\n    sr2 = CD74AC164()\n    mcu_pin = OutputPin('PB4')\n\n    sr1.pin_CP.wire_to(dec.pin_Y0)\n    sr2.pin_CP.wire_to(dec.pin_Y1)\n    sr1.pin_DS1.wire_to(mcu_pin)\n    sr2.pin_DS1.wire_to(mcu_pin)\n\n    dec.update()\n    sr1.update()\n    sr2.update()\n\nYou could then play with pins at your heart contents and call `update()` when you want pin state\nto \"propagate\" through wires and IC logic.\n\n## What is it for\n\nThe goal of this library is to facilitate the testing and debugging of embedded software. When we\nrun software on an embedded prototype, it's often hard to debug failures because we don't even\nknow if the problem comes from hardware (wiring, it's always the wiring!) or software. Moreover,\ntesting directly on a prototype often involves significant setup time.\n\nWith emulation, we have a quick setup time, introspection capabilities, all this stuff. We can then\nconfirm the soundness of our logic before sending it to our prototype.\n\n## Why Python\n\nBecause it's used for debugging purposes, speed is not essential. Also, Python is easy to glue\nwith C.\n\nI've tried writing quick `icemu` prototype in C and Rust, but they were needlessly complicated.\nWith Python, it's easy to write the software and add new chips. Because there's gonna be a *lot*\nof these chips to add, we might as well make this process as fast as possible.\n\n## How to use\n\nWhat you would do would be to recreate your prototype's logic in a small Python program that uses\n`icemu` and wrap that into easy to use functions. Those functions should be designed to receive\npin state change from the MCU and apply the logic change into your circuit. Make that program\nprint relevant information so that you can assert your logic's soundness.\n\nThen, write yourself a small Hardware Abstraction Layer at the pin/register level, embed your\nPython program like a regular C application would do, make your `ifdef`ed functions call helper\nfunctions you've written in your Python program, compile and run!\n\n## Examples\n\nThe best place to find examples is the `tests` folders. You'll find all kinds of circuits.\n\n## License\n\nLGPLv3, Copyright 2017 Virgil Dupras\n",
