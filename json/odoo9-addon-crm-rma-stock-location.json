Adding for the\ndifferent product views (Tree, Form and Kanban) information about it.\n\nBoth quantities are computed and include its children locations.\n\nIt is useful to use it as a quick snapshot for RMA from product perspective.\n\nIt also adds the following location on warehouses :\n\n * Loss\n * Refurbished\n\nSeveral wizards on incoming deliveries that allow you to move your\ngoods easily in those new locations from a done reception.\n\nUsing this module make the logistic flow of return a bit more complex:\n\n * Returning product goes into RMA location with a incoming shipment\n * From the incoming shipment, forward them to another places (stock, loss, refurbish)\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nTo install this module, just select it from availables modules.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nNo configuration is needed\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n* Go to Sales > After-sale Services and note that 'RMA Quantity On Hand' and\n  'RMA Forecasted Quantity' has been included and they'll be shown when at least\n  when a product has either on hand or forecasted quantities available.\n\n* In the other hand, it provides three wizards to make stock moves (transfers)\n  allowing to do product returns (incoming), send a product to loss or, to a refurbished\n  location.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/145/9.0\n\nFor further information, please visit:\n\n* https://www.odoo.com/forum/help-1\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* Optimization is possible when searching virtual quantities in the search function\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/rma/issues>`_.
