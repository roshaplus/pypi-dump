    "description": "CMakeHelp\r\n=========\r\n\r\n\r\nCMake is a great build system and it has comprehensive reference\r\ndocumentation, but if you have used the documentation (either online or\r\nbuild into cmake) after a while of searching for help becomes tiresome\r\nespecially if you wan't to find what you are looking for fast.\r\n\r\nThat's why I created this small utility that enables you to quickly\r\nsearch and read CMake's documentation.\r\n\r\nThe utility is a interactive command line where you can Tab your way\r\nto the documentation you wan.\r\n\r\nThe following commands are available to you ::\r\n\r\n    command   -  Print help for a single command\r\n    module    -  Print help for a single module\r\n    property  -  Print help for a single property\r\n    variable  -  Print help for a single variable\r\n\r\nTo get a list of available elments use Tab completetion ::\r\n\r\n    [CMake Help] command fi<TAB>\r\n    file          find_file     find_library  \r\n\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThis utility was developed on a Linux based system, so it\r\nmost likely will work on most Unix based systems where\r\nCMake is available. There are only two requirements apart\r\nfrom python that this utility requires. You need the \r\ncmake executable available on you system path and the\r\nless pasger.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no unit tests and the amount of testing\r\ndone was very minimal so there might be some bugs.\r\n\r\nIf command completion does not work there might be 2 causes,\r\neither you don't have readline or there was a problem while\r\ngetting keywords from cmake. No error is printed if cmake\r\nwas executed incorectly(all exceptions are caught during\r\ncommand completion)...",
