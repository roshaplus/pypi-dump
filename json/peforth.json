We all do.\nBut when it comes to Machine Learning and Tensorflow or the likes, \nthings are getting annoying if we were still using traditional debuggers.\nA programmable debugger is what in my mind and probably in yours too. \nOne breakpoint to investigate about everything with procedures that we\ncome out at the point depend on variant needs of emerged ideas good or bad.\n\nDebug commands in FORTH syntax\n##############################\n\nSo now we need to choose an interactive UI and its syntax that \nis light weight, reliable and flexible so we won't regret of choosing it \nsomeday, has been there for decades so many people don't need to learn about \nanother new language although we are only to use some debug commands, yet easy \nenough for new users, that's FORTH. \n\nInstall peforth\n###############\n\n::\n\n    pip install peforth \n\nRun peforth:\n#############\n\nPrint \"Hello World!\"\n\n::\n\n    Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.15063]\n    (c) 2017 Microsoft Corporation.

Let's use the above example\nagain in another way to demonstrate how to do that with peforth:  \n\nRun peforth:\n\n::\n\n    Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.15063]\n    (c) 2017 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\n\n    c:\\Users\\your-working-folder>python\n    Python 3.6.0 (v3.6.0:41df79263a11, Dec 23 2016, 08:06:12) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32\n    Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n    >>> import peforth\n    p e f o r t h    v1.07\n    source code http://github.com/hcchengithub/peforth\n    Type 'peforth.ok()' to enter forth interpreter, 'exit' to come back.\n\n    >>> peforth.ok()\n\n    OK   <-------- Default FORTH command prompt\n    OK    \n\nAssume we are at a breakpoint and we need a procedure to\nadd 1..100 to get the sum of them. We are not sure if the procedure\nis correct so we need to try. Now copy the procedure from \nyour text editor. The ``` <py>...</py> ``` tells the debugger that \nthe code within is a block of in-line python. \nThe ```outport()``` function outports the given ```locals()``` to the\nFORTH environment outside the in-line python block.\n\n::\n\n    <py>\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(100):\n        sum += i\n    print(\"The sum of 1..100 is \", sum)\n    outport(locals())\n    </py>\n\nIt's a block of multiple-line text strings so we press Ctrl-D\nto start a multiple-line input, copy-paste, and press another Ctrl-D\nto end the multiple-line block. Like this:\n\n::\n\n    OK\n    OK ^D\n        <py>\n        sum = 0\n        for i in range(100):\n            sum += i\n        print(\"The sum of 1..100 is \", sum)\n        outport(locals())\n        </py>\n    ^D\n    The sum of 1..100 is  4950\n    OK\n\nNow use the 'words' command to see what have we got:\n\n::\n\n    OK words\n    code end-code \\ // <selftest> </selftest> bye /// immediate stop compyle \n    trim indent -indent <py> </py> </pyV> words . cr help interpret-only \n    compile-only literal reveal privacy (create) : ; ( BL CR word ' , \n    [compile] py: py> py:~ py>~ 0branch here! here swap ! @ ? >r r> r@ drop \n    dup over 0< + * - / 1+ 2+ 1- 2- compile if then compiling char last \n    version execute cls private nonprivate (space) exit ret rescan-word-hash \n    (') branch bool and or not (forget) AND OR NOT XOR true false \"\" [] {} \n    none >> << 0= 0> 0<> 0<= 0>= = == > < != >= <= abs max min doVar doNext \n    depth pick roll space [ ] colon-word create (marker) marker next abort \n    alias <> public nip rot -rot 2drop 2dup invert negate within ['] allot \n    for begin until again ahead never repeat aft else while ?stop ?dup \n    variable +! chars spaces .( .\" .' s\" s' s` does> count accept accept2 \n    <accept> nop </accept> refill [else] [if] [then] (::) (:>) :: :> ::~ \n    :>~ \"msg\"abort abort\" \"msg\"?abort ?abort\" '<text> (<text>) <text> </text> \n    <comment> </comment> (constant) constant value to tib. >t t@ t> [begin] \n    [again] [until] [for] [next] modules int float drops dropall char>ASCII \n    ASCII>char ASCII .s (*debug*) *debug* readTextFile writeTextFile \n    tib.insert sinclude include type obj>keys obj2dict stringify toString \n    .literal .function (dump) dump dump2ret d (see) .members .source see dos \n    cd slice description expected_rstack expected_stack test-result \n    [all-pass] *** all-pass [r r] [d d] [p p] WshShell inport OK dir keys \n    --- i sum\n    OK\n\nAround the end of the long list after the ``` --- ``` marker we found ``` i ``` and \n``` sum ```. They are all locals() at the point in the in-line python block.\nLet's see them:\n\n::\n\n    OK i . cr\n    99\n    OK sum . cr\n    4950\n    OK\n\nAgain, we found the root cause of why the sum is not 5050 because\n``` i ``` didn't reach to 100 as anticipated. That's exactly how the \npython ```range()``` works and that has actually confused me many times.\n\n\nVisit this project's \n`Wiki`_\npages\nfor more examples about how to view MNIST handwritten digit images\nat the half way of your investigating in a Tensorflow tutorial, for\nexample, and the usages of this programmable debugger.\n\nHave fun!\n*********\n\n- H.C.
