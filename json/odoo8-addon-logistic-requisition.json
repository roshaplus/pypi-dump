    "description": "This module allows you to manage your Logistics Requisitions.\n=============================================================\n\nA Logistics requisition express a need that is requested somewhere.\nIt allows to manage the sourcing of the needs before making a cost estimate to\nthe requestor.\n\nThis invert the logic that is in standard in Odoo in the way that the sourcing\nof the procurement is made before the order confirmation and we built the link\nin case of validation. In standard, the SO confirmation generate the procurement\nthen it generate the needed procurement.\n\nThe sourcing can be of various type:\n\n* Warehouse dispatch: You will deliver the requested goods from one of your\n  stock location\n* Go for tender: You will go for tender to chose the best supplier for the\n  required goods\n* Use Existing Bid: You will reuse an existing winning bid from a former\n  tender.\n* Framework agreement: You will use the existing Framework agreement\n* Other: Nothing of those choices. In that case, the line can be selected\n  and included in either a PO or a tender\n\nThe simple process is the following:\n\n* LR are recorded to represent the need of the customer/requestor\n* LR are confirmed and sourced by different way (dispatch, tender, ..)\n* If sourced from tender, you need to go all along the tendering process\n  (CBA).\n\nOnce you chose one bid, the system will automatically put back the prices\ninformation on the sourcing line of the LR.\n\n* You can create a cost estimate from sourced LR lines for your\n  resquestor/customer\n* If the requestor accepts the cost estimate, his validation will\n  automatically:\n\n   * Create the link between the chosen winning bid and the line sourced this\n     way. A new draft PO will be generated and managed as drop shipping.\n   * Lines sourced as a dispatch will create a delivery order.\n   * Lines sourced a LTA will create a PO of type LTA\n\nContributors\n------------\n* Jo\u00ebl Grand-Guillaume <joel.grandguillaume@camptocamp.com>\n* Jacques-Etienne Baudoux <je@bcim.be>\n* Guewen Baconnier <guewen.baconnier@camptocamp.com>\n* Nicolas Bessi <nicolas.bessi@camptocamp.com>\n* Yannick Vaucher <yannick.vaucher@camptocamp.com>",
