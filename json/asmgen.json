    "description": "===========\nAsmGen\n===========\n\n\n\nAbstract\n========\n\nAsmGen - code generator for sprites, fonts, and images for Apple ][ hi-res and\nAtari 8-bit computers\n\nThis program creates 6502 (or 65c02) code that draws sprites using unrolled\nloops for each shifted shape. By removing data shifts, image lookups, and loops\nthe images can be drawn much faster than otherwise possible.\n\nOther utilities include generating code for reporting screen damage, a fast\nbitmap font renderer, and generation for all the row/column lookup tables for\neach supported bitmap mode.\n\n\nInstalling From Source\n======================\n\nThe autogenerator code is written in Python and should run on any platform\nthat can use python\n\nPrerequisites\n-------------\n\n* python 2.7 (but not 3.x yet)\n* numpy\n* pypng\n\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nThe sample font is modified from Michael Pohoreski's excellent tutorial on\nApple II fonts: https://github.com/Michaelangel007/apple2_hgr_font_tutorial\n\n\nDisclaimer\n==========\n\nAsmGen, the 6502 code generator sponsored by the Player/Missile Podcast\nCopyright (c) 2017 Rob McMullen (feedback@playermissile.com)\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
