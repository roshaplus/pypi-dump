    "description": "The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of\npython source code for projects such as pychecker, pyreverse,\npylint... Well, actually the development of this library is essentialy\ngoverned by pylint's needs.\n\nIt extends class defined in the compiler.ast [1] module with some\nadditional methods and attributes. Instance attributes are added by a\nbuilder object, which can either generate extended ast (let's call\nthem astng ;) by visiting an existant ast tree or by inspecting living\nobject. Methods are added by monkey patching ast classes.",
