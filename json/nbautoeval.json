    "description": "# `nbautoeval`\n\n`nbautoeval` is a very lightweight python framework for creating **auto-evaluated** exercises inside a jupyter (python) notebook.\n\nGiven a text that describes the expectations, students are invited to write their own code, \nand can then see the outcome on teacher-defined data samples, compared with the results obtained through a teacher-provided solution, with a visual feedback.\n\nAt this point, due to lack of knowledge/documentation about open/edx (read: the version running at FUN), there is no available code for exporting the results as grades or anything similar (hence the `autoeval` name).\n\nThere indeed are provisions in the code to accumulate statistics on all attempted corrections, as an attempt to provide feedback to teachers.\n\n# Try it on `mybinder`\n\nClick the badge below to see a few sample demos under `mybinder.org` - it's all in the `demo-notebooks` subdir.\n\n[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/parmentelat/nbautoeval)\n\n\n# History\n\nThis was initially embedded into a [MOOC on python2](https://github.com/parmentelat/flotpython) \nthat ran for the first time on [the French FUN platform](https://www.france-universite-numerique-mooc.fr/) in Fall 2014. \nIt was then duplicated into a [MOOC on bioinformatics](https://github.com/parmentelat/flotbioinfo) \nin Spring 2016 where it was named `nbautoeval` for the first time, but still embedded in a greater git module.\n\nThe current git repo is created in June 2016 from that basis, with the intention to be used as a submodule from these 2 repos, \nand possibly others since a few people have proved interested.\n\n# Requirements\n\nTarget currently is any python-based notebook running on jupyter-v4. It is not quite clear at this moment which version(s) \nspecifically will work smoothly with `nbautoeval`, but in essence there is very little dependency to the jupyter version.\n\nIt was initially written in python2 but should be oblivious to a change of version to python3.\n\n# Installation\n\nInitially, `nbautoeval` was used in MOOC courses, that in turn were\nimplemented as git repos; in this context `nbautoeval` was simply\ninjected in this code using git *subtree*.\n\nIt is now also available at pypi\n\n```\npip install nbautoeval\n```\n\n# Overview\n\nIn this early stage the framework supports the following types of exercises\n  * `ExerciseFunction` : the student is asked to write a function\n  * `ExerciseRegexp` : the student is asked to write a regular expression\n  * `ExerciseClass` : tests will happen on a class implementation\n\nA teacher who wishes to implement an exercise needs to write 2 parts :\n\n* One python file that defines an instance of an exercise class. This in a nutshell typically involves\n  * providing one solution (let's say a function) written in python\n  * providing a set of input data\n  * plus optionnally various tweaks for rendering the results\n\n* One notebook that imports this exercise object, and can then take advantage of it to write jupyter cells that typically\n  * invoke `example` on  the  exercise  object to show examples of the expected output\n  * invite the student to write their own code\n  * invoke `correction` on  the  exercise  object to display the outcome.\n\n# Known issues\n\n* there remains some hard-wired labels in French\n* the regexp-based exercises come in too many variants and are thus not very well tested\n\n\n",
