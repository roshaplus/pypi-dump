    "description": "Image Mosaics for Astronomers\r\n\r\nMontage is a toolkit for assembling Flexible Image Transport System\r\n(FITS) images into custom mosaics.\r\n\r\nMontage has been tested by the Montage team on Linux platforms with\r\nmosaics built from the 2-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) Atlas\r\n(full-resolution) images. It has been built, tested and the output\r\nproducts validated by Montage customers on Unix platforms, including\r\nLinux, Solaris, Mac OSX, and IBM AIX. It has been used to generate\r\nmosaics from data released by the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Hubble\r\nSpace Telescope, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), the\r\nMidcourse Space Experiment (MSX), the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS),\r\nand ground-based telescopes such as the National Optical Astronomy\r\nObservatories (NOAO) 4-m telescope and the William Herschel 4-m\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\nMontage has also been used to test workflow frameworks on\r\nsupercomputers and cloud systems.\r\n\r\nUnder a new grant, Montage is being extended to deal with astronomical\r\ndata cubes and packaged for use on cloud computing resources. The\r\ncurrent fileset has been uploaded here in preparation for that work and\r\nconsists of the original release with some update and additions that\r\nhave been made over the years but not officially released.\r\n\r\nThis Python library wraps the Montage mViewer module (plus a few other\r\nMontage support tools) for use in viewing astronomical image data\r\nand overlays.  FITS images or datacube planes can be displayed, \r\noverlaid with catalogs, image outlines, coordinate grids, etc. \r\nThere is support for interactive zooming and feedback and the result\r\ncan be exported to PNG/JPEG files for distribution and publishing.\r\n\r\nThe Montage package (including the Python wrapper) can be downloaded\r\nfrom GitHub:\r\n\r\n            https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/Montage",
