    "description": "Ocellaris\n=========\n\nOcellaris is a work in progress to make a continuous and discontinuous Galerkin FEM solver for \nmultiphase free surface flows. The current goal of the project is to simulate water entry and \nexit of objects in ocean waves with accurate capturing of the force on the object and the \nbehaviour of the free surface.\n\nOcellaris is implemented in Python and C++ with FEniCS_ as the backend for numerics, mesh and \nfinite element calculations.\n\n.. _FEniCS: https://fenicsproject.org/\n\nOcellaris is named after the `Amphiprion Ocellaris <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocellaris_clownfish>`_\nclownfish and is written as part of a PhD project at the University of Oslo.\n\n.. figure:: https://trlandet.bitbucket.io/ocellaris/_static/ocellaris_mesh_521.png\n    :align: center\n    :alt: Picture of Ocellaris\n\n    `About this image <https://trlandet.bitbucket.io/ocellaris/logo.html>`_\n\nInstallation and running\n------------------------\n\nOcellaris requires a full installation of FEniCS_ with the PETSc linear algebra backend. There is no\ninstallation other than downloading the code and running the following command with both the Ocellaris\nPython package and the FEniCS and SciPy packages in the Python PATH (dolfin/numpy/matplotlib etc)::\n\n  python -m ocellaris INPUTFILE.INP\n\nTo test the code there are some demos in the ``demos/`` directory. Complete input files are provided\nfor several of the normal benchmark cases like lid driven cavity flow and the Taylor-Green vortex. More\ninformation can be found in the documentation which also contains a description of the input file format.\n\nPlease feel free to test Ocellaris, but please keep in mind:\n\n- Ocellaris is in a state of constant development and does not have a stable API or input file format\n- Ocellaris supports Python 2 only, not Python 3 (currently).\n- This is a research project, do not expect anything to work properly without testing it thoroughly first!\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\n.. TOC_STARTS_HERE  - in the Sphinx documentation a table of contents will be inserted here \n\nThe documentation can be found on the `Ocellaris web page <https://trlandet.bitbucket.io/ocellaris/>`_.\n\n..
