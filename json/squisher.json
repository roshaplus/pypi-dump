    "description": "Squisher can take a directory representing a Python package (i.e. a directory with __init__.py and so on) \r\nand \"squish\" it into a single .pyc file that you can import, or run on the command line, just like any other \r\n.py/.pyc file.\r\n\r\nThe hook is that it can be thus imported *without* necessarily having Squisher itself installed. All you do \r\nis run Squisher on a directory (or an existing zip file if you wish), and you get a single file you can \r\nimport with any normal Python installation.\r\n\r\nIt is complementary to Eggs in a way. They're good for having packages globally installed and keeping \r\nthem up-to-date, but very often you may want the simple convenience of dropping a .pyc in a directory \r\nand importing it. Furthermore, since Squished packages are just zip files with a special Python bytecode \r\nheader (and Eggs are just zipfiles with internal metadata added), you can actually run it on an Egg and \r\nget a file that can be used as an Egg *or* a Squished package just by renaming it.",
