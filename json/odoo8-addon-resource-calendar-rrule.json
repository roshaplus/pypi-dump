Per calendar, you can create rules describing the schedule in a very similar manner to what most calendaring applications use for repeating appointments (technically: iCal recurrence rules, short rrule).\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo use this module, you need to:\n\n#. go to a resource's calendar\n#. instead of filling in a day of week, fill in the repetition rule\n\nIf your user is a member of the group `Full RRules in resource calendars`, you'll see the full RRule possibilities. This is not really usable for most mere mortals, so by default, users see a week matrix where they can fill in time slots in the morning and in the afternoon. Morning starts at 8.00, and the afternoon at 13.00. In case you want to change this, set the values `resource_calendar_rrule.simplified_morning` resp. `resource_calendar_rrule.simplified_afternoon` to some float with the hours in the integer part and minutes in the fraction.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n    :alt: Try me on Runbot\n    :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/116/8.0\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* implement the rrule version of all functions in ``resource.calendar``\n* maybe also divert from current standard a bit because the current code assumes weekly repetition at many places\n* an init hook to convert existing calendars to rrules would be nice\n* allow to configure parameters via some settings wizard\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/hr/issues>`_.
