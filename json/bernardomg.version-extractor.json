    "description": "===============================\nVersion extractor\n===============================\n\nThis is a project created with the `Cookiecutter Python Library\n<https://github.com/Bernardo-MG/cookiecutter-python-library>`_ template and\nready to be used for creating a new Python library.\n\nJust check the readme and docs, to adapt them to your project, and it is done.\n\nRemember that if you want to create a new project it is better just reusing\nthe Cookiecutter Python Library template, as this will set up the initial\nproject according to a few pieces of data it will ask for.\n\n.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/bernardomg.version-extractor.svg\n    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bernardomg.version-extractor\n    :alt: Version extractor Pypi package page\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-release-blue.svg\n    :target: http://docs.bernardomg.com/bernardomg.version-extractor\n    :alt: Version extractor latest documentation Status\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-develop-blue.svg\n    :target: http://docs.bernardomg.com/development/bernardomg.version-extractor\n    :alt: Version extractor development documentation Status\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Travis configuration file\n- Customized setup.py module to minimize configuration, and using tox for the tests\n- Docs using `Sphinx`_ and the `Sphinx Docs Theme <https://github.com/Bernardo-MG/sphinx-docs-theme>`_\n- Prepared to run tests through tox\n- Prepared to run tests on Python 2 and 3\n- Prepared to run tests on pypy and pypy 3\n- Prepared to run coverage tests and integrate with `Coveralls <https://coveralls.io>`_\n- Prepared to run tests for the `Sphinx`_ documentation\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nDocumentation sources are included with the project, and used to generate the\ndocumentation sites:\n\n- The `latest docs`_ are always generated for the latest release, kept in the 'master' branch\n- The `development docs`_ are generated from the latest code in the 'develop' branch\n\nYou can also create the documentation from the source files, kept in the 'docs'\nfolder, with the help of `Sphinx`_. For this use the makefile, or the make.bat\nfile, contained on that folder.\n\nPrerequisites\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe project has been tested in the following versions of the interpreter:\n\n- Python 3.4\n- Python 3.5\n- Python 3.6\n- Pypy 3\n\nAll other dependencies are indicated on the requirements.txt file.\n\nThese can be installed with:\n\n``$ pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt``\n\nInstalling\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe project is offered as a `Pypi package`_, and using pip is the preferred way\nto install it. For this use the following command;\n\n``$ pip install bernardomg.version-extractor``\n\nIf needed, manual installation is possible:\n\n``$ python setup.py install``\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe application has been coded in Python, and does not require any particular\nframework.\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nThe tests included with the project can be run with:\n\n``$ python setup.py test``\n\nThis will delegate the execution to tox.\n\nIt is possible to run just one of the test profiles, in this case the py36 profile:\n\n``$ python setup.py test -p \"py36\"``\n\nCollaborate\n-----------\n\nAny kind of help with the project will be well received, and there are two main ways to give such help:\n\n- Reporting errors and asking for extensions through the issues management\n- or forking the repository and extending the project\n\nIssues management\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIssues are managed at the GitHub `project issues tracker`_, where any Github\nuser may report bugs or ask for new features.\n\nGetting the code\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you wish to fork or modify the code, visit the `GitHub project page`_, where\nthe latest versions are always kept. Check the 'master' branch for the latest\nrelease, and the 'develop' for the current, and stable, development version.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThe project has been released under the `MIT License`_.\n\n.. _GitHub project page: https://github.com/Bernardo-MG/python-version-extractor\n.. _latest docs: http://docs.bernardomg.com/bernardomg.version-extractor\n.. _development docs: http://docs.bernardomg.com/development/bernardomg.version-extractor\n.. _Pypi package: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bernardomg.version-extractor\n.. _MIT License: http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php\n.. _project issues tracker: https://github.com/Bernardo-MG/python-version-extractor/issues\n.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org/",
