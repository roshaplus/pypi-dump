    "description": "A project which you can use as template for writing your own Lino\napplication.\n\nBasic use is as follows:\n\n- Find a short one-word name for your application, for example \"Lino\n  Example\".\n\n- Fork this repository (to a repository owned by you and named\n  example) and then clone your fork to get a local working copy.  \n\n- In your working copy:\n\n  - Rename all files and directories containing \"algus\" in their name\n    to \"example\"::\n\n       $ git mv lino_algus lino_example\n       $ git mv lino_algus/lib/algus lino_example/lib/example\n       $ ...\n\n- In all your files (`.py`, `.rst`, `.html`), replace all occurences\n  of \"algus\" by \"example\" (and \"Algus\" by \"Example\").\n\nNote: \"algus\" is the Estonian word for \"start\". We did not name this\ntemplate \"Lino Start\" because the word \"start\" is more likely to occur\nin variable names or text which is not related to the projet name.\n\nTODO: write more.",
