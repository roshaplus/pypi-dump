Download repository as zip.\n2. Unpack zip into folder.\n3. Enter folder.\n4. Run the following command: ::\n\n        $ pip install .\n\n-----\nUsage\n-----\n+++++++++++++++\nInput - Console\n+++++++++++++++\nTo use the application provide a path to the image that the application should extract colors from.\nIn the following example the image is in the folder we are executing the command and the name of the image is ``gameboy.png``:\n\n::\n\n    $ extcolors gameboy.png\n\nIn this example ``gameboy.png`` refers to the following `image <https://dribbble.com/shots/1056595-Gameboy-Free-PSD>`_\ncreated by `Rebecca Machamer <https://dribbble.com/rebeccamachamer>`_.\n\n.. image:: http://cairns.se/extcolors/gameboy.png\n\n++++++++++++++\nInput - Script\n++++++++++++++\nTo use the application provide a path to the image that the application should extract colors from.\nIn the following example the image is in the folder we are executing the command and the name of the image is ``gameboy.png``:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> import extcolors\n    >>> colors, pixel_count = extcolors.extract(\"gameboy.png\")\n    >>> print(colors)\n    [((0, 172, 170), 386062), ((245, 245, 245), 59559), ((82, 90, 92), 17824), ((102, 184, 52), 15080), ((236, 27, 111), 1302), ((255, 180, 0), 137), ((241, 148, 185), 36)]\n\n+++++++++++++\nOutput - Text\n+++++++++++++\nWhen the application is done it will output information about the execution.\nProbably the most relevant information is the ``[RESULT]``-section that contains the extracted colors\nin RGB values and their occurrence rate presented in percentages.\n\nOutput based on ``gameboy.png``: ::\n\n    Extracted colors:\n    (0, 172, 170)  :  80.43% (386062)\n    (245, 245, 245):  12.41% (59559)\n    (82, 90, 92)   :   3.71% (17824)\n    (102, 184, 52) :   3.14% (15080)\n    (236, 27, 111) :   0.27% (1302)\n    (255, 180, 0)  :   0.03% (137)\n    (241, 148, 185):   0.01% (36)\n\n    Pixels in output: 480000 of 480000\n\n++++++++++++++\nOutput - Image\n++++++++++++++\nWhen the application is done it will also create an image in the directory where the command was executed.\nThe image will contain the colors that where extracted sorted based on their occurrence rate, wrapping from  from left to right.\nThe image will use the name of the original image appended with a time stamp of when the execution took place.\n\nOutput based on ``gameboy.png``:\n\n.. image:: http://cairns.se/extcolors/gameboy-result-default.png\n\n\n------------------\nAdditional Options\n------------------\nGenerated output from the command-line argument ``extcolors --help``.\n\n::\n\n    usage: extcolors [-h] [--version] [-t [N]] [-l [N]] PATH\n\n    Extract colors from a specified image. Colors are grouped based on visual\n    similarities using the CIE76 formula.\n\n    positional arguments:\n      PATH\n\n    optional arguments:\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n      --version             show program's version number and exit\n      -t [N], --tolerance [N]\n                            group colors to limit the output and give a better\n                            visual representation. Based on a scale from 0 to 100.\n                            Where 0 won't group any color and 100 will group all\n                            colors into one.

However with a tolerance level of zero it will take ten seconds.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAdobe RGB Color Space Not Supported\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCurrently only the sRGB color space is supported when converting to CIE L*a*b*.\nWhich means that grouped colors might not visual match as one would expect.",
