    "description": "\nAutocrypt command line and library Python code\n==============================================\n\n**this tool is under heavy development, use at your own risk**\n\nThe Python Autocrypt implementation offers a command line\ntool and API.  This README is intended to help contributors\nto get setup with running tests and using the code and\n\"autocrypt\" command line.  There also are online docs at\nhttps://py-autocrypt.readthedocs.io which contain more\ndocumentation.\n\ntesting\n+++++++\n\nTo use the code and run tests you need to have installed:\n\n- the command line client \"gpg\", optionally \"gpg2\",\n  available through \"gnupg\" and \"gnugp2\" on debian.\n\n- something to speed up gpg key creation, e.g.\n  by installing \"rng-tools\" on debian.\n\n- python2.7 and python3.5 if you can.\n  If python3.5 is not present tests for it\n  will be skipped.\n\n- tox either installed via \"pip install tox\"\n  or via the \"python-tox\" debian package.\n\nIf this is all there simply issue:\n\n    tox\n\nto run all the tests against the autocrypt classes\nand the command line.\n\n\ninstallation\n++++++++++++\n\nYou'll need the command line client \"gpg\", optionally \"gpg2\",\navailable through \"gnupg\" and \"gnugp2\" on debian.\n\nTo install the autocrypt command line tool you can install\nthe \"autocrypt\" python package into your virtual environment\nof choice.  If you don't know about python's virtual environments\nyou may just install the debian package \"python-pip\" and then\nuse \"pip\" to install the autocrypt library and command line too::\n\n    $ sudo pip install autocrypt\n\nThis will install the required dependency \"click\", a python\nframework for writing command line clients.\n\n\ninstallation for development\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nIf you plan to work/modify the sources and have\na github checkout we strongly recommend to create\nand activate a python virtualenv and then once use\n**pip without sudo in edit mode**::\n\n    $ virtualenv venv\n    $ source venv/bin/activate\n    $ pip install -e .\n\nChanges you subsequently make to the sources will be\navailable without further installing the autocrypt\npackage again.\n\n\nrunning the command line\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nAfter _installation simply run the main command::\n\n    autocrypt\n\nto see available sub commands and options.  Start by\ninitializing an Autocrypt account which will maintain\nits own keyring and not interfere with your possibly\nexisting gpg default keyring::\n\n    $ autocrypt init\n\nAfterwards you can create an autocrypt header\nfor an email address::\n\n    $ autocrypt make-header x@example.org\n\nYou can process and integrate peer's Autocrypt\nkeys by specifying an email message filename::\n\n    $ autocrypt process-incoming EMAIL_MESSAGE_FILE\n\nAt any point you can show the status of your autocrypt\naccount::\n\n    $ autocrypt show\n",
