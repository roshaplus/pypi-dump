As the quantity by\ndefault is 0 for each line, you have to write the received quantity on 49\nlines.\n\nIn this module we have added a button that helps users to fill automatically\nthe scheduled quantities. Then, the user can just change back \nthe quantities for the product that hasn't been received yet.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nAfter confirming the picking, click on `Auto fill operations` button. The Operations\nmatching the following conditions will be filled automatically:\n\n* The product has no tracking set (Technically `tracking` field should be equal to `none`).\n\n* The operation has not be processed (i.e `qty_done == 0`).\n\n* The operation has no package set (i.e `package_id` is empty).  \n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/154/11.0\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow/issues>`_.
