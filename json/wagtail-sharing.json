It allows you to define an alternate hostname and/or port on which to expose the latest revision of all of your Wagtail pages.\n\nFor example, let's say your Wagtail site is running on http://mysite.com. You've created a draft page at slug ``/path/to/draft``, but haven't yet published it. Wagtail Sharing lets you expose that draft page at some other domain, for example http://sharing.mysite.com/path/to/draft.\n\nIn another use case, you might have a published page at http://mysite.com/already/published/page, and you've made some draft changes. Wagtail Sharing lets you expose those draft changes at http://sharing.mysite.com/already/published/page while still keeping the same published content at your regular domain.\n\nThese examples obviously work best when you have some method of restricting access to http://sharing.mysite.com, for example by only exposing that subdomain on a private network.\n\nWagtail Sharing lets you create separate sharing sites for each Wagtail Site you have defined. It also supports a configurable visual banner on shared pages to remind reviewers that content may differ from your published site.\n\nThis new logic only applies to ``GET`` requests. Other HTTP methods like ``POST`` defer to standard Wagtail handling.\n\nSetup\n-----\n\nInstall the package using pip:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  $ pip install wagtail-sharing\n \nAdd ``wagtailsharing`` as an installed app in your Django settings:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n  # in settings.py\n  INSTALLED_APPS = (\n      ...\n      'wagtailsharing',\n      ...\n  )\n\nRun migrations to create required database tables:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  $ manage.py migrate wagtailsharing\n \nReplace use of Wagtail's catch-all URL pattern:\n\n.. code-block:: diff\n\n  # in urls.py\n  -from wagtail.wagtailcore import urls as wagtail_urls\n  +from wagtailsharing import urls as wagtailsharing_urls\n\n  ...\n\n  -urlpatterns.append(url(r'', include(wagtail_urls)))\n  +urlpatterns.append(url(r'', include(wagtailsharing_urls)))\n\nSharing sites\n-------------\n\nThe Wagtail admin now contains a new section under Settings called Sharing Sites that allows users to define how they would like to expose latest page revisions. \n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cfpb/wagtail-sharing/master/docs/images/sharing-sites.png\n    :width: 200px\n    :height: 100px\n    :alt: Sharing sites\n\nNo sharing sites exist by default. A sharing site must be manually created for each Wagtail Site to make its latest revisions shareable. Each sharing site is defined by a unique hostname and port number. **Important: configuring your sharing sites improperly could expose draft/private content publicly. Be careful when setting them up!**\n\nBanners\n-------\n\nPages viewed on a wagtail-sharing shared site have a simple banner added to them to remind reviewers that the current published content may differ from the content they are viewing.\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cfpb/wagtail-sharing/master/docs/images/banner.png\n    :alt: Banner\n\nThis behavior can be disabled by setting ``settings.WAGTAILSHARING_BANNER = False``.  The banner template can be overridden by providing an alternate template file at ``wagtailsharing/banner.html`` similar to how `wagtailadmin template overrides <http://docs.wagtail.io/en/latest/advanced_topics/customisation/admin_templates.html#customising-admin-templates>`_ are supported.\n\nSharing links\n-------------\n\nA page's sharing URL can be retrieved by passing its ``Page`` instance to ``wagtailsharing.helpers.get_sharing_url``. This method returns ``None`` if no shared sites are configured or if the specified page is not routable to a shared site.\n\nShared pages will also have a new dropdown menu option that links to this sharing URL from the Wagtail page explorer.\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cfpb/wagtail-sharing/master/docs/images/dropdown.png\n    :alt: Dropdown with sharing link\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\n\nThis project has been tested for compatibility with:\n\n* Python 2.7, 3.5\n* Django 1.8, 1.9, 1.10\n* Wagtail 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9\n\nOpen source licensing info\n--------------------------\n\n#. `TERMS <https://github.com/cfpb/cfgov-refresh/blob/master/TERMS.md>`_\n#. `LICENSE <https://github.com/cfpb/cfgov-refresh/blob/master/LICENSE>`_\n#. `CFPB Source Code Policy <https://github.com/cfpb/source-code-policy>`_\n",
