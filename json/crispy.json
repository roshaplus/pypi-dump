    "description": "Crispy is a modern graphical user interface to simulate core-level spectra using the semi-empirical multiplet approaches implemented in `Quanty <http://quanty.org>`_. The interface provides a set of tools to generate input files, submit calculations, and plot the resulting spectra.\n\n.. first-marker\n\n\n.. second-marker\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nWindows and macOS\n-----------------\nThe easiest way to install Crispy is to use the installers provided on the project `downloads <http://www.esrf.eu/computing/scientific/crispy/downloads.html>`_ page. The installers bundle Python, the required dependencies, and Crispy. However, because for the moment they are only created when a new release is published, they might lack newly implemented features. If you want to use the latest development version, follow the instructions on how to install from source.\n\nAll Operating Systems\n---------------------\n\nUsing pip\n*********\nIf you already have Python and all dependencies installed, you can install Crispy using ``pip``::\n\n$ pip install crispy\n\nJust as in the case of using the package installers, this will install the latest release, and not the development version.\n\nFrom Source\n***********\nFirst you have to make sure you have a working Python distribution. If this is not the case, you will need to install it. While Crispy works with both Python 2 and Python 3, you should install Python 3.5 or greater, as in previous versions some of the dependencies like PyQt5 cannot be easily installed using ``pip``. On macOS and Windows you can install Python using the `official <https://www.python.org/downloads>`_ installers. In particular for Windows you should install the 64-bit version of Python, and make sure that during the installation you select to add Python to system's ``PATH``. On Linux, Python and dependencies (see below) can be installed using the system's package manager (``apt-get``, ``dnf``, ``pacman``, etc.).\n\nCrispy depends on the following Python packages:\n\n* `PyQt5 <https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro>`_\n* `numpy <http://numpy.org>`_\n* `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`_\n* `silx <http://www.silx.org>`_\n\nThe dependencies can be installed using ``pip`` (only for Python 3.5 or greater)::\n\n    $ pip install -r requirements.txt [--user]\n\nThe ``--user`` option is usually only required for Linux or macOS operating systems.\n\nIt is possible, although unlikely, that the development version of Crispy requires features that are not yet available with the ``pip`` installable version of silx. In this case you have to also install silx from source. This is not always a very simple task, especially on Windows, but there is extensive `documentation <http://www.silx.org/doc/silx/latest>`_ on how to do it.\n\nOnce Python and all dependencies are installed, you can proceed to installing Crispy. You can download the source code from GitHub either as an `archive <https://github.com/mretegan/crispy/archive/master.zip>`_ or using ``git``::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/mretegan/crispy.git\n\nTo build and install the package, run::\n\n    $ cd crispy\n    $ pip install . [--user]\n\n**Note**: When installing from source, external programs needed to run the calculations have to be installed and their path must be set in the interface (preferred way) or using the ``PATH`` environment variable.\n\n.. third-marker\n\nUsage\n=====\nIf you have used the installers, Crispy should be easy to find and launch. For the installation using ``pip`` and from source you can start Crispy from the command prompt using::\n\n    $ crispy\n\nThis is a file created during the installation and should be available from the command line if the ``PATH`` environment variable was set correctly during the initial Python installation.\n\nYou can also start Crispy without installing it by going to the source directory and executing (only for Python 3)::\n\n    $ python -m crispy\n\n.. forth-marker\n\nCitation\n========\nCrispy is a scientific software.
