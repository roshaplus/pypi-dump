    "description": "pyCLiFF, the Python Command Line Filter Framework is a simple tool designed\nto remove the boilerplate and annoyances from command line filters.\n\nIn *nix there is a tradition of using pipes to connact many programs together\nwhen processing data. The programs are usually very single transformations on\ntext.  This text may come in from a file or from stdin, and leave via file or\nstdout. This pattern is ubiquitous in *nix programming, allowing for very\npowerful command line usage.   Such tools frequently (mostly?) follow the this\npattern:\n\n1. Setup/handle arguments\n2. Mainloop:\n  A. Read line from input file (stdin or file)\n  B. Process that line in some way\n  C. Output the result of processing.\n3. Cleanup and exit.\n\nThe above pattern results in many programs with a large portion of boilerplate\ncode, and a few dozen lines of unique application code. pyCLiFF is an attempt\nto cover all the parts of a command line filter that are not unique. (Usually\nthis means step B above).",
