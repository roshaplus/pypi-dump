    "description": "==========\n Karma Pi\n==========\n\nTime for an update, things moving along.\n\nBits slowly evolving as time passes by.\n\nFinding the core, 3.6, idle, async await.\n\nData and plotting and models to fit.\n\nForecasts to make, but how to share?\n\nThis is a place to share my ideas.\n\nForks are welcome, don't be afraid.\n\nCheck the commit log, what catches your eye?\n\nClick on the delta, see what changed?\n\nWhat was I doing and why might it matter?\n\nA checksum from git, to log a commit.\n\nA seed from a chain to see if it runs.\n\nAnd a checksum with zeroes to see if its right.\n\nCollect the statistics a map reduce.\n\nAnd check the statistics with the same zero sum.\n\nRewarding the miners with information.\n\nCombining the skill of the players.\n\nWith their shared observations in time.\n \nA commit with a future, when will its time be?\n\nKarma pi -- tools to help people of all ages to explore our world.\n\nWorking with python, pi and jupyter.\n\nOn earth and beyond, to look to the future.\n\nOut will come what we put in, with feedback learning and value therein.\n\n\nGet out what you put in\n=======================\n\nCooperative and collaborative multi tasking are a core idea.  If we\nknow all processes running on the network are good actors, then we can\nmake very much better use of the available compute resources.\n\nFurther, this will also ease the flow of information across processes.\n\nKeep it small\n=============\n\nKarma pi tries to turn problems into things that others have already\nsolved.  *pandas*, *matplotlib*, *jupyuter*, *scipy* and *numpy*\nprovide most of what is needed.\n\nPython3.5 provides significant new features that make writing of\ncooperative multi-tasking code very much easier.  *curio* simplifies\nthe use further, making it very easy to write high performance\ndynamic applications.\n\nPig Farm and Currie\n===================\n\nPig, piglet and joy are attempts at providing a simple graphical user\ninterface to plots from matplotlib.  It also supports the tkinter\nCanvas and a number of other widgets.\n\n*currie* uses these libraries to manage a collection of these widgets\n (or *piglets*).  Each widget is a single window, a single window is shown at once.\n\nPiglets have *start()* and *run()* co-routines. *start* is *await*'ed\nwhen the piglet is constructed, *run() is awaited each time the piglet\nbecomes the active one and canceled when the user switches to another\npiglet.\n\nPress 'h' for help on which keyboard presses do what.\n\nPig Farm started life as part of currie, but now has a life of its\nown.\n\nIt has a PigFarm where you can run piglets.  Piglets are just windows\ndisplaying something.\n\nThere are also *micks*.  These are time stamped streams of data, that\npiglets can display, using artists.\n\n\nHush\n====\n\n*hush* turns signal into noise.\n\nFor now, it uses *pyaudio* to read data from any microphones connected to the device.\n\nHow Karma Pi  got its name\n==========================\n\nThe project started as a place to store and serve csv data (also in JSON\nformat) for physical readings.\n\nThese readings might come from anything from a raspberry pi sense hat,\na satellite orbitting the earth, or logs kept by astronomers over the\ncenturies.\n\nCSV - Comma Separated Values\n\nCVS - Concurrent Version System, jumbled CSV.\n\nPharmacy - front end to CVS, CVS is a US pharmacy.\n\nCarma Phy - Jumbled pharmacy.\n\nKarma Phy - Looks better spelt with a K\n\nKarma Pi - Phy for physics, pi for math.\n\nInstall\n=======\n\nUsing pip::\n\n   pip install karmapi\n\nFrom source (eg git repository)::\n\n   pip install ,\n\n\nTo install in development mode,   Navigate to the karmapi folder, then run::\n\n  pip install -e .\n\nThe *-e* flag just says *install in editable mode*.\n\npython and pip\n==============\n\nThe current (0.6x) release requires python3.6.\n\nYou may need to run *pip3.6*  to get the *pip* that goes with your python3.6.\n\nUbuntu on Pi\n============\n\nSo far have not got this working.  Sticking with raspbian for now.\n\nhttp://releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-core/16/ubuntu-core-16-pi3.img.xz\n\n# Note: replace /dev/sdX with the device name of your SD card (e.g. /dev/mmcblk0, /dev/sdg1 ...)\n\nxzcat ~/Downloads/ubuntu-core-16-pi3.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=32M\nsync\n\n\nLearning python\n===============\n\nThe python 3 tutorial is a great place to start:\n\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/\n\nPick a section that interests you.\n\n\n\ncurio\n=====\n\nAsynchronous magic library.\n\n\njupyter\n=======\n\nInspiration, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy and more.\n\n\nmatplotlib\n==========\n\nPlotting wonder.\n\npandas\n======\n\nData frames, time series, statistics.\n\n\ntkinter\n=======\n\nSimple, fast widgets\n\nCKAN\n====\n\nOpen data repositories.\n\nFIXME\n=====\n\nNeed to do a release with a sane set of requirements,   GETTING THERE\n\nWant something that installs on a pi reasonably quickly,   GETTING THERE\n\n[Assume pi already has python3.6]\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nThis README is the most current at the moment.\n\nMost code modules have some commentary at the top.\n\nThe git commit log is a good place to browse.  Commit messages are\nbrief, follow one that interests you.\n\nThere are *rst* files in the *docs* folder and a *conf.py* for *sphinx*::\n\n  pip install sphinx\n\n(pip3.6 if you have multiple pythons).\n\nAfter that just run:\n\n   make html\n\nThis should build html docs in the folder *_build/html*.\n\nThese can be served with python3::\n\n    python -m http.server\n\nThis is not a secure server, but great for testing and on a trusted\nnetwork.\n\nsphinx-autodoc\n--------------\n\nIt would be good to get this working to see what the docs extracted\nfrom the code look like.\n\nReadthedocs\n-----------\n\nThis might already be working.  FIXME check,\n\nDocs need a fair bit of work, but better docstrings in the code turn into pretty good docs.\n\nRelease\n=======\n\nA release is overdue.  The next one will require python3.6.\n\nFor now, probably best to install from source code,\n\nMaking a new release\n--------------------\n\nInstall some stuff needed to help with building releases::\n\n   pip3.6 install twine wheel\n\nBuild a source releas (this just creates a tarball in the dists/ subfolder)::\n\n   python setup.py sdist\n\nBuild a binary release::\n\n   python setup.py bdist\n\nUpload to PyPi with twine (you will need a username and password that\nhas access to the project you are trying to update)::\n\n   twine upload dist/*\n\nDevelop\n=======\n\ngit clone https://github.com/openbermuda/karmapi\n\ncd karmapi\n\npip3.6 -e .\n\nPython3.6 on Ubuntu 16.04 and raspbian\n======================================\n\n    git clone https://github.com/python/cpython\n\ncheckout v3.6.1 tag, then:\n\n    ./configure\n    make\n    make install\n\nNote: python3.6 can be installed (from universe) with apt on Ubuntu >=\n16.10.\n\nThings to do first\n------------------\n\nSome dev libraries need installing into Ubuntu for certain features to be built into the python.\n\ntkinter is one part you need to make sure *tk-8.6-dev* is installed before ./configure.\n\nThe good news is that after the intitial build it all runs pretty fast.\n\n* tk-8.6-dev -- for tkinter\n\n* libbz2-dev -- compression library\n\n* libssl-dev -- for ssl support required for pip3.6 to work.\n\nTODO\n====  \n\nEric IDLE.  Take a closer look at event handling.  Unify with pigfarm\nevent handling.\n\nBe smarter about opening files with eric.  Add --file option to\ncommand line tools?\n\nMagicCarpet v Canvas: are they the same thing?\n\nSense Hat:  record and display data.   \n\nHush: use rate to figure out time when reading.  Adjust rate so we can\nkeep up?\n\nEigen-vectors: more on principal components.\n\nSync movement of sonogram with beat\n\nShare micks with others.\n\nShare yossers with others,",
