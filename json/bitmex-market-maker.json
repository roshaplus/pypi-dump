    "description": "BitMEX Market Maker\n===================\n\nThis is a sample market making bot for use with [BitMEX](https://www.bitmex.com).\n\nIt is free to use and modify for your own strategies. It provides the following:\n\n* A `BitMEX` object wrapping the REST and WebSocket APIs.\n  * All data is realtime and efficiently [fetched via the WebSocket](market_maker/ws/ws_thread.py). This is the fastest way to get market data.\n  * Orders may be created, queried, and cancelled via `BitMEX.buy()`, `BitMEX.sell()`, `BitMEX.open_orders()` and the like.\n  * Withdrawals may be requested (but they still must be confirmed via email and 2FA).\n  * Connection errors and WebSocket reconnection is handled for you.\n  * [Permanent API Key](https://testnet.bitmex.com/app/apiKeys) support is included.\n* A scaffolding for building your own trading strategies.\n  * Out of the box, a simple market making strategy is implemented that blankets the bid and ask.\n  * More complicated strategies are up to the user. Try incorporating [index data](https://testnet.bitmex.com/app/index/.XBT),\n    query other markets to catch moves early, or develop your own completely custom strategy.\n\n**Develop on [Testnet](https://testnet.bitmex.com) first!** Testnet trading is completely free and is identical to the live market.\n\n> BitMEX is not responsible for any losses incurred when using this code. This code is intended for sample purposes ONLY - do not\n  use this code for real trades unless you fully understand what it does and what its caveats are.\n\n> This is not a sophisticated market making program. It is intended to show the basics of market making while abstracting some\n  of the rote work of interacting with the BitMEX API. It does not make smart decisions and will likely lose money.\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\n1. Create a [Testnet BitMEX Account](https://testnet.bitmex.com) and [deposit some TBTC](https://testnet.bitmex.com/app/deposit).\n2. Install: `pip install bitmex-market-maker`\n3. Create a marketmaker project: run `marketmaker setup`\n    * This will create `settings.py` and `market_maker/` in the working directory.\n    * Modify `settings.py` to tune parameters.\n4. Edit settings.py to add your [BitMEX API Key and Secret](https://testnet.bitmex.com/app/apiKeys) and change bot parameters.\n    * Note that user/password authentication is not supported.\n    * Run with DRY_RUN=True to test cost and spread.\n5. Run it: `marketmaker [symbol]`\n6. Satisfied with your bot's performance? Create a [live API Key](https://www.bitmex.com/app/apiKeys) for your\n   BitMEX account, set the `BASE_URL` and start trading!\n\nOperation Overview\n------------------\n\nThis market maker works on the following principles:\n\n* The MM tracks the last `bidPrice` and `askPrice` of the quoted instrument to determine where to start quoting.\n* Based on parameters set the user, the bot creates a descriptions of orders it would like to place.\n  - If `settings.MAINTAIN_SPREADS` is set, the bot will start inside the current spread and work outwards.\n  - Otherwise, spread is determined by interval calculations.\n* If the user specified position limits, these are checked. If the current position is beyond a limit,\n  the bot stops quoting that side of the market.\n* These order descriptors are compared with what the bot has currently placed in the market.\n  - If an existing order can be amended to the desired value, it is amended.\n  - Otherwise, a new order is created.\n  - Extra orders are canceled.\n* The bot then prints details of contracts traded, tickers, and total delta.\n\nSimplified Output\n-----------------\n\nThe following is some of what you can expect when running this bot:\n\n```\n2016-01-28 17:29:31,054 - INFO - market_maker - BitMEX Market Maker Version: 1.0\n2016-01-28 17:29:31,074 - INFO - ws_thread - Connecting to wss://testnet.bitmex.com/realtime?subscribe=quote:XBT7D,trade:XBT7D,instrument,order:XBT7D,execution:XBT7D,margin,position\n2016-01-28 17:29:31,074 - INFO - ws_thread - Authenticating with API Key.\n2016-01-28 17:29:31,075 - INFO - ws_thread - Started thread\n2016-01-28 17:29:32,079 - INFO - ws_thread - Connected to WS.

For example, placing 16 orders consumes\n  2 requests.\n* Bulk order cancel: Consumes 1 request no matter the size. Is not blocked by an exceeded ratelimit; cancels will\n  always succeed. This bot will always cancel all orders on an error or interrupt.\n\nIf you are quoting multiple contracts and your ratelimit is becoming an obstacle, please\n[email support](mailto:support@bitmex.com) with details of your quoting. In the vast majority of cases,\nwe are able to raise a user's ratelimit without issue.\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\n\nCommon errors we've seen:\n\n* `TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'json'`\n  * This is caused by an outdated version of `requests`. Run `pip install -U requests` to update.\n\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\n\nThis module supports Python 3.5 and later.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\nBitMEX has a Python [REST client](https://github.com/BitMEX/api-connectors/tree/master/official-http/python-swaggerpy)\nand [websocket client.](https://github.com/BitMEX/api-connectors/tree/master/official-ws/python)",
