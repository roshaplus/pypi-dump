    "description": "A cli TagSpaces_ client, especially geared towards `The Secret Weapon`_\napproach to Getting Things Done.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nA few months into 2017 I read Jon Westenberg's post about how `he uses\nEvernote`_ to keep track of all the things that he needs to do. In the article\nhe has some pretty golden advice:\n\n::\n\n    Before I get into it though, I want to be clear. What I do might not work\n    for you. There is no golden key to productivity, and this is pretty\n    specifically designed to match my workflow and my personality.\n\nWhich is, of course, fantastic advice.\n\nWhile I'm sure Evernote is a fantastic tool with all the bells and whistles\nthat one could desire, it's not exactly *my* bells and whistles. I have a\nslightly different approach that I prefer. I'm much more into the command line,\nmainly because it's the easiest way to eliminate distractions. Yeah, you can\nturn off distractions in your browser and on your phone - but you actually have\nto turn *on* distractions on the command line. So I try to spend most of my\ntime here.\n\nAbout a year ago I also came across TagSpaces_, which has a philosophy I love:\njust stick the information into the filename itself. Then it doesn't matter\nwhat system you're using, the information is going to travel with the file.\n\nAfter I read Jon's article, I started trying to use the TagSpaces client. It\nworked well enough, though it wasn't quite as keyboard-centric as I wanted.\nUsing Dropbox to sync my files worked great (though they still don't have a\nclient for the Raspberry Pi, grumble grumble).\n\nI toyed around with using the command line, ``ls *1-now*`` or ``find . -name\n*3-soon*`` worked pretty well, but it was still a bit clunky. Out of that need\ncame Shibboleth\n\nGuide\n-----\n\nShibboleth is pretty simple. At the moment it only supports Linux-y systems\n(there's some weirdness on Mac OSX, with readline), but I'm always open to\n`pull requests`_!\n\nAll you have to do is install shibboleth:\n\n::\n\n    python3.6 -m pip install shibboleth\n\n(Come join me in the glorious future that is Python3.6! Or, if you think it's\nawesome and you live in some horrible reality that requires something ancient,\nI'm totally accepting `pull requests`_)\n\nOnce it's installed, just start it up in whatever directory you want to stick\nyour stuff. Maybe you do something like this:\n\n::\n\n    $ cd ~/Dropbox/\n    $ mkdir secret-weapon\n    $ cd secret-weapon\n    $ mkdir completed\n    $ shibboleth\n    Welcome to Shibboleth, the tool designed to be *your* secret weapon.\n\n    Your editor is currently vim. If you don't like that, you\n    should change or set your EDITOR environment variable.\n\n    \u21c0shibboleth:/home/wayne/Dropbox/secret-weapon\n    > new\n    Title: Try out shibboleth\n\nThat will launch your editor - whatever your ``EDITOR`` environment variable is\nset to. Or ``vim``, if nothing is set. ``:q`` is how you get out of Vim, if\nthat's not your thing.\n\nSave and quit and you should come back to shibboleth:\n\n::\n\n    \u21c0shibboleth:/tmp/fnord/Try-out-shibboleth[20170406~011315].md\n    >show\n    ********************************************************************************\n    Trying out shibboleth, how does it work for me?\n\n    ********************************************************************************\n    \u21c0shibboleth:/tmp/fnord/Try-out-shibboleth[20170406~011315].md\n    >\n\nIt will automatically select the new file. You may notice that it changed the\nspaces for ``-``. That's because readline is confusing and hard and doesn't\nlike autocompleteing spaces. But if you can make it do the right thing, did I\nmention I'm accepting `pull requests`_?\n\nSo you can change the priority of your selected file/task with ``priority``, or\nthe shortcut ``p``.\n\n::\n\n    >p 1\n    \u21c0shibboleth:/tmp/fnord/Try-out-shibboleth[20170406~011315 1-now].md\n    >\n\nYou can ``deselect`` to drop that, or ``select`` a different file. Or create\nanother ``new`` one:\n\n::\n\n    >new something completely different\n    \u21c0shibboleth:/tmp/fnord/something-completely-different[20170406~013345].md\n    >show\n    ********************************************************************************\n    A man with three legs!\n\n    > 'e ran off!\n\n    ********************************************************************************\n    \u21c0shibboleth:/tmp/fnord/something-completely-different[20170406~013345].md\n    p 4\n    \u21c0shibboleth:/tmp/fnord/something-completely-different[20170406~013345 4-later].md\n    >\n\nYou can use ``ls`` to list all the files in the directory, ``cd`` to change\ndirectory. Or if you just want to see what you're supposed to be doing now:\n\n::\n\n    > now\n    trying-out-shibboleth[20170406~013326 1-now].md\n    \u21c0shibboleth:/tmp/fnord/trying-out-shibboleth[20170406~013326 1-now].md\n    >later\n    something-completely-different[20170406~013345 4-later].md\n    \u21c0shibboleth:/tmp/fnord/trying-out-shibboleth[20170406~013326 1-now].md\n    >\n\nOnce you're done with a thing, you can ``compelete`` it, or be ``done`` with\nit:\n\n::\n\n    >done\n    \u21c0shibboleth:/tmp/fnord\n    >cd completed\n    \u21c0shibboleth:/tmp/fnord/completed\n    >later\n    something-completely-different[20170406~013345 4-later].md\n\nThat's really about all there is to it. The way I use this is\n\n- start up shibboleth\n- check my ``waiting`` list to see if there's anything I need to move out of\n  waiting.\n- Go through ``someday``, ``later``, ``soon``, and ``next`` to see if anything\n  needs to be bumped up.\n- Decide which of ``now`` I need to work on the most, then ``s`` elect it. I\n  may ``edit`` it to add some notes or just ``show`` to review what I'm\n  supposed to be doing. Then when I finish that I mark it ``done`` and move on\n  to the next.\n\nAs new tasks come in via email, etc. I go ahead and add new ones. I've been\nusing shibboleth as the interface for my tasks for about a day now and it works\n*great* for shifting the priority, creating new tasks, and editing ones that\nI've got.\n\nIf you've got any suggestions about what would make shibboleth (more) awesome,\nI'm happy to work with you to get your `pull request`_ in. Or if I've got some\ntime or I think it's a killer feature, I'm sure I'll add it to my own list.\nUsing shibboleth, of course :)\n\nPhilosophy\n----------\n\nI would prefer to keep this as 3rd-party-dependency-free as possible. I'm not\nopposed to adding some kind of plugin architecture, but I *really* want\nshibboleth to stay one single file. That way you can just stick it in a\ndirectory and you're good to go.\n\nTODOs\n-----\n\n- Add BSD license\n- Add other tag support\n- config. We want to be able to config shibboleth, right? Different colors and\n  what-not.\n\n.. _TagSpaces: https://www.tagspaces.org/\n.. _The Secret Weapon: http://www.thesecretweapon.org/the-secret-weapon-manifesto/manifesto-part-1-the-issue\n.. _he uses Evernote: https://medium.com/hi-my-name-is-jon/how-i-use-evernote-to-pitch-at-the-top-of-my-game-2c5966ef720b\n.. _pull requests: https://github.com/waynew/shibboleth#fork-destination-box\n.. _pull request: https://github.com/waynew/shibboleth#fork-destination-box\n\n\n",
