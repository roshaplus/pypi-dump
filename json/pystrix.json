    "description": "**pystrix** is an attempt at creating a versatile `Asterisk <http://www.asterisk.org/>`_-interface package for AMI and (Fast)AGI needs. It is published as an open-source library under the LGPLv3 by `Ivrnet, inc. <http://www.ivrnet.com/>`_, welcoming contributions from all users.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\n========\r\nOverview\r\n========\r\n\r\npystrix runs on python 2.7/python 3.4+ on any platform. It's targeted at Asterisk 1.10+ and provides a rich, easy-to-extend set of bindings for AGI, FastAGI, and AMI.\r\n\r\n================\r\nRelease Schedule\r\n================\r\n\r\nThe current code in the repository correspond to version **1.1.0** of the package.  When a bug is found and fixed a new version of the package will be generated in order to keep it updated and as bug-free as possible.\r\n\r\nNew releases will follow the format: <release mayor>.<release minor>.<bug fixed> according to the change made to the code.\r\n\r\n=======\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n\r\nAfter some research, we found that what was available was either incompatible with the architecture model we needed to work with `Twisted <http://www.twistedmatrix.org/>`_, (while excellent for a great many things, isn't always the right choice), was targeting an outdated version of Asterisk, or had a very rigid, monolithic design. Identifying the `pyst <http://pyst.sourceforge.net/>`_ and `py-asterisk <http://code.google.com/p/py-asterisk/>`_ packages as being similar, but structurally incompatible, to what we wanted, pyst was chosen as the basis for this project, with a full rewrite of its AGI and AMI systems to provide a uniform-looking, highly modular design that incorporates logic and ideas from py-asterisk. The end result is a package that should satisfy anyone who was looking at either of its ancestors and that should be easier to extend as Asterisk continues to evolve.\r\n\r\n============\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\n* From pip \r\n\r\n.. code:: bash\r\n\r\n    $ pip install pystrix\r\n        \r\n* From github\r\n\r\n.. code:: bash\r\n\r\n    $ pip install -e git://github.com/marsoguti/pystrix.git#egg=pystrix\r\n\r\n=====\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n\r\nDetailed usage information is provided in the documentation, along with simple examples that should help to get anyone started.\r\n\r\n=============\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\n\r\nOnline documentation is available at http://pystrix.readthedocs.io/.\r\n\r\nInline documentation is complete and made readable by `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_, so you'll never be completely lost.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\n=======\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\n\r\n`Ivrnet, inc. <http://www.ivrnet.com/>`_\r\n * Initial development of pystrix was funded by Ivrnet\r\n * Ivrnet is a software-as-a-service company that develops and operates intelligent software applications, delivered through traditional phone networks and over the Internet.
