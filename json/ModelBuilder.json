    "description": "Purpose\r\n\r\nModelBuilder was created to be a generic interface to people that need to\r\nsimulated Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) models and analyze their output.\r\n\r\nFor that purpose I wrote a (hopefully) nice frontend to the LSODA ODE solving\r\nlibrary, so that the model equations can be written directly in the main window\r\nand the parameters for the numerical integration can also be set easily.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\nThe system of ODEs can be solved for the specified number of time steps, from\r\nthe initial values, by pressing the run button.\r\n\r\nSince most user need to assess uncertainties assocciated to to model components\r\n(variables). I added an uncertainty analysis module, which allows for a\r\nstate-of-the-art Bayesian inference on the model components.",
