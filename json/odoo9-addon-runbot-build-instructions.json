When\nchecked:\n\n* Modules to test becomes required attribute.\n* Custom build directory can be specified. This is where the repo will be\n  cloned in the build directory.\n* Custom server path is required to be specified. This is tells runbot which\n  executable script to run.\n* Custom server flags can be specified to add to execution. E.g. --workers=0\n* Pre-build commands can be run such as additional fetch scripts or buildout.\n* An alternate repository can be specified, and then passed on to the custom\n  build commands. A practical example of that is passing on a repository\n  containing a clone of odoo to the custom build script. That script can for\n  example make a local clone of odoo, saving both time and disk space.\n* An option allows to skip the standard test jobs. This is useful if the whole\n  build phase is done in a custom script in the prebuild step.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/146/8.0\n\nFor further information, please visit:\n\n* https://www.odoo.com/forum/help-1\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/{project_repo}/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed feedback\n`here <https://github.com/OCA/runbot-addons/issues/new?body=module:%20runbot_build_instructions%0Aversion:%208.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nContributors\n------------\n* Sandy Carter (sandy.carter@savoirfairelinux.com)\n* Leonardo Pistone (leonardo.pistone@camptocamp.com)\n\nMaintainer\n----------\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nTo contribute to this module, please visit http://odoo-community.org.",
