    "description": "Usage: gdax_recurring [OPTIONS]\n\n  This script automates recurring USD deposits and asset allocation for\n  GDAX.\n\n  When run, it will check whether a deposit needs to be made and, if so,\n  initiate the deposit using a linked bank account.\n\n  Then, if there is enough available USD in the GDAX account, it will buy\n  currencies using all of the available USD, given a user-specified asset\n  allocation. Currencies are traded at market price at the time the script\n  is run.\n\n  This script is meant to be run as a cron. The cron can be run at any\n  interval less than the `deposit-interval` -- I recommend daily.  The\n  script will ensure that deposits are only made every `deposit-interval`\n  irrespective of how often it is run. Do NOT run this script in multiple\n  threads, as it may result in duplicate deposits.\n\n  In addition to the CLI options, a few environment variables must be\n  present:\n\n      GDAX_API_KEY\n      GDAX_API_SECRET\n      GDAX_PASSPHRASE\n\n  Installation:\n\n      pip install gdax_recurring\n\n  Example usage:\n\n      export GDAX_API_KEY=<your_api_key>\n      export GDAX_API_SECRET=<your_api_secret>\n      export GDAX_PASSPHRASE=<your_passphrase>\n      gdax_recurring -d 100.00 -i 15 -m 50.00 -a LTC 0.5 -a ETH 0.25 -a BTC 0.25\n\n  Explanation:\n\n      The above invocation will deposit $100.00 every 15 days. In addition,\n      if the GDAX account has at least $50.00 available to trade, all of the\n      available USD will be used to buy other currencies as follows:\n\n      50% will be used to buy LTC\n      25% will be used to buy ETH\n      25% will be used to buy BTC\n\nOptions:\n  -d, --deposit-amount TEXT       Amount to deposit every `deposit-interval`\n                                  days\n  -i, --deposit-interval INTEGER  Interval in days after which a deposit\n                                  should be made\n  -m, --min-available-to-trade DECIMAL\n                                  The minimum available balance in USD that,\n                                  when met, will result in an allocation\n  -a, --allocation-percentage <TEXT DECIMAL>...\n                                  A currency and the percentage of available\n                                  funds that should be allocated to it. This\n                                  option may be provided multiple times for\n                                  different currencies and the total\n                                  percentage should add up to 1. If the total\n                                  percentage is less than one, the remainder\n                                  will be left as USD.\n\n                                  Example: -a ETH 0.25\n                                  -a BTC 0.25 -a LTC 0.5\n  -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.",
