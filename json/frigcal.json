    "description": "This Python 3.X/tkinter program implements basic personal calendar functionality, in a standalone desktop GUI. Its design aims to emulate refrigerator-style calendars.\r\n\r\nAmong its features are:\r\nportable and standard iCalendar files for event storage; \r\nmultiple calendar files support, and new file creation; \r\nmultiple, resizable, and configurable month windows display; \r\nmonth images display per month view window; \r\nand automatic backup of calendar files, with multiple backups management.\r\n\r\nThis program does not implement some more advanced calendar tools (including automatically recurring and spanning events; see its main page for details).  In exchange, it minimizes both code and GUI complexity; reduces the risk of data loss; and provides an open and portable interface sufficient for most personal calendar needs that requires neither a login nor a subscription.",
