    "description": "## Zoonomia\n\nZoonomia is a library for multi-objective strongly typed genetic programming.\nThe aim is to unify some ideas from various sub-fields of evolutionary\noptimization under a simple yet sufficiently expressive API. At this stage this\nproject is much more an autodidactic exploration of this kind of system than a\n\"stable\",  \"performant\", or \"useful\" artifact. Everything here is subject to\nchange, there are no guarantees.",
