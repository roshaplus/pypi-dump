    "description": "Arrr.py - Pirate Speak for Python\n=================================\n\nA simple script / module to turn plain English into Pirate speak. Arrr.\n\nSomeone mentioned something called \"Pirate Python\", I idly wondered if anyone\nhad made an English to Pirate-ish module/command written in Python (they\nhadn't), I realised I had a burning desire to make one, and things got out of\nhand. :-)\n\nWe have an entirely serious `code of conduct <https://github.com/ntoll/arrr/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.rst>`_\nand a not-so-serious `code of mis-conduct <https://github.com/ntoll/arrr/blob/master/CODE_OF_MISCONDUCT.rst>`_\nfor those of a more Piratical disposition.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install simply type::\n\n    $ pip install arrr\n\n...and the package will download from PyPI. If you wish to upgrade to the\nlatest version, use the following command::\n\n    $ pip install --no-cache --upgrade arrr\n\nCommand Usage\n-------------\n\nOnce installed, you'll find you have a ``pirate`` command to use in your shell.\n\nTo read the (non-Pirate friendly) help, simply type::\n\n    $ pirate --help\n\nor::\n\n    $ pirate -h\n\nTo translate plain English into something Pirate-ish simply call the command\nfollowed by some English sentence::\n\n    $ pirate hello there. how are you today?\n    Ahoy there. Weigh anchor and hoist the mizzen! How are ye today?\n\nThe ``pirate`` command will reply with a Pirate-ish equivalent (as shown\nabove).\n\n.. note::\n\n    **This software misbehaves like a Pirate.**\n\n    Sometimes, the ``pirate`` command will not only translate English to\n    Pirate-ish, but will also interject with Pirate sayings (such as,\n    \"Weigh anchor and hoist the mizzen!\" as shown above).\n\n    This is entirely normal and perfectly Piratical behaviour. What else\n    were you expecting..?\n\nUsing the API\n-------------\n\nThe ``arrr`` module's API is fully documented below. All you really need is to\nimport the ``translate`` function and use that to return Pirate-ish sentences\nfrom a given input in English::\n\n    from arrr import translate\n\n\n    english = \"Hello there. How are you?\"\n    pirate = translate(english)\n    print(pirate)\n\nThe script above will print output similar to that for the command-line usage\nexample shown above.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nThe source code is  `hosted in GitHub <https://github.com/ntoll/arrr>`_. Please\nfeel free to fork the repository and contribute.\nAssuming you have Git installed you can download the code from the canonical\nrepository with the following command::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/ntoll/arrr.git\n\nEnsure you have the correct dependencies for development installed by creating\na virtualenv and running::\n\n    $ pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nPull requests are most welcome! Honestly, the ``arrr`` module was cobbled\ntogether in about 5 minutes and I went overboard (geddit?) with creating a\nsimple yet well packaged and documented project so ``arrr`` can act as a good\nexample for beginner developers.\n\nIf you find any bugs, `submit a new issue <https://github.com/ntoll/arrr/issues/new>`_.\n\n\nRelease History\n===============\n\n1.0.0.beta.3\n============\n\n* Better arrrg parsing contributed by Tony \"buccaneer baloney\" Shaw.\n* Corrections of speeling mistaiks by Esteve \"make mine an Aranjuez\" Fernandez.\n\n1.0.0.beta.2\n============\n\n* Major code optimizations by old salty sea dog Terry Jones.\n* A more terrifying logo by Cap'n Steve \"Inkspot\" Hawkes.\n* Addition of a code of mis-conduct (for Pirates) by terror of the seas, Tim\n  \"No beard\" Golden.\n\n1.0.0.beta.1\n============\n\n* Minor documentation fixes.\n* Minor corrections in the code.\n\n1.0.0.alpha.1\n=============\n\n* Initial release.\n* Very simple implementation.\n* Documentation.\n* No tests.\n",
