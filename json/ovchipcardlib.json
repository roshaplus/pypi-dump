    "description": "=============\novchipcardlib\n=============\n\nA library to interact with the ov-chip card service.\n\nIt utilizes the webapi of the mobile apps to get the information.\nVery loosely based on https://github.com/OVChip/ovchipapi-python for the\nauthentication part.\n\nBe aware that the ov-chip card system used in the Netherlands for public\ntransport was not designed to be real time. So expect a hefty time drift\nbefore the actual checkin/out action and information showing up on the api\nand by extension on the transactions list.\n\nAlso the sequence of transactions is not guaranteed. It is absolutelly\ncertain that if there are a lot of checkins/outs closely together they will\nappear out of order on the web api. Apparently there is a serverside job that\nsorts them once a day.\n\nThe library handles that by sorting the list of transactions always. So on\nany action it would return a properly ordered list of events but in case of\nmonitoring through the card.get_latest_transactions() method it is\nabsolutelly guaranteed that transaction will appear out of order and with a\ndelay ranging between 2 and 15 minutes according to some simple benchmarks.\n\n\n* Documentation: http://ovchipcardlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* Can get cards bound with the account and lists of transactions for the cards.\n\n\n\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n0.1 (14-04-2017)\n---------------------\n\n* First release on pypi",
