Typically if you have\n  connected your Odoo instance to an online store like Shop Invader,\n  Prestashop, Magento, or if you use light Odoo shop (```website_sale```\n  module).\n* Once the order validated, you prepare your pickings\n* The customer come in your shop to recover his order\n* the customer add (or remove) some products\n* the customer pay his order, based on the real delivered products list.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nTo configure this module, you need to:\n\n#. Go to Warehouse / Configuration / Types of Operation\n#. Select the picking type(s) you want to see in the point of sale\n#. Check the box 'Available in Point of Sale'\n\n.. figure:: static/description/stock_picking_type_form.png\n   :width: 800 px\n\nNote: This box is NOT enabled by default except in demo data for the type\n'Delivery Orders' of the demo company 'YourCompany'.\n\n#. Go to Point of Sale / Configuration / Point of Sales\n#. Select the Point(s) of Sales witch those you want to enable the feature\n#. Check the box 'Load Pickings'.\n\n.. figure:: static/description/pos_config_form.png\n   :width: 800 px\n\nNote: This box is enabled by default\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo use this module, you need to:\n\n* Launch the point of sale\n* On a new order (without lines), click on the 'Load Picking' button.\n\n.. figure:: static/description/load_picking_01.png\n   :width: 800 px\n\n* Point of sale will load available pickings. (About displayed pickings, see\n  'Technical Notes' below).\n\n.. figure:: static/description/load_picking_02.png\n   :width: 800 px\n\n* Click on a picking will display the content of the moves (as PoS Order Lines)\n\n.. figure:: static/description/load_picking_03.png\n   :width: 800 px\n\nThe price and the discount will be the sale price and the discount set in\nthe according Sale Order Line, if it was found. Otherwise, discount will be to\n0, and unit price will be the unit price of the product when it has been\nloaded in the Point of Sale.\n\n**Related Sale Order:**\n\n.. figure:: static/description/load_picking_04.png\n   :width: 800 px\n\n**Related Picking:**\n\n.. figure:: static/description/load_picking_05.png\n   :width: 800 px\n\n* Confirm the selection, by clicking on 'Select' button.\n\n* Finally, you can add / remove products or change quantity and collect the\n  payment.\n\nWhen, the order is marked as paid, the original picking will be cancelled,\nbecause Point Of Sale generates a new picking related to the real delivered\nproducts and the original Sale Order will pass to the state 'Done'. (Delivery\nexception is ignored).\n(See 'Technical Notes' below).\n\nSome warning messages can appear:\n\n* if some products are not available in the Point of Sale.\n\n.. figure:: static/description/load_picking_06.png\n   :width: 800 px\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/184/8.0\n\nTechnical Notes\n===============\n\n* By default, the following filters are applied on the pickings displayed:\n    * 'State' should be 'Waiting Availability', 'Partially Available' or\n      'Ready to Transfer'.\n    * 'Invoice Control' should be 'To be invoiced'.\n  You can change this filter by overloading the ```_prepare_filter_for_pos```\n  function of the model ```stock.picking```\n\n* By default, original Picking is cancelled and the Sale order is set to the\n  state 'Done'. You can change this behaviour by overloading\n  ```_handle_orders_with_original_picking``` function of the model\n  ```pos.order```.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* This module will try to get original unit price from the sale order and not\n  use the Current unit price of the product. (The price at which you pledged\n  to sell the product).\n  Some VAT troubles will occure if a product is set with VAT marked as\n  'VAT included' and if in the sale order line, there are some VAT marked as\n  'VAT excluded'. **The VAT settings should be consistent**.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/pos/issues>`_.
