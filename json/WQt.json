    "description": "WQt - A Qt project manager\n==========================\n\nWQt is a Qt project management tool which allows the user to create,\nupdate, build, and run Qt projects from command line. It uses CMake to\nbuild the project, hence making it compatible with almost any text\neditor and IDE.\n\nPrerequisites\n-------------\n\nIn order for this tool to work, the user needs to make sure the\npreequisites discussed below are met.\n\n-  Install ``Qt`` for your machine\n-  Add Qt\u2019s bin folder to the path\n\n   -  This will depend on the compiler you installed through Qt\n      installer\n   -  Ex: ``/usr/doge/applications/Qt/5.10.0/clang_64/bin``\n\n-  Install ``CMake`` for your machine\n-  Install ``Make`` and basic ``C/C++`` tools\n\nProject Structure\n-----------------\n\nWQt tries to define a project structure for the user. This is done to\norganize the Qt code and to make it is easier to build and compile. Any\ncustom structure may break the functionality of the tool and hence\nshould be avoided.\n\n::\n\n    wqt create\n\nThe command above is used to create a project structure. This will\ninitialize the project will add template files to get the user started.\nQt can have multiple type of applications, hence **three** of these\napplications are supported: ``widgets``, ``quick`` and ``console``. The\n``create`` command will take an argument of which Qt application to\ncreate and one of the above can be specified. This will then create a\nproject structure for that particular application. The basic project\nstructure is as follow:\n\n::\n\n    project/\n        lib/\n        src/\n        res/\n        wqt/\n            cmake/\n            helper/\n        .gitignore\n        config.json\n        CMakeLists.txt\n\nConfigurations and Updates\n--------------------------\n\nEvery project needs to have some way of configuring properties and this\nis why there is a ``config.json`` file in every ``WQt`` project. This\nfile is very important because it contains critical information need to\nmake the ``build``, and ``run`` possible. This configuration file is\ndifferent based on which machine the project is created on. Config\nfiles\u2019 templates are:\n\n**Mac OS**\n\n.. figure:: screenshots/config_mac.png\n   :alt: Mac OS config\n\n   config-mac\n\n**Windows and Linux**\n\n.. figure:: screenshots/config_others.png\n   :alt: Mac OS config\n\n   config-mac\n\nLooking at these configuration files, you can see that the fields are\ndefined without user needed to change them. This is done because we\nwanted to have a system where the user ``creates`` the project and then\nit runs ``immediately``. The ``name-project`` field is automatically\nfilled with the name of the project folder. Mac OS needs a bit more\ninformation to create a ``.app`` file and hence extra fields are\nprovided in the configuration file. **Note: These fields can be modified\nand the project will adjust accordingly**\n\nIn order for the new configurations to take affect, ``update`` command\nis used\n\n::\n\n    wqt update\n\nThis command updates the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file and makes necessary\nchanges to the project based on the ``config.json`` properties. This\ncommand is a must run for the new configurations to be accepted. **Note:\nit is useful to run his command after cloning a WQt project repo to have\nit customized according to your machine**\n\nBuilding the project\n--------------------\n\nWQt provides a way to build the project with just one command. All the\nbuild files are stored in the ``wqt/build`` folder. This folder is\nincluded in the ``.gitignore`` by default. After building the project, a\n``bin`` folder is created to store the executable and all the resources\nit needs. This file is also a part of ``.gitignore`` by default. In the\norder to build the project, ``build`` command is used.\n\n::\n\n    wqt build\n\nImportant information\n---------------------\n\nAs you all are reading this, you should know that all these commands\nonly work when you are in the project directory. If you are not in the\nproject directory, ``--path <PATH>`` optional command can be added to\nspecify the project path.\n\nRun and Preview\n---------------\n\nQt is mostly used for creating graphical applications, so it won\u2019t be\nfun if you couldn\u2019t run and preview the application. WQt comes with two\nsuch commands which can help you preview and run your project code. The\nfirst such command is ``run``\n\n::\n\n    wqt run\n\nThis command will ``build`` the project and opens the ``executable``\nfile on your machine. This feature is supported on ``windows``,\n``mac OS`` and ``linux``. This does not work on ``windows subsystem`` or\nany other ``linux emulator`` running on ``windows``.\n\nThe other such command is ``preview-qml``. As the name suggest it helps\nyou preview the ``qml`` files in your project. For this command to work\nyour project application type has to be ``quick``. In order to find the\n``qml`` files in your project, the tool looks into the ``res/qml``\nfolder and shows you a list of those files. You can then run\n\n::\n\n    wqt list-qml\n\n::\n\n    wqt preview-qml <qml file name>\n\nAs a side note the tool accepts both the full name with extention and\nwithout extension.\n\nOther useful commands and features\n----------------------------------\n\n``list-libs``\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis command is useful if you want to see which ``Qt`` libraries are\nincluded in the project. These are the ``core Qt`` libraries and not\ncustom libraries.\n\n::\n\n    wqt list-libs\n\n``add-lib``\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis command is useful if you want to add a ``core Qt`` library to the\nproject. The tool will add this library to the ``config.json`` file and\nwill update the project for the changes to take an affect. Next time\nwhen the project builds, that library is used in the build. There are no\nchecks performed to see if this library being added is indeed\n``core Qt`` library.\n\n::\n\n    wqt add-lib <library name>\n\n``rm-lib``\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis command is useful if you want to remove a ``core Qt`` library from\nthe project. The tool will remove this library from the ``config.json``\nfile and will update the project for the changes to take an affect. Next\ntime when the project builds, that library is not used in the build.\n\n::\n\n    wqt add-lib <library name>\n\n``list-types``\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis command is is useful to see which ``Qt`` application types are\ncompatible with WQt. It will show the list of those application types.\n\n::\n\n    wqt list-types\n",
