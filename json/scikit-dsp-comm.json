    "description": "# scikit-dsp-comm\n## Package High Level Overview\nThis package is a collection of functions and classes to support signal processing and communications theory teaching and research. The foundation for this package is `scipy.signal`. The code base currently runs under Python 2.7x. An immediate need is to update the code to run under Python 3.6.\n\nThere are presently eight modules that make up scikit-dsp-comm: \n1. `sigsys.py` for basic signals and systems functions both continuous-time and discrete-time, including graphical display tools such as pole-zero plots, up-sampling and down-sampling.\n2. `digitalcomm.py` for digital modulation theory components, including asynchronous resampling and variable time delay functions, both useful in advanced modem testing.\n3. `synchronization.py` which contains phase-locked loop simulation functions and functions for carrier and phase synchronization of digital communications waveforms.\n4. `fec_conv.py` for the generation rate one-half convolutional codes and soft decision Viterbi algorithm decoding, including trellis and trellis-traceback display functions.\n5. `fir_design_helper.py` which for easy design of lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and bandstop filters using the Kaiser window and equal-ripple designs, also includes a list plotting function for easily comparing magnitude, phase, and group delay frequency responses.\n6. `iir_design_helper.py` which for easy design of lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and bandstop filters using scipy.signal Butterworth, Chebyshev I and II, and elliptical designs, including the use of the cascade of second-order sections (SOS) topology from scipy.signal, also includes a list plotting function for easily comparing of magnitude, phase, and group delay frequency responses.\n7. `multirate.py` that encapsulate digital filters into objects for filtering, interpolation by an integer factor, and decimation by an integer factor.\n8. `coeff2header.py` write C/C++ header files for FIR and IIR filters implemented in C/C++, using the cascade of second-order section representation for the IIR case. This last module find use in real-time signal processing on embedded systems, but can be used for simulation models in C/C++.\n\nPresently the collection of modules contains about 125 functions and classes. The authors/maintainers are working to get more detailed documentation in place.\n\n## Background\n The origin of this package comes from the writing the book Signals and Systems for Dummies, published by Wiley in 2013. The original module for this book is named `ssd.py`. In `scikit-dsp-comm` this module is renamed to `sigsys.py` to better reflect the fact that signal processing and communications theory is founded in signals and systems, a traditional subject in electrical engineering curricula.\n \n Until new documentation is ready to post, documentation from the original `ssd.py` module can be found at http://www.eas.uccs.edu/~mwickert/ssd/. Jupyter notebooks and PDF documents related to much of the remaining `scikit-dsp-comm` modules can be found under the various course home pages of http://www.eas.uccs.edu/~mwickert/.",
