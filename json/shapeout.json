    "description": "|ShapeOut|\n==========\n\n|PyPI Version| |Build Status Win| |Coverage Status|\n\n\nThis repository contains a graphical user interface for the analysis\nand visualization of RT-DC data sets. For more informaion please visit\nhttp://zellmechanik.com/.\n\n\nManual and User Guide\n---------------------\nThe manual and user guide can be found at http://www.zellmechanik.com/download.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\nInstallers for ShapeOut are available at the `release page <https://github.com/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/ShapeOut/releases>`__.\n\n\nCiting ShapeOut\n---------------\nPlease cite ShapeOut either in-line\n\n::\n\n  (...) using the analysis software ShapeOut version X.X.X (available at\n  https://github.com/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/ShapeOut).\n\nor in a bibliography\n\n::\n  \n  Paul M\u00fcller and others (2015), ShapeOut version X.X.X: Analysis software\n  for real-time deformability cytometry [Software]. Available at\n  https://github.com/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/ShapeOut.\n\nand replace ``X.X.X`` with the version of ShapeOut that you used.\n\n\nInformation for developers\n--------------------------\n\nRunning from source\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe easiest way to run ShapeOut from source is to use\n`Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`__. \n\n- **Windows**: Sketchy installation instructions are \n  `here <https://github.com/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/ShapeOut/tree/master/freeze_appveyor>`__ and \n  `here <https://github.com/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/ShapeOut/blob/master/appveyor.yml>`__.\n\n- **Debian**: Run `this script <https://github.com/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/ShapeOut/blob/master/develop/activate_linux.sh>`__\n  which will create a Python virtual environment.\n\n- **MacOS**: ShapeOut should work with Anaconda (see Windows above).\n  It is also possible to install all dependencies with MacPorts:\n\n  ::\n  \n    sudo port install python27 py27-ipython py27-scipy py27-matplotlib\n    sudo port install opencv +python27\n    sudo port install py27-wxpython-3.0 py27-statsmodels py27-kiwisolver py27-chaco py27-pip py27-simplejson py27-sip py27-macholib\n    sudo pip-2.7 install nptdms\n    sudo pip-2.7 install pyper\n\n\n  Then select python27 (macports) as standard python interpreter:\n\n  ::\n  \n    sudo port select --set python python27\n    sudo port select --set pip pip27\n\n  Check-out `dclab <https://github.com/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/dclab>`__ and\n  append the following command to ``~/.bash_profile``\n  \n  ::\n  \n    #!/bin/bash\n    export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/dclab\"\n\n  start ShapeOut with\n\n  ::\n  \n    python shapeout/ShapeOut.py\n\n  This can be put into a .command file placed on the Desktop.\n\n\n\nContributing\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe main branch for developing ShapeOut is ``develop``. Small changes that do not\nbreak anything can be submitted to this branch.\nIf you want to do big changes, please (fork ShapeOut and) create a separate branch,\ne.g. ``my_new_feature_dev``, and create a pull-request to ``develop`` once you are done making\nyour changes.\nPlease make sure to edit the \n`Changelog <https://github.com/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/ShapeOut/blob/master/CHANGELOG>`__. \n\n**Very important:** Please always try to use \n\n::\n\n\tgit pull --rebase\n\ninstead of\n\n::\n\n\tgit pull\n\t\nto prevent confusions in the commit history.\n\nTests\n~~~~~\nShapeOut is tested using pytest. If you have the time, please write test\nmethods for your code and put them in the ``tests`` directory. You may\nrun the tests manually by issuing:\n\n::\n\n    python setup.py test\n\t\n\nTest binaries\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAfter each commit to the ShapeOut repository, a binary installer is created\nby `Appveyor <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/paulmueller/ShapeOut>`__. Click\non a build and navigate to ``ARTIFACTS`` (upper right corner right under\nthe running time of the build). From there you can download the executable\nWindows installer.\n\n\nCreating releases\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPlease **do not** create releases when you want to test if something you\ndid works in the final Windows binary. Use the method described above to\ndo so. Releases should be created when improvements were made,\nbugs were resolved, or new features were introduced.\n\nProcedure\n_________\n1. Make sure that the `changelog (develop) <https://github.com/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/ShapeOut/blob/develop/CHANGELOG>`__\n   is updated and that the `version (develop) <https://github.com/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/ShapeOut/blob/develop/shapeout/_version.py>`__\n   is incremented.\n\n2. Create a pull request from develop into master using the web interface or simply run\n\n   ::\n\n       git checkout master  \n       git pull origin develop  \n       git push  \n\t\n3. Create the release at https://github.com/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/ShapeOut/releases.  \n   Make sure that the tag of the release follows the version format of ShapeOut\n   (e.g. `0.5.3`) and also name the release correctly (e.g. `ShapeOut 0.5.3`).\n   Also, copy and paste the change log of the new version into the comments of the release.\n   The first line of the release comments should contain the download counts shield like so:\n   \n   ::\n   \n       ![](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/ShapeOut/0.5.3/total.svg)\n   \n   The rest should contain the change log.  \n   Make sure to check `This is a pre-release` box.\n   \n4. Once the release is created, `Appveyor <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/paulmueller/ShapeOut>`__\n   will perform the build process and upload the installation files directly to the release. \n   If the binary works, edit the release and uncheck the `This is a pre-release` box.\n\n5. Make sure that all the changes you might have performed on the `master` branch are brought back\n   to ``develop``.\n   \n   ::\n\n       git checkout develop  \n       git pull origin master  \n       git pull --tags origin master\n       git push     \n\n\n.. |ShapeOut| image:: https://raw.github.com/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/ShapeOut/master/art/shapeout_logotype_h50.png\n.. |PyPI Version| image:: http://img.shields.io/pypi/v/ShapeOut.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dclab\n.. |Build Status Win| image:: https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/paulmueller/ShapeOut/master.svg?label=build_win\n   :target: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/paulmueller/ShapeOut\n.. |Coverage Status| image:: https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/ShapeOut/master.svg\n   :target: https://codecov.io/gh/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/ShapeOut",
