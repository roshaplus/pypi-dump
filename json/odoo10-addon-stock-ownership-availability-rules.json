    "description": "Stock Ownership Availability Rules\n==================================\n\nThis module extends the core behaviour to manage ownership of stock. It is\nuseful when we want to keep stock that belongs to someone other than our\ncompany.\n\nThis functionality is partially implemented in Odoo, with some missing\nbehaviour (e.g. it will silently deliver someone else's stock if that's all\nwe've got).\n\nThe purpose of this module is also to add tests that are missing in the Odoo\ncore.\n\nWith this module, the owner of quants becomes required, and is set by default\nas follows:\n\n- If the location of the quant has a partner, it is used.\n- Otherwise, if the location of the quant has a company, the related partner is\n  used.\n- Otherwise, the partner related to the default company for quants is used.\n\nThe tests make sure that the quants reservation always respect owners:\n\n- Outgoing pickings without owner or with company owner only reserve quants\n  with company owner, otherwise they remain unreserved.\n- Outgoing pickings with owner only reserve quants with the same owner,\n  otherwise they remain unreserved.\n\nTo understand stock owners more easily, now the \"On Hand\" button on the product\nform view opens a stock view grouped by location and owner (instead of location\nonly).\n\nPartially related to this is issue https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/4136.\n\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n* Leonardo Pistone <leonardo.pistone@camptocamp.com>",
