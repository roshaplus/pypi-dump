    "description": "420chan Python Library\n======================\nThe Bibliotheca Anonoma's **complete Python Wrapper for the 420chan API.**\nUses requests, respects if-modified-since headers on updating threads.\nCaches thread objects. Fun stuff.\n\nAn absolute must if you want to interface with or scrape from 4chan,\nusing a Python script.\n\n`Hosted Documentation <http://py420chan.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_\n\n`Github Repository <https://github.com/bibanon/py420chan>`_\n\nYou can install this library `straight from\nPyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py420chan>`_ with::\n\n    pip install py420chan\n\n\n**Getting Help**\n\nIf you want help, or you have some trouble using this library, our primary IRC channel\nis `#bibanon on irc.rizon.net <http://qchat2.rizon.net/?channels=bibanon>`_. Simply head\nin there and talk to dan or antonizoon. Otherwise, you can put a issue on our `Github\nIssue Tracker <https://github.com/bibanon/BASC-py4chan>`_ and we'll respond as soon as\nwe can!\n\n--------\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import py420chan\n    nom = py420chan.Board('nom')\n    thread = nom.get_thread(423491034)\n\n    print(thread)\n\n    for file in thread.file_objects():\n        print(file.file_url)\n        \n    # In a while...\n    print(\"I fetched\", thread.update(), \"new replies.\")\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThis library mostly extends the classes of `BASC-py4chan <https://github.com/bibanon/BASC-py4chan>`_, but has some differences. See the py8chan documentation for more info.\n\n`py420chan Documentation <http://py420chan.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_\n\nNotice that some functions are not implemented in the 420chan API. These functions will `raise an AttributeError when used. <http://stackoverflow.com/a/23126260>`_\n\n* omitted_posts - The lack of this feature forces us to ditch `expand()` and use `update()` instead.\n* omitted_images - Because the `omitted` attributes are missing, the `repr` no longer reports them.\n* filedeleted - The image will just 404 if it was deleted.\n* spoiler\n* images - No total of all images in the thread.\n* bumplimit\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n.. code:: text\n\n                DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE\n                        Version 2, December 2004\n\n     Copyright (C) 2004 Sam Hocevar <sam@hocevar.net>\n\n     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified\n     copies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long\n     as the name is changed.\n\n                DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE\n       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n      0.
