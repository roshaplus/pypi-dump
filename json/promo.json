In the first recording\r\n(examples/mary1.wav), \"Mary rolled the barrel\" was said in response\r\nto a question such as \"Did John roll the barrel?\".  On the other hand,\r\nin the second recording (examples/mary2.wav) the utterance was said \r\nin response to a question such as \"What happened yesterday\".\r\n\r\n\"Mary\" in \"mary1.wav\" is produced with more emphasis than in \"mary2.wav\".\r\nIt is longer and carries a more drammatic pitch excursion.  Using \r\nProMo, we can make mary1.wav spoken similar to mary2.wav, even\r\nthough they were spoken in a different way and by different speakers.\r\n\r\nDuration and pitch carry meaning.  Change these, and you can change the\r\nmeaning being conveyed.\r\n\r\n``Note that modifying pitch and duration too much can introduce artifacts. \r\nSuch artifacts can be heard even in pitch morphing mary1.wav to mary2.wav.``\r\n\r\nPitch morphing (examples/pitch_morph_example.py):\r\n\r\n    The following image shows morphing of pitch from mary1.wav to mary2.wav\r\n    on a word-by-word level\r\n    in increments of 33% (33%, 66%, 100%).  Note that the morph adjusts the\r\n    temporal dimension of the target signal to fit the duration of the source\r\n    signal (the source and generated contours are equally shorter \r\n    than the target contour).  This occurs at the level of the file unless\r\n    the user specifies an equal number of segments to align in time\r\n    (e.g. using word-level transcriptions, as done here, or phone-level\r\n    transcriptions, etc.)\r\n\r\n.. image:: examples/files/mary1_mary2_f0_morph.png\r\n   :width: 500px\r\n\r\nWith the ability to morph pitch range and average pitch, it becomes easier\r\nto morph contours produced by different speakers:\r\n\r\n    The following image shows four different pitch manipulations.  On the \r\n    **upper left** is the raw morph.  Notice that final output (black line) is\r\n    very close to the target.  Differences stem from duration differences.\r\n\r\n    However, the average pitch and pitch range are qualities of speech that\r\n    can signify differences in gender in addition to other aspects of\r\n    speaker identity.  By resetting the average pitch and pitch range to\r\n    that of the source, it is possible to morph the contour while maintaining\r\n    aspects of the source speaker's identity.\r\n\r\n    The image in the **upper right** contains a morph\r\n    followed by a reset of the average pitch to the source speaker's average\r\n    pitch.  In the **bottom right** a morph followed by a reset of the speaker's\r\n    pitch range.  In the **bottom right** pitch range was reset and then the\r\n    speaker's average pitch was reset.\r\n\r\n    The longer the speech sample, the more representative the pitch range and\r\n    mean pitch will be of the speaker.  In this example both are skewed higher\r\n    by the pitch accent on the first word.\r\n\r\n    Here the average pitch of the source (a female speaker) is much higher\r\n    than the target (a male speaker) and the resulting morph sounds like it\r\n    comes from a different speaker than the source or target speakers.\r\n    The three recordings that involve resetting pitch range and/or average\r\n    pitch sound much more natural.\r\n\r\n.. image:: examples/files/mary1_mary2_f0_morph_compare.png\r\n   :width: 500px\r\n\r\nDuration morphing (examples/duration_manipulation_example.py):\r\n\r\n    The following image shows morphing of duration from mary1.wav to mary2.wav\r\n    on a word-by-word basis in increments of 33% (33%, 66%, 100%).\r\n    This process can operate over an entire file or, similar to pitch morphing,\r\n    with annotated segments, as done in this example.\r\n\r\n.. image:: examples/files/mary1_mary2_dur_morph.png\r\n   :width: 500px\r\n\r\n\r\nTutorials\r\n================\r\n\r\nTutorials for learning about prosody manipulation and how to use ProMo are available.\r\n\r\n`Tutorial 1.1: Intro to ProMo <https://github.com/timmahrt/ProMo/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial1_1_intro_to_promo.ipynb>`_\r\n\r\n`Tutorial 1.2: Pitch manipulation tutorial <https://github.com/timmahrt/ProMo/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial1_2_pitch_manipulations.ipynb>`_\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor revisions\r\n================\r\n\r\nVer 1.3 (May 29, 2017)\r\n\r\n- added tutorials\r\n\r\n- f0Morph() can now exclude certain regions from the morph process if desired\r\n\r\nVer 1.2 (January 27, 2017)\r\n\r\n- added code for reshaping pitch accents (shift alignment, add plateau, or change height)\r\n\r\nVer 1.1 (February 22, 2016)\r\n\r\n- f0 morph code for modifying speaker pitch range and average pitch\r\n\r\n- (October 20, 2016) Added integration tests with travis CI and coveralls support.\r\n\r\nVer 1.0 (January 19, 2016)\r\n\r\n- first public release.\r\n\r\nBeta (July 1, 2013)\r\n\r\n- first version which was utilized in my dissertation work\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n==============\r\n\r\n``Python 2.7.*`` or above\r\n\r\n``Python 3.3.*`` or above (or below, probably)\r\n\r\nMy praatIO library is used extensively and can be downloaded \r\n`here <https://github.com/timmahrt/praatIO>`_\r\n\r\nMatplotlib is needed if you want to plot graphs.\r\n`Matplotlib website <http://matplotlib.org/>`_\r\n\r\nScipy is needed if you want to use interpolation--typically if you have stylized\r\npitch contours (in praat PitchTier format, for example) that you want to use in\r\nyour morphing).\r\n`Matplotlib website <http://scipy.org/>`_\r\n\r\nMatplotlib and SciPy are non-trivial to install, as they depends on several large\r\npackages.  You can\r\nvisit their websites for more information.  **I recommend the following instructions to\r\ninstall matplotlib** which uses *python wheels*.  These will install all required\r\nlibraries in one fell swoop.\r\n\r\nOn Mac, open a terminal and type:\r\n\r\n    sudo python -m pip install matplotlib\r\n\r\n    sudo python -m pip install scipy\r\n\r\nOn Windows, open a cmd or powershell window and type:\r\n\r\n    <<path to python>> -m install matplotlib\r\n\r\n    <<path to python>> -m install scipy\r\n\r\n    e.g. C:\\\\python27\\\\python.exe -m install matplotlib\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=========\r\n\r\nSee /examples for example usages\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n================\r\n\r\nIf you on Windows, you can use the installer found here (check that it is up to date though)\r\n`Windows installer <http://www.timmahrt.com/python_installers>`_\r\n\r\nPraatIO is on pypi and can be installed or upgraded from the command-line shell with pip like so::\r\n\r\n    pip install praatio --upgrade\r\n\r\nOtherwise, to manually install, after downloading the source from github, from a command-line shell, navigate to the directory containing setup.py and type::\r\n\r\n    python setup.py install\r\n\r\nIf python is not in your path, you'll need to enter the full path e.g.::\r\n\r\n    C:\\Python27\\python.exe setup.py install\r\n\r\n\r\nCiting ProMo\r\n===============\r\n\r\nIf you use ProMo in your research, please cite it like so:\r\n\r\nTim Mahrt.
