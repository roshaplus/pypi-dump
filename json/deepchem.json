Please make sure you follow the directions below precisely. While you may already have system versions of some of these packages, there is no guarantee that `deepchem` will work with alternate versions than those specified below.\n\nNote that when using Ubuntu 16.04 server or similar environments, you may need to ensure libxrender is provided via e.g.:\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install -y libxrender-dev\n```\n\n### Using a conda environment\nYou can install deepchem in a new conda environment using the conda commands in scripts/install_deepchem_conda.sh\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem.git      # Clone deepchem source code from GitHub\ncd deepchem\nbash scripts/install_deepchem_conda.sh deepchem\nsource activate deepchem\nconda install -c conda-forge tensorflow-gpu=1.3.0      # If you want GPU support\npython setup.py install                                # Manual install\nnosetests -a '!slow' -v deepchem --nologcapture        # Run tests\n```\nThis creates a new conda environment `deepchem` and installs in it the dependencies that\nare needed. To access it, use the `source activate deepchem` command.\nCheck [this link](https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html) for more information about\nthe benefits and usage of conda environments. **Warning**: Segmentation faults can [still happen](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/pull/379#issuecomment-277013514)\nvia this installation procedure.\n\n### Easy Install via Conda\n```bash\nconda install -c deepchem -c rdkit -c conda-forge -c omnia deepchem=1.3.0\n```\n\n### Installing Dependencies Manually\n\n1. Download the **64-bit** Python 2.7 or Python 3.5 versions of Anaconda for linux [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads#_unix).\n   Follow the [installation instructions](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install#linux-install)\n\n2. `rdkit`\n   ```bash\n   conda install -c rdkit rdkit\n   ```\n\n3. `joblib`\n   ```bash\n   conda install joblib\n   ```\n\n4. `six`\n   ```bash\n   pip install six\n   ```\n5. `networkx`\n   ```bash\n   conda install -c anaconda networkx=1.11\n   ```\n\n6. `mdtraj`\n   ```bash\n   conda install -c omnia mdtraj\n   ```\n\n7. `pdbfixer`\n   ```bash\n   conda install -c omnia pdbfixer=1.4\n   ```\n\n8. `tensorflow`: Installing `tensorflow` on older versions of Linux (which\n    have glibc < 2.17) can be very challenging. For these older Linux versions,\n    contact your local sysadmin to work out a custom installation. If your\n    version of Linux is recent, then the following command will work:\n    ```\n    pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.3.0\n    ```\n\n9. `deepchem`: Clone the `deepchem` github repo:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem.git\n   ```\n   `cd` into the `deepchem` directory and execute\n   ```bash\n   python setup.py install\n   ```\n\n10. To run test suite, install `nosetests`:\n   ```bash\n   pip install nose\n   ```\n   Make sure that the correct version of `nosetests` is active by running\n   ```bash\n   which nosetests\n   ```\n   You might need to uninstall a system install of `nosetests` if\n   there is a conflict.\n\n11. If installation has been successful, all tests in test suite should pass:\n    ```bash\n    nosetests -v deepchem --nologcapture\n    ```\n    Note that the full test-suite uses up a fair amount of memory.\n    Try running tests for one submodule at a time if memory proves an issue.\n\n### Using a Docker Image\nFor major releases we will create docker environments with everything pre-installed.\nIn order to get GPU support you will have to use the \n[nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) plugin.\n``` bash\n# This will the download the latest stable deepchem docker image into your images\ndocker pull deepchemio/deepchem\n\n# This will create a container out of our latest image with GPU support\nnvidia-docker run -i -t deepchemio/deepchem\n\n# You are now in a docker container whose python has deepchem installed\n# For example you can run our tox21 benchmark\ncd deepchem/examples\npython benchmark.py -d tox21\n\n# Or you can start playing with it in the command line\npip install jupyter\nipython\nimport deepchem as dc\n```\n\n## FAQ\n1. Question: I'm seeing some failures in my test suite having to do with MKL\n   ```Intel MKL FATAL ERROR: Cannot load libmkl_avx.so or libmkl_def.so.```\n\n   Answer: This is a general issue with the newest version of `scikit-learn` enabling MKL by default. This doesn't play well with many linux systems. See BVLC/caffe#3884 for discussions. The following seems to fix the issue\n   ```bash\n   conda install nomkl numpy scipy scikit-learn numexpr\n   conda remove mkl mkl-service\n   ```\n\n## Getting Started\nThe first step to getting started is looking at the examples in the `examples/` directory. Try running some of these examples on your system and verify that the models train successfully. Afterwards, to apply `deepchem` to a new problem, try starting from one of the existing examples and modifying it step by step to work with your new use-case.\n\n### Input Formats\nAccepted input formats for deepchem include csv, pkl.gz, and sdf files. For\nexample, with a csv input, in order to build models, we expect the\nfollowing columns to have entries for each row in the csv file.\n\n1. A column containing SMILES strings [1].\n2. A column containing an experimental measurement.\n3. (Optional) A column containing a unique compound identifier.\n\nHere's an example of a potential input file.\n\n|Compound ID    | measured log solubility in mols per litre | smiles         |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| benzothiazole | -1.5                                      | c2ccc1scnc1c2  |\n\n\nHere the \"smiles\" column contains the SMILES string, the \"measured log\nsolubility in mols per litre\" contains the experimental measurement and\n\"Compound ID\" contains the unique compound identifier.\n\n[2] Anderson, Eric, Gilman D. Veith, and David Weininger. \"SMILES, a line\nnotation and computerized interpreter for chemical structures.\" US\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, Environmental Research Laboratory, 1987.\n\n### Data Featurization\n\nMost machine learning algorithms require that input data form vectors.\nHowever, input data for drug-discovery datasets routinely come in the\nformat of lists of molecules and associated experimental readouts. To\ntransform lists of molecules into vectors, we need to subclasses of DeepChem\nloader class ```dc.data.DataLoader``` such as ```dc.data.CSVLoader``` or\n```dc.data.SDFLoader```. Users can subclass ```dc.data.DataLoader``` to\nload arbitrary file formats. All loaders must be\npassed a ```dc.feat.Featurizer``` object. DeepChem provides a number of\ndifferent subclasses of ```dc.feat.Featurizer``` for convenience.\n\n### Performances\nIn depth performance tables for DeepChem models are available on [MoleculeNet.ai](https://moleculenet.ai)\n\n### Gitter\nJoin us on gitter at [https://gitter.im/deepchem/Lobby](https://gitter.im/deepchem/Lobby). Probably the easiest place to ask simple questions or float requests for new features.\n\n## DeepChem Publications\n1.

DeepChem was originally created by [Bharath Ramsundar](http://rbharath.github.io/) with encouragement and guidance from [Vijay Pande](https://pande.stanford.edu/).\n\nDeepChem started as a [Pande group](https://pande.stanford.edu/) project at Stanford, and is now developed by many academic and industrial collaborators. DeepChem actively encourages new academic and industrial groups to contribute!\n\n## Corporate Supporters\nDeepChem is supported by a number of corporate partners who use DeepChem to solve interesting problems.\n\n### Schr\u00f6dinger\n[![Sch\u00f6dinger](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/blob/master/docs/source/_static/schrodinger_logo.png)](https://www.schrodinger.com/)\n\n> DeepChem has transformed how we think about building QSAR and QSPR models when very large data sets are available; and we are actively using DeepChem to investigate how to best combine the power of deep learning with next generation physics-based scoring methods.\n\n### DeepCrystal\n<img src=\"https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/blob/master/docs/source/_static/deep_crystal_logo.png\" alt=\"DeepCrystal Logo\" height=150px/>\n\n> DeepCrystal was an early adopter of DeepChem, which we now rely on to abstract away some of the hardest pieces of deep learning in drug discovery. By open sourcing these efficient implementations of chemically / biologically aware deep-learning systems, DeepChem puts the latest research into the hands of the scientists that need it, materially pushing forward the field of in-silico drug discovery in the process.\n\n\n## Version\n1.3.1",
