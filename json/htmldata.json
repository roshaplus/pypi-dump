    "description": "The htmldata module allows one to translate HTML\r\ndocuments back and forth to list data structures.\r\nThis allows for programmatic reading and writing\r\nof HTML documents, with much flexibility.\r\n\r\nFunctions are also available for extracting\r\nand/or modifying all URLs present in the HTML\r\nor stylesheets of a document.\r\n\r\nI have found this library useful for writing\r\nrobots, for \"wrapping\" all of the URLs on\r\nwebsites inside my own proxy CGI script, for\r\nfiltering HTML, and for doing flexible wget-like\r\nmirroring.\r\n\r\nIt keeps things as simple as possible, so it\r\nshould be easy to learn.\r\n\r\nSupports XHTML, too.",
