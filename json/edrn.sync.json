You don't have pip_?  You're seriously still using easy_install_?\nSigh::\n\n    easy_install edrn.sync\n\nThat's it.  (Of course, you might want to put it into a buildout_ or a\nvirtualenv_).\n\n\nFull Instructions\n=================\n\nedrn.sync requires the Python_ programming language.  We recommend version 2.4\nor later.  As of this writing, 2.7 is the latest stable version.  If Python is\nnot yet installed on your system, you can find binary and and source\ndistributions from the Python website.\n\nTo test if a correct version of Python is available on your system, run::\n\n    python -V\n    \nYou should see output similar to::\n\n    Python 2.7\n    \nindicating the version of Python installed.  edrn.sync also requires `Agile\nOODT`_.  OODT_ is Object Oriented Data Technology, a framework for metadata\nand data grids.  Agile OODT is a Python version of OODT that supports higher\nperformance and easier integration than the Java_ version.\n\nBy far the easiest, recommended, and encouraged way to install edrn.sync is\nto use pip_.  If your Python installation has pip available to it (and *all*\nvirtualenvs do), then this one command is all you need to run in order to\ndownload, build, install, and generate command-line tools all in one go::\n\n    pip install edrn.sync\n    \nThat will also download and install all dependencies, including Agile OODT.  \n\n\nExecutables\n-----------\n\nThe commands ``dmccsync`` and ``dmccgroupsync`` will be generated and placed\nwith your standard installation directory for Python commands.  Usually, this\nis the same location as the ``python`` executable itself.\n\n\nIssues and Questions\n====================\n\nTo report any problems with or ask for help about edrn.sync, visit our\ncontact_  web page.\n\n\n..

For more information see https://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CA-669.\n\nFor the issue tracker, see\nhttp://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CA.\n\n\n0.0.0 - Initial\n===============\n\nThis is an initial release of EDRN (EDRN_) Sync Services supporting minimal ``dmccsync``\nfunctionality.\n\n\n..
