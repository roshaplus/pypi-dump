This tool logs into ADFS and then requests your Duo multi-factor authentication token.  Once approved, AWS generates temporary access credentials which grant you access to an AWS account for a period of up to 8 hours.  This tool saves them as an AWS profile (default, by default) which you can immediately use.\n\nFrom: [https://github.com/IrdetoOSS/irdeto-aws-adfs](https://github.com/IrdetoOSS/irdeto-aws-adfs)\n\n# Requirements\n\n  - Python + Pip\n  - (on unix) LibXML2 Headers and OpenSSL Headers\n    - (on fresh Ubuntu 16.04) `sudo apt-get install python-pip libxml2-dev libssl-dev`\n    - (on fresh Ubuntu 14.04)\n      ```\n      sudo apt-get install python-pip libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev python-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev\n      pip install -U pip\n      pip freeze --local | grep -v '^\\-e' | cut -d = -f 1  | xargs -n1 pip install -U\n      ```\n  - (on Windows) Install Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)\n  - (on OS-X) None!\n\n# Installation\n\n* Simple pip-based installation with...\n\n    ```\n    pip install irdeto-aws-adfs\n    ```\n\n# Example of usage\n\n* Login to ADFS and write to the \"default\" profile, so you can begin using aws cli\n\n    ```\n    irdeto-aws-adfs\n    ```\n\n    and verification that you logged in successfully\n\n    ```\n    aws s3 ls\n    ```\n\n![IRDeto Logo](screenshots/example.gif)\n\n\n* If you don't want to use the default profile, then specify the profile name\n\n    ```\n    irdeto-aws-adfs login --profile=irdeto\n    ```\n\n    and verification that you logged in successfully using that profile\n\n    ```\n    aws --profile=irdeto s3 ls\n    ```\n\n* Remove that profile you just added (in-case it expired)\n    ```\n    irdeto-aws-adfs reset --profile=irdeto\n    ```\n\n* For other options and information/help, use --help\n\n    ```\n    $ irdeto-aws-adfs --help\n    Usage: irdeto-adfs [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n\n    Options:\n      --version      Show current tool version\n      -v, --verbose  Enables debug information on stdout.
