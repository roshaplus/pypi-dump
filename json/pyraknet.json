    "description": "pyraknet allows you to concentrate on your game or application rather\nthen writing a your own networking code. It is straightforward to implement\nand you only need a small amount of UDP networking knowledge.\n\n* Easy to implement\n* Cross platform\n* High performance\n* Low bandwidth overhead\n* Automatic peer management. Each client is assigned an identifier.\n* Optonally specify packets to be reliable -- packets will automatically\n  resend themselves if dropped.\n* Optonally specify packets to arrive in the right order, or to be discarded\n  if it receives an old packet.",
