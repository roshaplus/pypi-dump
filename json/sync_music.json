    "description": "sync_music - Sync music library to external devices\n===================================================\n\nThis program allows you to synchronize your music library for the usage\non primitive music players that don't support the diversity of your\ncollection.\n\nIn normal operation mode, sync_music performs its synchronization tasks\ndepending on the input file format. Music files in FLAC and Ogg Vorbis\nformat are transcoded to MP3. MP3 audio files and other files are\ntransferred unchanged. Filenames are adapted where necessary to comply\nwith the FAT32 format.\n\nTranscoding is a time consuming operation, therefore the first run of\nsync_music can take several minutes. In subsequent runs however, it will\nonly process files that changed in the source. To optimize the detection of\nfile changes, the script stores and compares a hash build on a fixed size\nblock at the beginning of each file.\n\nBesides audio files, sync_music is also able to export M3U playlists to\nthe destination folder. Absolute paths are hereby replaced with relative\npaths in addition to the FAT32 filename adaptations.\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\n- Python 3.4\n- Python Audio Tools >= 3.0 (for transcoding to MP3)\n- Mutagen >= 1.29 (for tag manipulation)\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n    pip3 install --process-dependency-links sync_music.zip\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n    sync_music --audio-src=<FOLDER> --audio-dest=<FOLDER>\n\nM3U Playlist syncing can be enabled by specifying the path to the\nplaylist with the `--playlist-src=<FOLDER>` parameter.\n\nSome media players don't properly support album artist tags, but they do\nsupport the composer field. This restriction can be bypassed by writing\nthe album artist information into the composer field. This can be\nenabled by the `--albumartist-hack`\n\nSome media players don't properly support disc number tags with tracks numbered\nstarting with 1 for every disc. The user typically wants to group them by disc\nand not by track position. This can be solved by creating a different album for\neach disc. With the `--discnumber-hack` option, the disc number is appended\nto the album field.\n\nSome media players don't properly support track number tags containing the\ntotal number of tracks on the disk. With the `--tracknumber-hack` option, the\ntrack total is removed from the track number field.\n\nCall sync_music with `--help` to get a full list of supported command\nline parameters.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
