    "description": "Cloud Wiki was implemented as a response to the lack of Python wiki servers that\r\nare intended to run as an individual server process and provide functionality to\r\nmeet its designer's needs.\r\n\r\nCloud Wiki's nodes are stored in a sqlite database, and served using python's\r\nBaseHTTPServer, running as a long lived application service.  Wiki markup is a\r\nsimple unobtrusive dialect, providing free linking, images, tables, unordered\r\nlists and preformatted text blocks. Rendered content data is stored in the\r\ndatabase, along with content change information, to improve server response times.\r\n\r\nCloud Wiki supports user authentication, but does not currently provide an\r\nregistration interface of its own -- the authentication system is designed to be\r\nmodular and easily extended by adding functionality to check passwords from\r\nother existing databases or to periodically import them using a cron script.",
