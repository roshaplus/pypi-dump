Until we make a\n1.0 release, you probably should not use Flintrock unless you are ready\nto keep up with frequent changes to how it works.** Python hackers or\nheavy spark-ec2 users who are looking to experiment with something new\nare welcome to try Flintrock out and potentially even\n`contribute <https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nHere's a quick way to launch a cluster on EC2, assuming you already have\nan `AWS account set\nup <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ec2.html>`__.\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    flintrock launch test-cluster \\\n        --num-slaves 1 \\\n        --spark-version 2.1.0 \\\n        --ec2-key-name key_name \\\n        --ec2-identity-file /path/to/key.pem \\\n        --ec2-ami ami-0b33d91d \\\n        --ec2-user ec2-user\n\nIf you `persist these options to a file <#configurable-cli-defaults>`__,\nyou'll be able to do the same thing simply by typing:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    flintrock launch test-cluster\n\nOnce you're done using a cluster, don't forget to destroy it with:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    flintrock destroy test-cluster\n\nOther things you can do with Flintrock include:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    flintrock login test-cluster\n    flintrock describe test-cluster\n    flintrock add-slaves test-cluster --num-slaves 2\n    flintrock remove-slaves test-cluster --num-slaves 1\n    flintrock run-command test-cluster 'sudo yum install -y package'\n    flintrock copy-file test-cluster /local/path /remote/path\n\nTo see what else Flintrock can do, or to see detailed help for a\nspecific command, try:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    flintrock --help\n    flintrock <subcommand> --help\n\nThat's not all. Flintrock has a few more `features <#features>`__ that\nyou may find interesting.\n\nAccessing data on S3\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWe recommend you access data on S3 from your Flintrock cluster by\nfollowing these steps:\n\n1. Setup an `IAM\n   Role <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html>`__\n   that grants access to S3 as desired. Reference this role when you\n   launch your cluster using the ``--ec2-instance-profile-name`` option\n   (or its equivalent in your ``config.yaml`` file).\n2. Reference S3 paths in your Spark code using the ``s3a://`` prefix.\n   ``s3a://`` is backwards compatible with ``s3n://`` and replaces both\n   ``s3n://`` and ``s3://``. The Hadoop project `recommends using\n   ``s3a://`` <https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-aws/tools/hadoop-aws/index.html#S3A>`__\n   since it is actively developed, supports larger files, and offers\n   better performance.\n3. Make sure Flintrock is configured to use Hadoop/HDFS 2.7+. Earlier\n   versions of Hadoop do not have solid implementations of ``s3a://``.\n   Flintrock's default is Hadoop 2.7.3, so you don't need to do anything\n   here if you're using a vanilla configuration.\n\nWith this approach you don't need to copy around your AWS credentials or\npass them into your Spark programs. As long as the assigned IAM role\nallows it, Spark will be able to read and write data to S3 simply by\nreferencing the appropriate path (e.g. ``s3a://bucket/path/to/file``).\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nBefore using Flintrock, take a quick look at the\n`copyright <https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/blob/master/COPYRIGHT>`__\nnotice and\n`license <https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/blob/master/LICENSE>`__\nand make sure you're OK with their terms.\n\n**Flintrock requires Python 3.4 or newer**, unless you are using one of\nour **standalone packages**. Flintrock has been thoroughly tested only\non OS X, but it should run on all POSIX systems. A motivated contributor\nshould be able to add `Windows\nsupport <https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/issues/46>`__ without too\nmuch trouble, too.\n\nRelease version\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo get the latest release of Flintrock, simply run\n`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__:\n\n::\n\n    pip3 install flintrock\n\nThis will install Flintrock and place it on your path. You should be\ngood to go now!\n\nYou'll probably want to get started with the following two commands:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    flintrock --help\n    flintrock configure\n\nStandalone version (Python not required!)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you don't have a recent enough version of Python, or if you don't\nhave Python installed at all, you can still use Flintrock. We publish\nstandalone packages of Flintrock on GitHub with our\n`releases <https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/releases>`__.\n\nFind the standalone package for your OS under our `latest\nrelease <https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/releases/latest>`__,\nunzip it to a location of your choice, and run the ``flintrock``\nexecutable inside.\n\nFor example:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    flintrock_version=\"0.8.0\"\n\n    curl --location --remote-name \"https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/releases/download/v$flintrock_version/Flintrock-$flintrock_version-standalone-OSX-x86_64.zip\"\n    unzip -q -d flintrock \"Flintrock-$flintrock_version-standalone-OSX-x86_64.zip\"\n    cd flintrock/\n\n    # You're good to go!\n    ./flintrock --help\n\nYou'll probably want to add the location of the Flintrock executable to\nyour ``PATH`` so that you can invoke it from any directory.\n\nDevelopment version\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you like living on the edge, install the development version of\nFlintrock:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    pip3 install git+https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock\n\nIf you want to\n`contribute <https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__,\nfollow the instructions in our contributing guide on `how to install\nFlintrock <https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-code>`__.\n\nUse Cases\n---------\n\nExperimentation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you want to play around with Spark, develop a prototype application,\nrun a one-off job, or otherwise just experiment, Flintrock is the\nfastest way to get you a working Spark cluster.\n\nPerformance testing\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFlintrock exposes many options of its underlying providers (e.g.\nEBS-optimized volumes on EC2) which makes it easy to create a cluster\nwith predictable performance for `Spark performance\ntesting <https://github.com/databricks/spark-perf>`__.\n\nAutomated pipelines\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMost people will use Flintrock interactively from the command line, but\nFlintrock is also designed to be used as part of an automated pipeline.\nFlintrock's exit codes are carefully chosen; it offers options to\ndisable interactive prompts; and when appropriate it prints output in\nYAML, which is both human- and machine-friendly.\n\nAnti-Use Cases\n--------------\n\nThere are some things that Flintrock specifically *does not* support.\n\nManaging permanent infrastructure\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFlintrock is not for managing long-lived clusters, or any infrastructure\nthat serves as a permanent part of some environment.\n\nFor starters, Flintrock provides no guarantee that clusters launched\nwith one version of Flintrock can be managed by another version of\nFlintrock, and no considerations are made for any long-term use cases.\n\nIf you are looking for ways to manage permanent infrastructure, look at\ntools like `Terraform <https://www.terraform.io/>`__,\n`Ansible <http://www.ansible.com/>`__,\n`SaltStack <http://saltstack.com/>`__, or `Ubuntu\nJuju <http://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/tools/juju>`__. You might also find a\nservice like `Databricks <https://databricks.com/product/databricks>`__\nuseful if you're looking for someone else to host and manage Spark for\nyou. Amazon also offers `Spark on\nEMR <https://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/details/spark/>`__.\n\nLaunching non-Spark-related services\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFlintrock is meant for launching Spark clusters that include closely\nrelated services like HDFS, Mesos, and YARN.\n\nFlintrock is not for launching external datasources (e.g. Cassandra), or\nother services that are not closely integrated with Spark (e.g. Tez).\n\nIf you are looking for an easy way to launch other services from the\nHadoop ecosystem, look at the `Apache\nBigtop <http://bigtop.apache.org/>`__ project.\n\nLaunching out-of-date services\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFlintrock will always take advantage of new features of Spark and\nrelated services to make the process of launching a cluster faster,\nsimpler, and easier to maintain. If that means dropping support for\nlaunching older versions of a service, then we will generally make that\ntradeoff.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nPolished CLI\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFlintrock has a clean command-line interface.\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    flintrock --help\n    flintrock describe\n    flintrock destroy --help\n    flintrock launch test-cluster --num-slaves 10\n\nConfigurable CLI Defaults\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFlintrock lets you persist your desired configuration to a YAML file so\nthat you don't have to keep typing out the same options over and over at\nthe command line.\n\nTo setup and edit the default config file, run this:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    flintrock configure\n\nYou can also point Flintrock to a non-default config file by using the\n``--config`` option.\n\nSample ``config.yaml``\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n.. code:: yaml\n\n    provider: ec2\n\n    services:\n      spark:\n        version: 2.1.0\n\n    launch:\n      num-slaves: 1\n\n    providers:\n      ec2:\n        key-name: key_name\n        identity-file: /path/to/.ssh/key.pem\n        instance-type: m3.medium\n        region: us-east-1\n        ami: ami-0b33d91d\n        user: ec2-user\n\nWith a config file like that, you can now launch a cluster with just\nthis:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    flintrock launch test-cluster\n\nAnd if you want, you can even override individual options in your config\nfile at the command line:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    flintrock launch test-cluster \\\n        --num-slaves 10 \\\n        --ec2-instance-type r3.xlarge\n\nFast Launches\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFlintrock is really fast. This is how quickly it can launch fully\noperational clusters on EC2 compared to\n`spark-ec2 <https://github.com/amplab/spark-ec2>`__.\n\nSetup\n^^^^^\n\n-  Provider: EC2\n-  Instance type: ``m3.large``\n-  AMI:\n\n   -  Flintrock: `Default Amazon Linux\n      AMI <https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/>`__\n   -  spark-ec2: `Custom spark-ec2\n      AMI <https://github.com/amplab/spark-ec2/tree/a990752575cd8b0ab25731d7820a55c714798ec3/ami-list>`__\n\n-  Launch time: Best of 6 tries\n\nResults\n^^^^^^^\n\n+----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+\n| Cluster Size   | Flintrock Launch Time   | spark-ec2 Launch Time   |\n+================+=========================+=========================+\n| 1 slave        | 2m 06s                  | 8m 44s                  |\n+----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+\n| 50 slaves      | 2m 30s                  | 37m 30s                 |\n+----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+\n| 100 slaves     | 2m 42s                  | 1h 06m 05s              |\n+----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+\n\nThe spark-ec2 launch times are sourced from\n`SPARK-5189 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-5189>`__.\n\nNote that AWS performance is highly variable, so you will not get these\nresults consistently. They show the best case scenario for each tool,\nand not the typical case. For Flintrock, the typical launch time will be\na minute or two longer.\n\nAdvanced Storage Setup\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFlintrock automatically configures any available `ephemeral\nstorage <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html>`__\non the cluster and makes it available to installed services like HDFS\nand Spark. This storage is fast and is perfect for use as a temporary\nstore by those services.\n\nTests\n~~~~~\n\nFlintrock comes with a set of automated, end-to-end\n`tests <https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/tree/master/tests>`__.\nThese tests help us develop Flintrock with confidence and guarantee a\ncertain level of quality.\n\nLow-level Provider Options\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFlintrock exposes low-level provider options (e.g. `instance-initiated\nshutdown\nbehavior <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html#Using_ChangingInstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior>`__)\nso you can control the details of how your cluster is setup if you want.\n\nNo Custom Machine Image Dependencies\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFlintrock is built and tested against vanilla Amazon Linux and CentOS.\nYou can easily launch Flintrock clusters using your own custom machine\nimages built from either of those distributions.\n\nAnti-Features\n-------------\n\nSupport for out-of-date versions of Python, EC2 APIs, etc.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSupporting multiple versions of anything is tough. There's more surface\narea to cover for testing, and over the long term the maintenance burden\nof supporting something non-current with bug fixes and workarounds\nreally adds up.\n\nThere are projects that support stuff across a wide cut of language or\nAPI versions. For example, Spark supports Java 7 and 8, and Python 2.6+\nand 3+. The people behind these projects are gods. They take on an\nimmense maintenance burden for the benefit and convenience of their\nusers.\n\nWe here at project Flintrock are much more modest in our abilities. We\nare best able to serve the project over the long term when we limit\nourselves to supporting a small but widely applicable set of\nconfigurations.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\n*Note: The explanation here is provided from the perspective of\nFlintrock's original author, Nicholas Chammas. spark-ec2 is still an\nactive project, so the problems described below may no longer exist.\nHowever, they were all present at the time Flintrock was created.*\n\nI got started with Spark by using\n`spark-ec2 <https://github.com/amplab/spark-ec2>`__. It's one of the\nbiggest reasons I found Spark so accessible. I didn't need to spend time\nupfront working through some setup guide before I could work on a \"real\"\nproblem. Instead, with a simple spark-ec2 command I was able to launch a\nlarge, working cluster and get straight to business.\n\nAs I became a heavy user of spark-ec2, several limitations stood out and\nbecame an increasing pain. They provided me with the motivation for this\nproject.\n\nAmong those limitations were:\n\n-  **Slow launches**: spark-ec2 cluster launch times increase linearly\n   with the number of slaves being created. For example, it takes\n   spark-ec2 **`over an\n   hour <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-5189>`__** to\n   launch a cluster with 100 slaves.\n   (`SPARK-4325 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-4325>`__,\n   `SPARK-5189 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-5189>`__)\n-  **No support for configuration files**: spark-ec2 does not support\n   reading options from a config file, so users are always forced to\n   type them in at the command line.\n   (`SPARK-925 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-925>`__)\n-  **Un-resizable clusters**: Adding or removing slaves from an existing\n   spark-ec2 cluster is not possible.\n   (`SPARK-2008 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-2008>`__)\n-  **Custom machine images**: spark-ec2 uses custom machine images, and\n   since the process of updating those machine images is not automated,\n   they have not been updated in years.\n   (`SPARK-3821 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-3821>`__)\n-  **Unexposed EC2 options**: spark-ec2 does not expose all the EC2\n   options one would want to use as part of automated performance\n   testing of Spark.\n   (`SPARK-6220 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-6220>`__)\n-  **Poor support for programmatic use cases**: spark-ec2 was not built\n   with programmatic use in mind, so many flows are difficult or\n   impossible to automate.\n   (`SPARK-5627 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-5627>`__,\n   `SPARK-5629 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-5629>`__)\n-  **No standalone distribution**: spark-ec2 comes bundled with Spark\n   and has no independent releases or distribution. Instead of being a\n   nimble tool that can progress independently and be installed\n   separately, it is tied to Spark's release cycle and distributed with\n   Spark, which clocks in at a few hundred megabytes.\n\nFlintrock addresses all of these shortcomings.\n\nWhy didn't you build Flintrock on top of an orchestration tool?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPeople have asked me whether I considered building Flintrock on top of\nAnsible, Terraform, Docker, or something else. I looked into some of\nthese things back when Flintrock was just an idea in my head and decided\nagainst using any of them for two basic reasons:\n\n1. **Fun**: I didn't have any experience with these tools, and it looked\n   both simple enough and more fun to build something \"from scratch\".\n2. **Focus**: I wanted a single-purpose tool with a very limited focus,\n   not a module or set of scripts that were part of a sprawling\n   framework that did a lot of different things.\n\nThese are not necessarily the right reasons to build \"from scratch\", but\nthey were my reasons. If you are already comfortable with any of the\npopular orchestration tools out there, you may find it more attractive\nto use them rather than add a new standalone tool to your toolchain.\n\nAbout the Flintrock Logo\n------------------------\n\nThe `Flintrock\nlogo <https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/blob/master/flintrock-logo.png>`__\nwas created using `Highbrow Cafetorium\nJNL <http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/highbrow-cafetorium/>`__ and\n`this icon <https://thenounproject.com/term/stars/40856/>`__.
