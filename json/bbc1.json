    "description": "Core system of BBc-1 (Beyond Blockchain One)\n===========================================\nThis project is a Python-based reference implementation of BBc-1, a trustable system of record keeping beyond blockchains.\n\nThe design paper (white paper) and the analysis paper are available [here](https://beyond-blockchain.org/public/bbc1-design-paper.pdf) and [here](https://beyond-blockchain.org/public/bbc1-analysis.pdf). BBc-1 is inspired from blockchain technologies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger projects, and so on.\nBBc-1 is a simple but reliable distributed ledger system in contrast with huge and complicated existing blockchain platforms.\nThe heart of BBc-1 is the transaction data structure and the relationship among transactions, which forms a graph topology.\nA transaction should be signed by the players who are the stake holders of the deal. BBc-1 achieves data integrity and data transparency by the topology of transaction relationship and signatures on transactions. Simply put, BBc-1 does not have *blocks*, and therefore, requires neither mining nor native cryptocurrency.\nBBc-1 can be applied to both private/enterprise use and public use. BBc-1 has a concept of *domain* for determining a region of data management. Any networking implementation (like Kademlia for P2P topology management) can be applied for each domain.\nAlthough there are many TODOs in BBc-1, this reference implementation includes most of the concept of BBc-1 and would work in private/enterprise systems. When sophisticated P2P algorithms are ready, BBc-1 will be able to support public use cases.\n\nEvery directory includes README.md. Please read it for the details. Furthermore, directory docs/ includes documents and slide decks (PDF) that explain the design of the BBc-1 and its implementation.\n\n# Environment\n\n* Python\n    - Python 3.6.0 or later\n\n* tools (for macOS by Homebrew)\n    - libtool\n    - automake\n    - geth and solidity are required if Ethereum ledger subsystem is to be used\n\n# Quick start\n\n## From source code in github\n1. Install tools (libtool, automake)\n2. Install python and pip\n3. Clone this project\n4. Install dependencies by the following command.\n    ```\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n5. Start bbc_core.py on a terminal\n    ```\n    cd core\n    python bbc_core.py\n    ```\n6. Start a sample app in another terminal\n    ```\n    cd examples\n    python file_proof.py arg1 arg2..\n    ```\n\n\n## Use pip\n1. Install tools (libtool, automake)\n2. Install python and pip\n3. Install BBc1 by pip\n    ```\n    pip install bbc1\n    ```\n\n## Use docker (See README.md in docker/)\n0. Install docker on your host\n1. Clone this project\n2. Build docker image\n    If you want source codes in your container,\n    ```\n    cd docker\n    ./docker-bbc1.sh gitbuild\n    ```\n    or, if you just want to use BBc-1,\n    ```\n    cd docker\n    ./docker-bbc1.sh pipbuild\n    ```\n3. Run a docker container\n    ```\n    ./docker-bbc1.sh start\n    ```\n4. Log in to the container\n    ```\n    ./docker-bbc1.sh shell\n    ```\n    or\n    ```\n    ssh -p 10022 root@localhost\n    ```\n    The initial password is \"bbc1\".\n\n### working directory\nThe working directory of BBc-1 on the docker container is mounted on docker/data/.bbc1/. You will find a config file, ledger DB and file storage directory in the working directory.\n\n\n# Files/Directories\n* core/\n    - core functions of BBc-1\n* app/\n    - SDK for applications using BBc-1\n* common/\n    - libraries and utilities for both core and app\n* utils/\n    - BBc-1 system configuration utilities\n* examples/\n    - sample applications on BBc-1\n* docker/\n    - docker environments\n* tests/\n    - test codes for pytest\n* docs/\n    - docs about BBc-1 and its reference implementation\n* somewhere/.bbc1/\n    - default working directory name of bbc_core.py\n* requirements.txt\n    - for pip install\n* setup.py\n* MANIFEST.in\n    - for creatign python modules\n",
