    "description": "Cagey\n=====\n\nA command-line interface for wrangling Velociraptor swarms and automating\nsome common operations.\n\nImplementation\n==============\n\nThis implementation does not rely on any APIs except the conventions of the\nmain HTTP-based interface. It parses and submits forms.\n\nFeatures\n========\n\n``cagey`` supports several sub-commands, including:\n\n - build\n - swarm\n - rebuild-all\n\nBuild\n-----\n\nSimply assemble a build of an app at a given tag. This routine is useful to\nprime an build before doing other swarm operations.\n\nSwarm\n-----\n\nThis routine will invoke the swarm operation on a swarm at a given tag::\n\n    cagey swarm MyApp-Recipe_.* 3.0 -x Recipe_Skipped\n\nIt takes as its parameters a filter of swarm name, a version number, and\noptionally some excludes.\n\nThe name filter is case sensitive, but the excludes are case insensitive.\n\nWhen the command is executed, the routine will first report which swarms will\nbe affected and give a 5 second timer in case the matches were not what the\nuser intended. If the routine is not cancelled, it will proceed to swarm each\nswarm in turn.\n\nRebuild All\n-----------\n\nThis routine will find swarms matching the filter and peform a forced rebuild,\nre-release, and swarm on those swarms such that they are rebuilt whether or\nnot Velociraptor believes there's any advantage to rebuilding. This routine\nwill become largely obviated if `Velociraptor issue 19\n<https://bitbucket.org/yougov/velociraptor/issue/19>`_ is implemented.\n\n    cagey rebuild-all MyApp",
