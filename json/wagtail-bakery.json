Please read their [documentation](https://django-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for detailed configuration and how to build default Django flat files. Yes. Wagtail-bakery is not limited to build Wagtail pages specifically, mixed content is possible!\n\n## Features\n\n* Single management command that will build your Wagtail site out as flat files\n* Support for multisite, [theming](https://github.com/moorinteractive/wagtail-themes) and [multilingual](http://docs.wagtail.io/en/latest/advanced_topics/i18n/index.html) setup\n* Support for `i18n_patterns`\n* Ready to use Wagtail Buildable views to build all your (un)published pages at once (no extra code required!)\n\n## Installation\n\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/moorinteractive/wagtail-bakery.git#egg=wagtail-bakery\n```\n\nAdd `bakery` and `wagtailbakery` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting.\n\n```python\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\n    # ...\n    'bakery',\n    'wagtailbakery',\n)\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nDefine whether you want to build multiple sites or the default site (see examples for impact on directory output), by default this settings is `False`.\n\n```python\nBAKERY_MULTISITE = True\n```\n\nAdd the build directory where you want to be the site be built as flat files.\n\n```python\nBUILD_DIR = '/tmp/build/'\n```\n\nAs you may know with Django bakery, the trickiest part is to make your current models/pages buildable with [Buildable views](https://django-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/buildableviews.html). As Django Wagtail uses only the `Page` model at their lowest level, you can use at least one of the already present Buildable views provided by Wagtail bakery.\n\nBuild all published public pages (use for production).\n\n```python\nBAKERY_VIEWS = (\n\t'wagtailbakery.views.AllPublishedPagesView',\n)\n```\n\nBuild all published and unpublished public pages (use for staging/acceptance).\n\n```python\nBAKERY_VIEWS = (\n\t'wagtailbakery.views.AllPagesView',\n)\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nBuild the site out as flat files by running the `build` management command.\n\n```\nmanage.py build\n```\n\nIf you want to check how your static website will look, use the `buildserver` command after you have build your static files once.\n\n```\nmanage.py buildserver\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nIn the [examples](https://github.com/moorinteractive/wagtail-bakery/tree/master/examples) directory you can find a Wagtail setup with fixtures for a single site as well as a multisite setup.\n\nCreate a virtualenv and go to one of the examples, you can use the `Make` command to install all requirements, load fixtures and run the server.\n\nAs described in the usage section, use `manage.py build` to build out the example as static files.\n\n**Build output with `BAKERY_MULTISITE=True`**:\n\n```\nbuild/example.com/index.html\nbuild/example.com/about/index.html\nbuild/example.com/blog/index.html\nbuild/example.com/blog/example/index.html\nbuild/static/\n```\n\n**Build output with `BAKERY_MULTISITE=False` (default)**:\n\n```\nbuild/index.html\nbuild/about/index.html\nbuild/blog/index.html\nbuild/blog/example/index.html\nbuild/static/\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nFor issues [please submit an issue](https://github.com/moorinteractive/wagtail-bakery/issues/new) on GitHub.\n\n## Credits\n\nThanks to [@mhnbcu](https://github.com/mhnbcu/wagtailbakery) for bringing this\nidea up initially, and [Django Bakery](https://github.com/datadesk/django-bakery)\nfor providing the initial bakery package.\n",
