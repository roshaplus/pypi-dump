    "description": "Pyroomacoustics\n===============\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/LCAV/pyroomacoustics.svg?branch=pypi-release\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/LCAV/pyroomacoustics\n.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyroomacoustics/badge/?version=latest\n    :target: http://pyroomacoustics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n    :alt: Documentation Status\n\nConsider the following scenario.\n\n  Suppose, for example, you wanted to produce a radio crime drama, and it\n  so happens that, according to the scriptwriter, the story line absolutely must culminate\n  in a satanic mass that quickly degenerates into a violent shootout, all taking place\n  right around the altar of the higly reverberant acoustic environment of Oxford's\n  Christ Church cathedral. To ensure that it sounds authentic, you asked the Dean of\n  Christ Church for permission to record the final scene inside the cathedral, but\n  somehow he fails to be convinced of the artistic merit of your production, and declines\n  to give you permission. But recorded in a conventional studio, the scene sounds flat.\n  So what do you do ?\n\n  -- Schnupp, Nelken, and King, *Auditory Neuroscience*, 2010\n\nFaced with this difficult situation, **pyroomacoustics** can save the day by simulating\nthe environment of the Christ Church cathedral!\n\nPyroomacoustics is a pure python package for audio signal processing for indoor\napplications. It was developped as a fast prototyping platform for beamforming\nalgorithms in indoor scenarios. At the core of the package is a room impulse\nresponse generator based on the image source model that can handle\n\n* Convex and non-convex rooms\n* 2D/3D rooms\n\nThe philosophy of the package is to abstract all necessary elements of\nan experiment using object oriented programming concept. Each of these elements\nis represented using a class and an experiment can be designed by combining\nthese elements just as one would do in a real experiment.\n\nLet's imagine we want to simulate a delay and sum beamformer that uses a linear\narray with four microphones in a shoe box shaped room that contains only one\nsource of sound. First, we create a room object, to which we add a microphone\narray object, and a sound source object. Then, the room object has methods\nto compute the RIR between source and receiver. The beamformer object then extends\nthe microphone array class and has different methods to compute the weights, for\nexample delay-and-sum weights. See the example below to get an idea of what the\ncode looks like.\n\nThe `Room` class allows in addition to process sound samples emitted by sources,\neffectively simulating the propagation of sound between sources and microphones.\nAt the input of the microphone composing the beamformer, an STFT (short time\nFourier transform) engine allows to quickly process the signals through the\nbeamformer and evaluate the ouput.\n\nQuick Install\n-------------\n\nInstall the package with pip::\n\n    $ pip install pyroomacoustics\n\nThe requirements are::\n\n* numpy \n* scipy \n* matplotlib\n\nExample\n-------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import numpy as np\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    import pyroomacoustics as pra\n\n    # Create a 4 by 6 metres shoe box room\n    room1 = pra.ShoeBox([4,6])\n\n    # Add a source somewhere in the room\n    room1.addSource([2.5, 4.5])\n\n    # Create a linear array beamformer with 4 microphones\n    # with angle 0 degrees and inter mic distance 10 cm\n    R = pra.linear2DArray([2, 1.5], 4, 0, 0.04) \n    room1.addMicrophoneArray(pra.Beamformer(R, room1.fs))\n\n    # Now compute the delay and sum weights for the beamformer\n    room1.micArray.rakeDelayAndSumWeights(room1.sources[0][:1])\n\n    # plot the room and resulting beamformer\n    room1.plot(freq=[1000, 2000, 4000, 8000], img_order=0)\n    plt.show()\n\nAuthors\n-------\n\n* Robin Scheibler\n* Ivan Dokmani\u0107\n* Sidney Barthe\n\nHow to contribute\n-----------------\n\nIf you would like to contribute, please clone the\n`repository <http://github.com/LCAV/pyroomacoustics>`_ and send a pull request.\n\nAcademic publications\n---------------------\n\nThis package was developped to support academic publications.
