    "description": "Zes3t (pronounced \"zest!\") is a Python API to access Amazon's S3 AWS storage service. Unlike many other S3 APIs, zes3t uses the SOAP web services in the background rather than the REST web services. The SOAP client implementation is the excellent \"suds\" project. The zes3t API very closely mirrors Amazon's own API, and is well-documented; it also fully supports the COPY operation.",
