    "description": "Last Train to Nowhere\n=====================\n\nEntry to `PyWeek #15 <http://www.pyweek.org/15/>`_\n\n* Team: Wasabi/Paratha\n* Members: mauve, arnav\n\nYou are an outlaw on the run - and you need to get the hell out of town.\n\nThere's only one problem: the train has already left. Ok, two problems: it is\nalso packed with law men.\n\nOnly one thing to do: load your six-shooter, saddle up, and chase that train\ndown!\n\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nIf you haven't already please install the following dependencies::\n\n    Python 2.7                  (required)\n    Pyglet 1.1.4 or v1.2alpha1  (required)\n    AVBin                       (recommended) for playing music\n\n\nRunning the game\n----------------\n\nOpen a terminal window, \"cd\" into the game directory and run::\n\n    python run_game.py\n\n\nHow to play\n-----------\n\nThe following input keys are used for this game::\n\n    LEFT        move left\n    RIGHT       move right\n    UP          jump\n    DOWN        crouch\n    X           shoot from a distance or punch at close range\n\nThe aim of the game is to progress forward in the train, and collecting all the\ngold bars on the train. The gold bars will be picked up as you touch them.\n\nBut many lawmen are present, guarding the train and the gold. How can you get\npast them?\n\nNote: Press the 'X' key to skip the intro sequence.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nLast Train to Nowhere is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public\nLicense v3.0.",
