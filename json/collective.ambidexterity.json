    "description": "==============================================================================\ncollective.ambidexterity\n==============================================================================\n\ncollective.ambidexterity provides through-the-web editing of views, defaults, validators and vocabularies for Dexterity content types.\n\nStatus of the package\n---------------------\n\ncollective.ambidexterity is in early beta.\nIt is not yet recommended for use in production sites.\n\nThe package currently only works in Plone 5.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nAdd `collective.ambidexterity` to the `eggs` list in your Plone 5 buildout.\nRun buildout.\n\nUse the add/remove addons option in site setup to activate the package for a particular Plone site.\n\nQuick operation\n---------------\n\nLook for the `Ambidexterity` option near the end of site setup.\nThis will open the Ambidexterity editor.\n\nYou should be able to add view templates for all Dexterity content types.\nView templates are standard Plone page templates using TAL for dynamic content.\n\n\nDefault, validator and vocabulary scripts may be added for all Dexterity content types that you have created through-the-web.\nYou may not add default, validator or vocabulary scripts for content types that have been set up via Python packages.\n(Exception: if the content-type's fields are definedd in a `model source` attribute of the FTI, you may add Ambidexterity scripts.)\n\nDefault, validator and vocabulary scripts are much like the Scripts (Python) that may be added via the Zope Management Interface.\nThey will execute in a Restricted Python environment with the privileges of the logged-in user.\nLimited imports are available.\n\nRestricted Python provides a safety net for programmers who don't know the details of the Zope/Plone security model.\nIf you are running up against the limitations of Restricted Python, you should consider migrating your Ambidexterity code to a Python package.\nIt is important that you understand that the safety net is not perfect: it is not adequate to protect your site from coding by an untrusted user.\nOnly highly trusted users should be allowed to use the Ambidexterity editor.\nIt is by default restricted to site managers.\n\nCautions\n--------\n\nThis package marks the `re`, `datetime` and `time` modules as safe for use in RestrictedPython.\nThat will affect all PythonScripts.\n\nTo do\n-----\n\nTest coverage: pretty good for the nuts and bolts.\nThe user interface is currently completely untested.\nIf you're up-to-date on robot testing, your assistance would be appreciated.\n\nDocs: Currently rudimentary, but probably adequate for many knowledgeable users.\n\ni18n: Undeveloped.\n\nAccessibility: Undeveloped.\n\nContribute\n----------\n\n- Issue Tracker: https://github.com/collective/collective.ambidexterity/issues\n- Source Code: https://github.com/collective/collective.ambidexterity\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nPlone community forums: https://community.plone.org/\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThe project is licensed under the GPLv2.\n\n\nContributors\n============\n\n- Steve McMahon, steve@dcn.org\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n\n1.0b2 (2017-10-02)\n------------------\n\n- The editor would sometimes fail to list any content types. Fixed.\n  [smcmahon]\n\n- Most operations would not work on sites that didn't have an id of 'Plone'. Fixed.\n  Thanks, Wayne Glover.\n  [smcmahon]\n\n\n1.0b1 (2017-09-27)\n------------------\n\n- Initial release.\n  [smcmahon]",
