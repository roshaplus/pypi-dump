    "description": "*instawow* is a fledgling package manager for World of Warcraft written\nin Python. It can be used to install, remove and update add-ons from\nCurse and WoWInterface.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nAssuming you have Python 3.6 or higher::\n\n    pip3 install instawow\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nInstalling add-ons\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can install add-ons by their Curse project|nbsp|ID or slug, or their\nWoWInterface|nbsp|ID, or even by their URL. All of the following will install\nMolinari::\n\n    instawow install curse:20338\n    instawow install curse:molinari\n    instawow install https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/molinari\n    instawow install https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/molinari\n    instawow install wowi:13188\n    instawow install https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info13188-Molinari.html\n\nBy default *instawow* will install the latest file to have been\nofficially published. You may also install the latest file to have been\nuploaded (on the CurseForge or WowAce), be it stable, or beta or alpha\nquality, by passing ``--strategy=latest``.\n\nConfiguring add-ons\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can opt into alpha updates anytime with\n``instawow set --strategy=latest <add-on>`` and revert to receiving\nstable updates with ``instawow set --strategy=canonical <add-on>``.\n\nUpdating\n~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can update all of your add-ons in one go with ``instawow update`` or\nany individual add-on the same way you'd install or remove it:\n``instawow update <add-on>``.\n\nUninstalling\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nUninstalling an add-on is as simple as ``instawow remove <add-on>``.\n\nOther operations\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou may list installed add-ons with ``instawow list installed``;\noutdated add-ons with ``instawow list outdated``; and pre-existing\nadd-ons with ``instawow list preexisting``. The latter command will\nattempt to reconcile add-on folders with their corresponding Curse IDs,\nwhere available.\n\nTo see information about an installed add-on, execute\n``instawow info <add-on>``. To visit its homepage, execute\n``instawow hearth <add-on>``. And to open its main folder in your file\nmanager, run ``instawow reveal <add-on>``.\n\nExtras\n------\n\n*instawow* ships with a\n`BitBar <https://getbitbar.com/>`__ plug-in for macOS.\nTo install it run ``instawow extras bitbar install``.\n\nCaveats\n-------\n\nAuto-detection\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n*instawow* will only manage add-ons it itself installed\nbecause it has no registry from which to derive add-on fingerprings.\nThe Twitch (n\u00e9e Curse) client uses a proprietary fingerprinting algo\nthat nobody (that I know) has been able to figure out how is calculated.\nEven if the fingerprint had been reverse-engineered, I'd be loath to adopt it.\nThe fingerprint was born of a desire to monopolise the add-on distribution\nmarket \u2013 or it would've been made a community standard. WoWI's Minion app\nimplements a similar though less sophisticated fingerprinting algo.\n\nMetadata freshness\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Twitch client uses a closed metadata API internally.\nBecause the API was not built for third-party use it has not been\nisolated from user accounts (cf. GitHub integrations).\nIf users were to log into the API *instawow* would acquire full\naccess to their account. Authentication is also complicated\nby the ongoing Curse account migration to Twitch and is (or should be)\nunnecessary for the simple use case of installing and updating add-ons.\nInstead, *instawow* relies solely on official data dumps or 'feeds'.\nThis approach is not without its drawbacks:\n\n- There are sometimes gaps in the Curse feeds with multiple add-ons\n  being lost in the Twisting Nether until they invariably reappear\n  a few hours later, ostensibly unharmed.\n\n- The feeds are updated at least once hourly.\n  Therefore you might receive add-on updates with up to an hour's delay\n  depending on the \u0394t between a new file being uploaded and the feed\n  being updated.\n\nBy contrast Minion uses an undocumented but open JSON API, which\n*instawow* does communicate with.\n\nBecause it has a much shorter execution cycle than a desktop app,\n*instawow* caches add-on metadata for one hour. If you do for whatever\nreason need to force an early resync you can do so with\n``instawow debug cache invalidate``.\n\nDiscovery\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n*instawow* aims to facilitate add-on management and not discovery. It\ndoes not seek to drive users away from add-on portals; but to make\ninstalling, updating and removing add-ons found on portals hassle-free\nfor those of us who are (ever so slightly) proficient with the command\nline and do not particularly relish in using bloatware or inhabiting\nwalled gardens.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nFork and clone the `repo <https://github.com/layday/instawow>`__, ``cd``\nand::\n\n    python3 -m venv venv\n    source venv/bin/active\n    python3 -m pip install -e .\n\nHappy hacking.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nBug reports and fixes are welcome. Do open an issue before committing to\nmaking any significant changes.\n\n\n.. |nbsp| unicode:: 0xA0",
