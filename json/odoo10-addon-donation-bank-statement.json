Then, on the company, you must select\nthis journal as the *Donations via Credit Transfer Journal*.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo use the module, you should import your bank statement as usual.\nDuring the reconciliation step, when you have a donation by credit\ntransfer, you should set the account that you used as default\ndebit/credit account on the journal dedicated for donations via credit\ntransfer. Once your bank statement is closed, you should click on the\nbutton *Create Donations*, which will create draft donations linked\nto the related bank statement line. When these draft donations are\nvalidated, it will create the corresponding account move and reconcile\nit with the account move of the bank statement.\n\nHint: for a faster processing of the bank statement, you can create a *Statement Operation Template* dedicated to the Donations via Credit Transfer in the menu Accounting > Configuration > Miscellaneous > Statement Operation Template. This statement operation template will be configured with the account corresponding to the donations via credit transfer.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/180/10.0\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/donation/issues>`_.
