    "description": "This is PyTopo, an application for exploring tiled maps cached locally.\n\nSee the project home page at http://shallowsky.com/software/topo\nfor more information, examples, screenshots, hints on creating\ncustom maps, and more.\n\nIt can download data from OpenStreetMap or other map servers,\nwhich may or may not require API keys; or you can use tiles from\ncommercial programs like the Topo! or tiles you've generated yourself.\n\nIt can also display GPX, KML or KMZ track logs, and can measure\ndistances and angles between points or give you the coordinates of\na point.\n\nIt uses PyGTK for its user interface, so you will need to PyGTK.\nLinux users can get it through their distro, or by compiling from source;\nWindows users can install it from pip. I don't have a good answer for\nMac users; possibly the easiest solution is to install GIMP (follow\nthe install links from https://gimp.org) then munge paths so that\nother programs can find the PyGTK that comes with GIMP.\n\nYou can install it with pip install pytopo.\nOr run it from the project directory by running pytopo/MapViewer.py\nif you have the pytopo directory in your PYTHONPATH.\nBut if you want to see pin images, create a directory\n/usr/share/pytopo and copy pytopo-pin.png into it.\nOr just have pytopo-pin.png in the current directory when you run pytopo.\n\nThe first time you run it, pytopo will create a ~/.config/pytopo\ndirectory for its configuration files, and a Maps directory for\nmap data.\n\npytopo -h gives usage examples.\n\nIf you need custom maps., edit ~/.config/pytopo/pytopo.sites to add new\nmap Collections (see examples in that file or on the project home page).\n\nCode contributions appreciated!\n\nAlso in this project: ellie, a little script for reporting and plotting\nstatistics (distance and elevation change) read from a GPX track log.\nMore information: http://shallowsky.com/software/ellie/\n\nHave fun!",
