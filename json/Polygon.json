    "description": "THIS VERSION WORKS WITH PYTHON-3.x ONLY!\n\nPolygon is a python package that handles polygonal shapes in 2D. It contains \nPython bindings for gpc, the excellent General Polygon Clipping Library by \nAlan Murta and some extensions written in C and pure Python. With Polygon you \nmay handle complex polygonal shapes in Python in a very intuitive way. Polygons \nare simple Python objects, clipping operations are bound to standard operators \nlike +, -, \\|, & and ^. TriStrips can be constructed from Polygons with a \nsingle statement. Functions to compute the area, center point, convex hull,\npoint containment and much more are included. This package was already used to\nprocess shapes with more than one million points!\n\nThe gpc homepage is located at http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~toby/alan/software/ .\n\nThe wrapping and extension code is free software, but the core gpc library is\nfree for non-commercial usage only. The author says:\n\n    GPC is free for non-commercial use only. We invite non-commercial users \n    to make a voluntary donation towards the upkeep of GPC.\n    \n    If you wish to use GPC in support of a commercial product, you must obtain \n    an official GPC Commercial Use Licence from The University of Manchester.\n\nPlease respect this statement and contact the author (see gpc homepage) if you\nwish to use this software in commercial projects!",
