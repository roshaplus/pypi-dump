    "description": "=================\nORCycle README\n=================\n\n.. contents::\n\nAbout\n=========\n\n:Version:\n   0.1\n:Author:\n   Momar Hughes\n:Contact:\n   momar.hughes@unsw.edu.au\n:Topic:\n   Thermodynamic heat cycle sizing and analysis\n:Licence:\n   MIT\n:Requires:\n   numpy, scipy, matplotlib, CoolProp\n\n\nORCycle is a Python3 module for 1-dimensional analysis and sizing of thermodynamic heat cycles, particularly the organic Rankine cycle. Sizing methods are based on empirical and theoretical correlations. Users may analyse cycles consisting of components including heaters, coolers, compressors, expanders and heat exchangers. The two main modes for analysing cycles or components are:\n\n* *solve* : calculates a component characteristic/dimension required to satisfy a desired component outlet flow state/cycle flow states. This mode is used for sizing components.\n\n* *run* : calculates working fluid cycle flow states/ component outlet flow state based on user-defined characteristics/dimensions of the components.\n\nThe Github project page can be found at `http://github.com/momargoh/ORCycle <http://github.com/momargoh/ORCycle>`_. The documentation is hosted at `https://orcycle.readthedocs.io <https://orcycle.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nRequirements::\n\n  sudo apt install build-essential python3 python3-dev python3-pip python3-tk cython3 git\n  pip3 install numpy\n  pip3 install scipy\n  pip3 install matplotlib\n\nORCycle also requires `CoolProp  <http://www.coolprop.org>`_, a free and open-source thermodynamic properties library. It is recommended to manually install the latest version of CoolProp before installing ORCycle (rather than installing from pip which is not the latest version). Refer to their `guide on manual installation <http://www.coolprop.org/coolprop/wrappers/Python/index.html#manual-installation>`_, summarised below.::\n\n  cd PATH/TO/CLONE/FOLDER\n  git clone https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp.git --recursive  \n  cd wrappers/Python\n  sudo python3 setup.py install\n\nORCycle should now be ready to be installed. For the latest updates, clone/download the source code from the `Github page <https://github.com/momargoh/ORCycle>`_ and run::\n\n  python3 setup.py install\n\nFor the latest stable release, ORCycle is available from pip by running:: \n\n  pip3 install orcycle\n\nORCycle is available under the MIT licence, hence free for everybody to use and edit. \n\nContributions towards the project source code will be gratefully received. Feel free to contact the author via email or GitHub with any queries.\n\nQuick start\n===========\n\nHave a look through ``orcycle/examples`` to get a feel for how to use the module (`link to documentaion <https://orcycle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/examples.html>`_). These examples can be easily copied to your local directory and modified to get you started.\n\n\nNotes on installing CoolProp from source for Python3\n=====================================================\n\nOnce, the installation failed because /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages did not exist, thus I ran::\n\n  sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages\n\nAnother time, I had to rename the original cloned CoolProp folder to stop Python3 finding it when importing::\n\n  sudo mv PATH/TO/CLONE/FOLDER/CoolProp PATH/TO/CLONE/FOLDER/_CoolProp-master\n\n\n\n",
