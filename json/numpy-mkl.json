    "description": "NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package designed to\r\nefficiently manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays of arbitrary\r\nrecords without sacrificing too much speed for small multi-dimensional\r\narrays.  NumPy is built on the Numeric code base and adds features\r\nintroduced by numarray as well as an extended C-API and the ability to\r\ncreate arrays of arbitrary type which also makes NumPy suitable for\r\ninterfacing with general-purpose data-base applications.\r\n\r\nThere are also basic facilities for discrete fourier transform,\r\nbasic linear algebra and random number generation.",
