Unfortunately with changes to the v8 search view handling of functional many2one's\nand the deprecation of fields.Dummy this was not easily portable however it is desired to find a more elegant way\nof doing this in future.  It might be possible by converting pricelist_id to a related field of a partner field and\nremoving pricelist from the search view.\n* It has previously been requested that this support supplier pricelists as well, however there are certain difficulties\nwith that approach, not least of which is one supplier rarely supplies all products making displayed prices meaningless.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/product-attribute/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed feedback\n`here <https://github.com/OCA/product-attribute/issues/new?body=module:%20customer_product_pricing_button%0Aversion:%208.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n* Graeme Gellatly <g@o4sb.com>\n\nMaintainer\n----------\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nTo contribute to this module, please visit http://odoo-community.org.",
