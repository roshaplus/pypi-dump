    "description": "FileHasher\n----------\n\nThe purpose of this tool is to allow you to get a list of hashes of the\nfiles of some directories, compare those lists and generate a script\nwith commands to equalize those directories.\n\nFor instance, if you have two directories that were the same but on one\nof them you renamed files, or even moved some to other directories, with\nthis tool you can get a script that allows you to make the second directory\nlook again like the first one.\n\n\nFirst Time Usage\n----------------\n\n1. Install \"filehasher\" to your two (or more) machines. \n   The 'source' and 'destination'.\n\n   % pip install filehasher\n\n\n2. Generate hashes in the two collections\n\n   [user@source /directory] % filehasher -g .orig-hashes\n   [user@destination /directory] % filehasher -g .dest-hashes\n\n\n3. Copy the orig-hashes to _destination_ machine.\n\n    [user@source] % scp .orig-hashes user@destination:directory\n\n\n4. Compare the hashes\n\n    [user@destination] % filehasher -c .dest-hashes .orig-hashes\n\n   This will tell you a lot of things, which files have changed, which files\n   are missing from one list of files, etc. and will create a script called\n   \"filehasher_script.sh\" that you have to edit and run.\n\n\n5. Edit the file \"filehasher_script.sh\"\n\n   At the beginning are the mkdir's needed. After that the mv's needed to make\n   the 'destination' file set equal to 'source' file set.\n\n   After that you will see rmdir's of directories that now can be empty. Maybe \n   they are not empty, you will have to check manually, or uncomment them, if\n   they are not empty anyways they will don't be removed (rmdir will raise an\n   error).\n\n   After the rmdir's you can see a lot of rm's commented. Now you will have to\n   use your text editing skills. This is a list of duplicated files. You have\n   to uncomment the line of the rm of the file that you don't want to keep.\n\n\n6. Run the modified script file\n\n   After this you will have a very similar directory in 'destination' compared\n   to 'source'. In my own experience, it's better to run a second time so you\n   can check any smaller differences with more time.\n\nUse FileHasher as a dupe finder\n-------------------------------\n\nI've found accidentally that you can generate the hashes and run the check\nagainst the same file to found which files are duplicated on your directory.\n\n1. Update the hashes file\n\n   % filehasher -u \n\n   % filehasher -c .hashes .hashes\n\n\n2. Check the file filehasher_script.sh to see the repeated files and \n   uncomment the remove statements to clean your directories.\n   \n\nHistory\n-------\n\nI have a large multimedia collection of pictures/videos of my family, \ntravel, etc.\n\nI also have those files in a hosting, published with a media album \n(that I'm developing, also).\n\nThe need for \"filehasher\" started when I started organizing my\nmedia album and renamed a set of directories and files. Then realized\nthat those files were already uploaded and with the tools I had I will\nneed to upload all the files again to have my remote media album in sync!\n\nAs my upload bandwidth was very limited (512Kbps), the time I should\nhave spent to reupload those files was near two months 24hs!\n\nWith this tool, I synchronized my changes in less than 15 minutes.\n\nFor the file copying to remote location I use rsync, and I think is the\nbest tool, unless you rename files :)\n\n\nCredits/Thanks\n--------------\n\n- When I started this project there were a lot of things that I didn't know\n  how to do, so I want to thanks Internet and Google for helping me out :)\n\n- @CMAD, that made me realize what I really need! Thanks!\n\n- My great girlfriend @rocioar. I love you Ro! :)\n\n- @pablohoffman for giving me hints to improve my code.\n",
