    "description": "TouRSSt tours the web so you don't have to. Run frequently, it pulls\nnew RSS news items from a number of channels and puts them where you\nwant.\n\nCurrently it can deliver news items to a Maildir, but future additions\nwill include sending over SMTP, perhaps writing out aggregated RSS\nfeeds, and so on. TouRSSt is built to be reasonably modular, so you\nshould have no problems adding your own delivery plugin, if you just\nknow a bit of Python.",
