    "description": "CobraBabel: COBRA Model Translator\n==================================\n\nMetabolic models are available from many sources and different sources use different ID namespaces. That makes\ncombining and comparing models from different sources difficult. CobraBabel provides functions to translate\nbetween ID namespaces and convert metabolic models to a common ID namespace. CobraBabel supports the\nfollowing namespaces:\n\n1. `ModelSEED <http://modelseed.org>`_\n2. `Virtual Metabolic Human <http://vmh.uni.lu/>`_ (VMH)\n3. `Biochemical, Genetic and Genomic knowledge base <http://bigg.ucsd.edu/>`_ (BiGG)\n4. `MetaNetX <http://www.metanetx.org/>`_\n5. `Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes <http://www.kegg.jp>`_ (KEGG)\n\nFeatures include:\n\n1. Take a list of models, open all of them, create a universal model with all unique reactions and metabolites.\n2. Download specific files, can get the whole BiGG database, VMH mapping file, MetaNetX translation file.\n3. Function to convert compartment suffixes.\n4. Import from a Excel file or csv file.\n5. ID match without special characters\n\nVMH Notes\n^^^^^^^^^\n\nVMH provides a SEED2VMH_translation.csv file which is not current with the translation table\nin Supplementary Table 15 in the AGORA paper. Supplementary Table 15 is provided as an\nExcel workbook which was parsed into two files: (1) vmh_metabolite_xref.tsv and\n(2) vmh_reaction_xref.tsv which are provided in the \"data\" folder.\n\nBiGG Notes\n^^^^^^^^^^\n\nUniversal metabolites can have more than one formula if different models use a different formula\nfor a metabolite with the same ID (same situation can occur with charge). Currently, CobraBabel blindly\npicks the first formula in the list of formulae for a universal metabolite.\n\nUniversal metabolites have a list of all the compartments where the metabolite is used. Currently,\nCobraBabel assumes that all compartment IDs are defined the same across all models. For example, compartment\nID \"c\" means \"cytosol\" in all BiGG models. The first instance of the compartment in a metabolite is the one\nthat sets the name.\n\nMetaNetX Notes\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nSome reactions are defined with unspecified stoichiometry coefficients, for example:\n`(2n) MNXM1471 + 1 MNXM3341 = (2n) MNXM1 + 1 MNXM4074 + (2n) MNXM537`. Currently, CobraBabel\ndoes not include these reactions when creating an universal model.\n\nThere are some reactions where there is a BIOMASS metabolite in the reaction definition.\nBut the BIOMASS metabolite is not defined so any reactions with the BIOMASS metabolite are\nnot included in the universal model.\n\nIf a reaction has a value in the Source field, there is only one source in the format:\n`source:id`. Sources include Rhea (rhea), KEGG (kegg), MetaCyc (metacyc), UniPathway (upa),\nThe Seed (seed), BiGG (bigg), BioPath (biopath), and Reactome (reactome). Set the `verbose`\nparameter when calling `create_metanetx_universal_model()` to show a warning for reactions with\nan invalid format in the Source field.\n\nThere are no compartments so metabolites are defined without a compartment. Still not sure\nhow exchange and transport reactions are defined.\n\nAll reactions are defined as bi-directional so the lower and upper bounds are set to the\ndefault values `(-1000.0, 1000.0)` for all reactions.\n\nKEGG Notes\n^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThere are some limitations on the `KEGG API <http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/rest/>`_, most importantly:\n\n**Restrictions:** KEGG API is provided for academic use by academic users belonging to academic\ninstitutions. This service should not be used for bulk data downloads. Please obtain KEGG FTP\nacademic subscription for downloading KEGG data.\n\nWhen setting OTU representatives in the organism database, there can be variability in which\norganism is selected when there are multiple good matches. For example, in the KEGG database\nthere are two Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv organisms, one with ID \"T00015\" and one with ID\n\"T02178\". It is random as to which one gets picked as the OTU representative.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nBiGG\n\nMetaNetX.org: a website and repository for accessing, analyzing and manipulating metabolic networks.\nBioinformatics (2013)\n\nVMH",
