    "description": "Great Circle Maps for Python\n============================\n\nThis is a Python rewrite of the code used to create the `Visualizing Facebook Friends <http://fbmap.bitaesthetics.com/>`__ visualization in 2010.\n\nThe original code was written in R and was built specifically around the Facebook dataset. This rewrite is as a Python module and is built to work on top of any dataset.\n\nIf you are looking to visualize a few (<10,000) coordinate pairs, `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`__ with `basemap <http://matplotlib.org/basemap/>`__ will be more flexible. The visualization\nimplemented by this module is useful when the data alone are sufficient to show the geography.\n\nThe algorithm uses a heuristic which attempts to visualize the *structure* of the pairs rather than their relative importance. In interpreting the results, you should not come to any conclusions about the relative importance of different coordinate pairs.\n\nThe `OpenFlights dataset <http://openflights.org/data.html>`__ visualized with ``gcmap``:\n\n.. image:: https://raw.github.com/paulgb/gcmap/master/example.png\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can install ``gcmap`` with ``pip``::\n\n    # pip install gcmap\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe module supplies two classes, ``GCMapper`` and ``Gradient``. ``GCMapper`` is the main class for rendering great-circle maps. ``Gradient`` is used when you would like to customize the color gradient\nused to render the map.\n\n``GCmapper``\n------------\n\nFirst, import GCMapper and instantiate it::\n\n    >>> from gcmap import GCMapper\n    >>> gcm = GCMapper()\n\nThe ``GCMapper()`` constructor can take a number of arguments:\n\n* ``width`` the height of the output image\n* ``height`` the width of the output image; defaults to half the width, which fits the world completely for the default projection (equidistant cylindrical)\n* ``bgcol`` the background color as an (r, g, b) triple, eg. (255, 0, 0) for red\n* ``cols`` a ``Gradient`` object or other function from a fraction an (r, g, b) triple\n* ``proj`` the projection to use as a string, passed to pyproj. See `pyproj <http://pyproj.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/pyproj-pysrc.html>`__ for a list of projections\n* ``line_width`` the width of the lines draw, in pixels\n* ``gc_resolution`` the number of straight line segments used to approximate each great-circle curve\n\nNormally you would load the coordinate pairs from a file. For this example I'll simply code in the\ndata::\n\n    >>> lons1 = [-79.4, -73.9, -122.4, -123.1, -0.1  ]\n    >>> lats1 = [ 43.7,  40.7,   37.8,   49.2,  51.5 ]\n    >>> lons2 = lons1[1:] + lons1[:1]    # this creates a cycle through the points\n    >>> lats2 = lats1[1:] + lats1[:1]\n\nThe data can also be a numpy array.\n\nThen, give the data to the ``GCMapper`` instance::\n\n    >>> gcm.set_data(lons1, lats1, lons2, lats2)\n\nNow, we can generate the image::\n\n    >>> img = gcm.draw()\n\n``img`` is just a Python Image Library Image object, which we can save in any supported\nformat::\n\n    >>> img.save('output.png')\n\n``Gradient``\n------------\n\nGradients are instantiated with one parameter, a list of two or more gradient \"stops\". Stops\nare RGB colors located at a fractional position along the gradient. The color at any point\non the gradient is a weighted blend of the stops nearest to that point in either direction.\n\nFor example, let's define a gradient from white to red to black::\n\n    >>> from gcmap import Gradient\n    >>> #             (stop,   red, green,  blue)\n    >>> g = Gradient([(   0,   255,   255,   255),\n    ...               ( 0.4,   255,     0,     0),\n    ...               (   1,     0,     0,     0)])\n\nNote that red the stop is at 0.4, or four tenths of the gradient.\n\nThe gradient ``g`` now acts as a function when it is called. When it is called with a\nstop which was explicitly specified at construction, it returns the (r, g, b) triple\nat that stop::\n\n    >>> g(0)\n    (255, 255, 255)\n    >>> g(0.4)\n    (255, 0, 0)\n    >>> g(1)\n    (0, 0, 0)\n\nWhen ``g`` is called with fractions that are not stops, it blends the nearest stops in\neither direction to create a new color::\n\n    >>> g(0.1)\n    (255, 191, 191)\n    >>> g(0.2)\n    (255, 127, 127)\n    >>> g(0.3)\n    (255, 63, 63)\n    >>> g(0.5)\n    (212, 0, 0)\n    >>> g(0.6)\n    (170, 0, 0)\n    >>> g(0.7)\n    (127, 0, 0)\n    >>> g(0.8)\n    (84, 0, 0)\n    >>> g(0.9)\n    (42, 0, 0)\n\nLicense\n-------\n`zlib-style <http://www.gzip.org/zlib/zlib_license.html>`__ as follows:\n\nCopyright (C) 2013 Paul Butler\n\nThis software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied\nwarranty.
