    "description": "******************************************\nSimple-history: History for Django Models\n******************************************\n\ndjango-simple-history is a tool to store state of DB objects on every create/update/delete. It has been tested to work in django 1.X (including 1.4 as of 08/30/2011).\n\n**Install**\n\nDownload the tar.gz, extract it and run the following inside the directory:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    python setup.py install\n\n**Basic usage**\n\nUsing this package is *really* simple; you just have to ``import HistoricalRecords`` and create an instance of it on every model you want to historically track.\n\nAppend the following line you your ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``\n\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (\n      'simple_history.middleware.CurrentUserMiddleware',\n      )\n\nOn your models you need to include the following line at the top:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from simple_history.models import HistoricalRecords\n\n\nThen in your model class, include the following line:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    history = HistoricalRecords()\n\n\nThen from either the model class or from an instance, you can access ``history.all()`` which will give you either every history item of the class, or every history item of the specific instance.\n\n**Example**\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    class Poll(models.Model):\n        question = models.CharField(max_length = 200)\n        pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')\n\n        history = HistoricalRecords()\n\n    class Choice(models.Model):\n        poll = models.ForeignKey(Poll)\n        choice = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n        votes = models.IntegerField()\n\n        history = HistoricalRecords()\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ ./manage.py shell\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    In [2]: from poll.models import Poll, Choice\n\n    In [3]: Poll.objects.all()\n    Out[3]: []\n\n    In [4]: import datetime\n\n    In [5]: p = Poll(question=\"what's up?\", pub_date=datetime.datetime.now())\n\n    In [6]: p.save()\n\n    In [7]: p\n    Out[7]: <Poll: Poll object>\n\n    In [9]: p.history.all()\n    Out[9]: [<HistoricalPoll: Poll object as of 2010-10-25 18:03:29.855689>]\n\n    In [10]: p.pub_date = datetime.datetime(2007,4,1,0,0)\n\n    In [11]: p.save()\n\n    In [13]: p.history.all()\n    Out[13]: [<HistoricalPoll: Poll object as of 2010-10-25 18:04:13.814128>, <HistoricalPoll: Poll object as of 2010-10-25 18:03:29.855689>]\n\n    In [14]: p.choice_set.create(choice='Not Much', votes=0)\n    Out[14]: <Choice: Choice object>\n\n    In [15]: p.choice_set.create(choice='The sky', votes=0)\n    Out[15]: <Choice: Choice object>\n\n    In [16]: c = p.choice_set.create(choice='Just hacking again', votes=0)\n\n    In [17]: c.poll\n    Out[17]: <Poll: Poll object>\n\n    In [19]: c.history.all()\n    Out[19]: [<HistoricalChoice: Choice object as of 2010-10-25 18:05:30.160595>]\n\n    In [20]: Choice.history\n    Out[20]: <simple_history.manager.HistoryManager object at 0x1cc4290>\n\n    In [21]: Choice.history.all()\n    Out[21]: [<HistoricalChoice: Choice object as of 2010-10-25 18:05:30.160595>, <HistoricalChoice: Choice object as of 2010-10-25 18:05:12.183340>, <HistoricalChoice: Choice object as of 2010-10-25 18:04:59.047351>]\n\n**Copyright and license**\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2013 Pivotal Energy Solutions.
