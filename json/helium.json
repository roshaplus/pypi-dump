    "description": "Helium is a library that wraps around Selenium to offer a more intuitive API for web automation. Its crucial property is that it allows you to identify web elements by user-visible labels instead of HTML ids, CSS selectors or XPaths. This results in a reduction of web automation script size by 50%, on average.",
