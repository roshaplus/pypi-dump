    "description": "Snowballing\n===========\n\nThis project provides tools for perfoming a liberature review through\nsnowballing. It includes Jupyter Notebook widgets that assist the\nbackward and forward steps of literature snowballing, notebooks that\nassist in inserting citations in the database, and notebooks for\nanalyzing the snowballing and producing citation graphs, publication\nplace histograms, and a summarization of the snowballing steps.\n\nThis package was tested on Python 3.6 using Windows, but it should\nsupport Python > 3.5 in any operating system. Please, open an issue if\nit is not the case.\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\nTo install the tool, you should follow these instructions:\n\n-  First, install the python package:\n-  ``$ pip install snowballing``\n\n-  Then, download and install the latest\n   `geckodriver <https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases>`__\n-  In my case, I put the 'geckodriver.exe' file in the Firefox directory\n   (``C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mozilla Firefox``)\n-  And I add the directory to the PATH environment variable\n\n-  If you want to export the snowballing history (provenance), you must\n   also install the following tools\n-  `provtoolbox <http://lucmoreau.github.io/ProvToolbox/>`__\n-  `GraphViz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`__\n\nFor starting a new literature review project, please run:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ snowballing start literature\n\nThis command will create a directory called ``literature`` (you are free\nto use other name in the command) with the notebooks for performing the\nsnowballing and analyzing it, and an example database.\n\nInside the directory, start Jupyter:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ cd literature\n    $ jupyter notebook\n\nAnd open the file `Index.ipynb <example/Index.ipynb>`__. This file\ncontains all the instructions for understanding the database and\nperforming the snowballing.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nFeel free to contribute to the project!\n\nFor installing in development mode, clone the repository and use\n``pip install -e``:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ git clone git@github.com:JoaoFelipe/snowballing.git\n    $ cd snowballing\n    $ pip install -e snowballing\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis project started as part of a literature snowballing. The tools were\ndevelopped out of necessity in a adhoc way. Thus, it has some bad design\ndecisions, such as using Python scripts as a database, and choosing\nfield names that are far from ideal.\n\nContributions to fix these and other issues are welcome! If you are\ngoing to change a field name that is used by the tool, please, try to\nmake it configurable.\n\nContact\n-------\n\nDo not hesitate to contact me:\n\n-  Jo\u00e3o Felipe Pimentel joaofelipenp@gmail.com\n\nLicense Terms\n-------------\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n\n",
