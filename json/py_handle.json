    "description": "PYHANDLE\n========\n\nPyHandle is a Python client library for interaction with a `Handle\nSystem <https://handle.net>`__ server, providing basic create, read,\nupdate and delete capabilities for Handles. The library offers a client\nfor the HTTP REST interface, a client that interacts directly with a\nHandle server SQL back-end and a client that creates customized Batch\nfiles. The latter contain Batch operations, that can be performed using\nthe GenericBatch command utility provided by the Handle System.\n\nPyHandle currently supports Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.5, and requires at\nleast a Handle System server 8.1. The library requires OpenSSL v1.0.1 or\nhigher.\n\nPyHandle is based on a prior development of the `EUDAT\nproject <https://eudat.eu>`__ under the name B2Handle. As\n`B2Handle <https://github.com/EUDAT-B2SAFE/B2HANDLE>`__ was developed\nwith a specific scope - Handle operations in the EUDAT project - in\nmind, it has been improved and made more generic to cater to a broader\naudience.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nYou can install the PyHandle library as follows:\n\n1. git clone https://github.com/EUDAT-B2SAFE/PYHANDLE.git\n2. cd PYHANDLE/\n3. python setup.py install\n\nThe library is also available on PyPi and can be installed via pip:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n     pip install py_handle\n\nBuilding the documentation\n==========================\n\nFor more details about the library you can build the documention using\n`Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`__, requiring at least version 1.3.\nSphinx and can be installed via pip. To build HTML documentation\nlocally, then run:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    python setup.py build_sphinx\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nCopyright 2015-2017, Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum GmbH, GRNET S.A.,\nSURFsara\n\nThe PYHANDLE library is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0\n(the \"License\"); you may not use this product except in compliance with\nthe License.
