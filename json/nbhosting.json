    "description": "# notebook hosting architecture\n\nThis git repo contains a collection of utilities, that together make up the architecture behind `nbhosting.inria.fr` that is designed as a notebook-serving infrastructure.\n\nFirst use case is for hosting notebooks in the context of MOOCs. See e.g.\n\n* [Python : des fondamentaux \u00e0 l'utilisation du langage on fun-mooc.fr](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/courses/inria/41001S03/session03/about)\n* [Bioinformatique : algorithmes et g\u00e9nomes on fun-mooc.fr](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/courses/inria/41003S02/session02/about)\n\n# *Open-edX* teacher side\n\nOn the edx side, teacher would create a bloc typed as *ipython notebook* - note that the present repo does not address the code for the edx extension that supports this type of blocs (ref?); it is reaily available at this point (jan. 2017) at `fun-mooc.fr`.\n\n![](doc/edx-bloc.png)\n\n![](doc/edx-notebook.png)\n\n![](doc/edx-details.png)\n\n# *Open-edX* student side\n\nHere's what a student would see; \n\n![](doc/edx-student.png)\n\n# `nbhosting` side\n\nHere's the general principle of how of works\n\n* Open-edX forges a URL, like the one shown above, with `student` replaced with the hash of some student id\n* This is caught by nginx, that runs forefront; the `ipythonExercice/` prefix is routed to a django application, that primarily does this\n  * create a linux user if needed\n  * create a copy of that notebook for the student if needed\n  * spawns a (docker) jupyter instance for the couple (course, student)\n  * redirects to a (plain https, on port 443) URL that contains the (http/localhost) port number that the docker instance can be reached at\n \nAs a summary:\n\n![](doc/architecture.png)\n\n\n# TODO\n\nA lot remains to be done, incuding using github's issues for tracking what remains to be done ;)\nFor now see [doc/TODO-nbhosting.md](doc/TODO-nbhosting.md)\n\n",
