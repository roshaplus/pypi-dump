    "description": ".. -*- mode: rst -*-\n\ncoremltools\n===========\n\n`Core ML <http://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml>`_\nis an Apple framework which allows developers to simply and easily integrate\nmachine learning (ML) models into apps running on Apple devices (including iOS,\nwatchOS, macOS, and tvOS).  Core ML introduces a public file format (.mlmodel)\nfor a broad set of ML methods including deep neural networks (both\nconvolutional and recurrent), tree ensembles with boosting, and generalized\nlinear models. Models in this format can be directly integrated into apps\nthrough Xcode.\n\ncoremltools in a python package for creating, examining, and testing models in\nthe .mlmodel format.  In particular, it can be used to:\n\n- Convert existing models to .mlmodel format from popular machine learning tools including Keras, Caffe, scikit-learn, libsvm, and XGBoost.\n- Express models in .mlmodel format through a simple API.\n- Make predictions with an .mlmodel (on select platforms for testing purposes).\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe method for installing :code:`coremltools` follows the\n`standard python package installation steps <https://packaging.python.org/installing/>`_.\nOnce you have set up a python environment, run::\n\n    pip install -U coremltools\n\nThe package `documentation\n<https://docs-assets-developer.corp.apple.com/coreml/documentation/coremltools_documentation.zip>`_\ncontains more details on how to use coremltools.\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\n:code:`coremltools` has the following dependencies:\n\n- numpy (1.12.1+)\n- protobuf (3.1.0+)\n\nIn addition, it has the following soft dependencies that are only needed when\nyou are converting models of these formats:\n\n- Keras (==1.2.2) with Tensorflow (1.0.x, 1.1.x)\n- Xgboost (0.6+)\n- scikit-learn (0.15+)\n- libSVM\n\nMore Information\n----------------\n\n- `Core ML framework documentation <http://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml>`_\n- `Download coremltools documentation <https://docs-assets-developer.corp.apple.com/coreml/documentation/coremltools_documentation.zip>`_\n- `Download Core ML model specification <https://docs-assets-developer.corp.apple.com/coreml/documentation/mlmodel_specification.zip>`_\n- `Machine learning at Apple <https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning>`_\n\nLicense\n-------\nCopyright (c) 2017, Apple Inc.
