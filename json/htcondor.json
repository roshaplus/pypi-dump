    "description": "The HTCondor Python Bindings\n============================\n\nThe HTCondor python modules aim to expose a high-quality, Pythonic interface to the HTCondor client libraries. They utilize the same C++ libraries as HTCondor itself, meaning they have nearly the same behavior as the command line tools.\n\nSee https://htcondor-python.readthedocs.io",
