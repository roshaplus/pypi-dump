    "description": "pySlip\r\n======\r\n\r\npySlip is a 'slip map' widget for wxPython.\r\n\r\nDuring my work writing geophysical applications in python I often wanted to display a map that was very large - many hundreds of thousands of pixels in width.  I searched around for a GUI solution that would work rather like Google maps: tiled, layers, etc.  I couldn't find anything that didn't assume browser+map server.  So I wrote my own wxPython widget.  This worked well for cartesian self-generated maps and has been extended to handle non-cartesian maps and tiles sourced from places like OpenStreetMap.\r\n\r\nIt's a poor thing, but solves my problem.  I'm placing it here in the hope that someone else may find it useful.  If you find it useful, or make improvements to it, drop me a line.\r\n\r\npySlip works on Linux, Mac and Windows.  It only works with wxPython 2.x and Python 2.x (at the moment).  At some point when wxPython matures I hope to move to Python 3.X and later versions of wxPython.\r\n\r\nThe widget API is in the `GitHub wiki  <https://github.com/rzzzwilson/pySlip/wiki/The-pySlip-API>`_.\r\n\r\nThe older version on Google code (https://code.google.com/p/pyslip) is no longer maintained.",
