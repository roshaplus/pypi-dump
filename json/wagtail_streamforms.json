    "description": "# Wagtail StreamForms\n\n[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/AccentDesign/wagtail_streamforms/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/AccentDesign/wagtail_streamforms/tree/master)\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/AccentDesign/wagtail_streamforms/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/AccentDesign/wagtail_streamforms?branch=master)\n\nThis package is currently a concept but allows you to add add forms that are built in the cms admin area to\nany streamfield. You can also create your own form templates which will then appear as a template choice when you build\nyour form. This allows you to decide how the form is submitted and to where.\n\nDocumentation is currently being worked on but the basics are below\n\n\n## Whats included?\n\n- Forms can be built in the cms admin and used site wide in any streamfield.\n- You can create your own form templates to display/submit how ever you wish to do it.\n- We have included a mixin which will handle the form post if it is being submitted to a wagtail page.\n- Forms are catagorised by their class in the cms admin for easier navigation.\n- Form submissions are also listed by their form which you can filter by date and are ordered by newest first.\n- Recaptcha can be added to a form.\n- You can also add site wide regex validators fo use in regex fields.\n\n\n## Screen shots\n\n![Screen1](/images/screen1.png)\n\n![Screen2](/images/screen2.png)\n\n![Screen3](/images/screen3.png)\n\n![Screen4](/images/screen4.png)\n\n![Screen5](/images/screen5.png)\n\n\n## General setup\n\nAdd wagtail_streamforms to your INSTALLED_APPS:\n\n```\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n    ...\n    'wagtail_streamforms'\n    ...\n]\n```\n\nNext define the form templates in your settings.py:\n\n```\n# this is the defaults \nWAGTAIL_STREAMFORMS_FORM_TEMPLATES = (\n    ('streamforms/form_block.html', 'Default Form Template'),\n)\n```\n\nand if you want to the admin base area label:\n\n```\n# this is the default\nWAGTAIL_STREAMFORMS_ADMIN_MENU_LABEL = 'Streamforms'\n```\n\n\n## Optionally enable recaptcha\n\nHas been enabled via the [django-recaptcha](https://github.com/praekelt/django-recaptcha) package. \nPlease note that only one recapcha should be used per page, this is a known issue and we are looking to fix it.\n\nJust add captcha to your INSTALLED_APPS:\n\n```\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n    ...\n    'captcha'\n    ...\n]\n```\n\nAdd the required keys in your settings.py which you can get from google's recapcha service:\n\n```\nRECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY = 'xxx'\nRECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY = 'xxx'\n \n# To use the new No Captcha reCaptcha\nNOCAPTCHA = True\n```\n\n\n## Defining your own form functionality\n\nCurrently we have defined two different types of forms one which just enables saving the submission and one to \naddionally email the results of the submission, As shown [here](https://github.com/AccentDesign/wagtail_streamforms/blob/master/wagtail_streamforms/models/form.py#L112).\n\nYou can easily add your own all you have to do is create a model that inherits from our form base class add any addional\nfields/properties and this will be added to the cms admin area.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nfrom wagtail_streamforms.models import BaseForm\n\nclass SomeForm(BaseForm):\n\n    def process_form_submission(self, form):\n        super(SomeForm, self).process_form_submission(form) # handles the submission saving\n        # do your own stuff here\n\n```\n\n\n## Choosing a form in a streamfield\n\nThe below is an example of a page model with the form block in a stream field. It inherits from our form submission\nmixin fo that the forms can be posted to the page they appear on.\n\n```\nfrom wagtail.wagtailadmin.edit_handlers import StreamFieldPanel\nfrom wagtail.wagtailcore.fields import StreamField\nfrom wagtail.wagtailcore.models import Page\nfrom wagtail_streamforms.blocks import WagtailFormBlock\nfrom wagtail_streamforms.models import StreamFormPageMixin\n\n\nclass BasicPage(StreamFormPageMixin, Page):\n\n    body = StreamField([\n        ('form', WagtailFormBlock())\n    ])\n\n    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [\n        StreamFieldPanel('body'),\n    ]\n```\n\n\n## Example site with docker\n\nRun the docker container\n\n```bash\n$ docker-compose up\n```\n\nCreate yourself a superuser\n\n```bash\n$ docker exec -it <container_name> bash\n$ python manage.py createsuperuser\n```\n\nGo to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)\n\n\n## Testing\n\nInstall dependencies\n\nYou will need pyenv installed see [https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)\n\nAlso tox needs to be installed\n\n```bash\n$ pip install tox\n```\n\nInstall python versions in pyenv\n\n```bash\n$ pyenv install 3.4.4\n$ pyenv install 3.5.3\n$ pyenv install 3.6.2\n```\n\nSet local project versions\n\n```bash\n$ pyenv local 3.4.4 3.5.3 3.6.2\n```\n\nRun the tests\n\n```bash\n$ tox\n```\n\nor run for a single environment\n\n```bash\n$ tox -e py36-dj111-wt112\n```\n",
