    "description": "This engine emulates the Phoenix Wright games for the DS. It contains a scripting language for people to write their own stories in without having to learn python.\r\n\r\nhg repo and more info available here: http://code.google.com/p/pywright/\r\n\r\nIt's almost complete, and has been in development for 2 years. There are currently about 6 active projects on the fan forum at court-records.net building complete games using the engine, and a few of the games are actually close to complete. Some have said that Turnabout Substitution is better than the original games.",
