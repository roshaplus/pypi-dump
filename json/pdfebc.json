    "description": "pdfebc - PDF ebook compressor\n*****************************\n\n`Docs`_\n\n.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/pdfebc.svg\n    :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/pdfebc\n    :alt: PyPi Version\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/slarse/pdfebc.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/slarse/pdfebc\n    :alt: Build Status\n.. image:: https://codecov.io/gh/slarse/pdfebc/branch/master/graph/badge.svg\n    :target: https://codecov.io/gh/slarse/pdfebc\n    :alt: Code Coverage\n.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/pdfebc/badge/?version=latest\n    :target: http://pdfebc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n    :alt: Documentation Status\n\n.. contents::\n\nOverview\n========\n``pdfebc`` is a CLI tool that uses ``Ghostscript`` to compress PDF documents to a size that befits \nan ebook reader, such as a Kindle. The CLI works by targeting a source and output directory (if \nnot specified by the user, defults to use ``.`` for source and ``pdfebc_out`` for output), then \ncompresses all PDF files in the source directory and puts the results in the output directory. \nThere is also functionality for sending the compressed documents to a pre-configured e-mail \naddress using Google's SMTP server (which can easily be swapped for any SMTP server by editing \nthe source code, see **Requirements** below). Files that are less than 1 MB in size are not \ncompressed, as I have found that compressing such small files often leads to them increasing \nin size several times over instead (I have yet to figure out why). Do note that ``Ghostscript`` \nis fairly slow, so expect large files to take a while to compress.\n\nAs an example use case, I mainly use ``pdfebc`` as an easy way to compress lecture slides and \nsimilar study materials, send them to my Kindle and then clean up the output.\n\nPurpose of the project\n======================\nThe core functionality of ``pdfebc`` was already done when I started this little project. As \nsuch, the main purpose here isn't to provide the functionality, but to do so in a robust way, \nwith proper documentation, testing and continuous integration. It is, essentially, my first \nforay into using stuff like ``sphinx``, ``Travis-CI`` and ``ReadTheDocs``, so there's bound to be \nsome weirdness here and there.\n\nRequirements\n============\n* Python 3.6\n    - Strictly speaking, 3.5 should also work fine, but the tests use 3.6 features so the\n      build is only tested for 3.6.\n* ``Ghostscript``\n    - ``pdfebc`` requires ``Ghostscript`` for the PDF compression. The default binary is ``gs``,\n      but this can be specified via the CLI.\n* A Gmail account (for sending e-mails)\n    - By default, ``pdfebc`` uses Google's SMTP server to send e-mails. If you don't intend\n      to use the send functionality, then you may disregard this requirement.\n    - It is possible to use a different SMTP server by changing the ``SMTP_SERVER`` variable in the\n      ``pdfebc.utils`` module. Note that TLS is enabled and will likely cause sending e-mails\n      using a local server that does not have TLS impossible.\n\nInstall\n=======\nOption 1: Install from PyPi with ``pip``\n----------------------------------------\nThe latest release of ``pdfebc`` is on PyPi, and can thus be installed as usual with ``pip``.\nI strongly discourage global ``pip`` installs (i.e. ``sudo pip install <package>``), as this\nmay land you with incompatible packages in a very short amount of time. A per-user install\ncan be done like this:\n\n1. Execute ``pip install --user pdfebc`` to install the package.\n2. Type ``echo \"$PATH\"`` and verify that ``$HOME/.local/bin`` is on the ``PATH``.\n    - If it is not, add it by adding ``export PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin`` to your shell configuration\n      file (e.g. ``$HOME/.bashrc`` for ``bash``).\n    - Then execute ``source <path_to_config_file>``\n3. Verify the installation by executing ``pdfebc -h``. You should se usage information printed to stdout.\n4. Note that the first time you try to send an e-mail, the CLI will walk you through the creation\nof a configuration file. I strongly recommend that you use an `App password`_ instead of your actual \naccount password.\n\nOption 2: Clone the repo and the install with ``pip``\n-----------------------------------------------------\nIf you want the dev version, you will need to clone the repo, as only release versions are uploaded\nto PyPi. Unless you are planning to contribute something, I suggest going with the release version.\n\n1. Clone the repo with ``git``:\n    - ``git clone https://github.com/slarse/pdfebc``\n2. ``cd`` into the project root directory and install with ``pip``.\n    - ``pip install --user .``, global installs are not recommended.\n    - Or just ``pip install .`` if you use ``virtualenv``.\n    - For development, use ``pip install -e .`` in a ``virtualenv``.\n3. All done! Type ``pdfebc -h`` on the command line for usage.\n4. Note that the first time you try to send an e-mail, the CLI will walk you through the creation\nof a configuration file. I strongly recommend that you use an `App password`_ instead of your actual \naccount password.\n\nLicense\n=======\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.
