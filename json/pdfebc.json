    "description": "# pdfebc - PDF ebook compressor\n\n**[Docs](http://pdfebc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**\n\n[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pdfebc.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pdfebc)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/slarse/pdfebc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/slarse/pdfebc)\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/slarse/pdfebc/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/slarse/pdfebc)\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pdfebc/badge/?version=latest)](http://pdfebc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n\n\n## Overview\n`pdfebc` is a CLI tool that uses `Ghostscript` to compress PDF documents to a size that befits \nan ebook reader, such as a Kindle. The CLI works by targeting a source and output directory (if \nnot specified by the user, defults to use `.` for source and `pdfebc_out` for output), then \ncompresses all PDF files in the source directory and puts the results in the output directory. \nThere is also functionality for sending the compressed documents to a pre-configured e-mail \naddress using Google's SMTP server (which can easily be swapped for any SMTP server by editing \nthe source code, see **Requirements** below). Files that are less than 1 MB in size are not \ncompressed, as I have found that compressing such small files often leads to them increasing \nin size several times over instead (I have yet to figure out why). Do note that `Ghostscript` \nis fairly slow, so expect large files to take a while to compress.\n\nAs an example use case, I mainly use `pdfebc` as an easy way to compress lecture slides and \nsimilar study materials, send them to my Kindle and then clean up the output.\n\n### Purpose of the project\nThe core functionality of `pdfebc` was already done when I started this little project. As \nsuch, the main purpose here isn't to provide the functionality, but to do so in a robust way, \nwith proper documentation, testing and continuous integration. It is, essentially, my first \nforay into using stuff like `sphinx`, `Travis-CI` and `ReadTheDocs`, so there's bound to be \nsome weirdness here and there.\n\n### Requirements\n* Python 3.6\n    - Strictly speaking, 3.5 should also work fine, but the tests use 3.6 features so the\n    build is only tested for 3.6.\n* `Ghostscript`\n    - `pdfebc` requires `Ghostscript` for the PDF compression. The default binary is `gs`,\n    but this can be specified via the CLI.\n* A Gmail account (for sending e-mails)\n    - By default, `pdfebc` uses Google's SMTP server to send e-mails. If you don't intend\n    to use the send functionality, then you may disregard this requirement.\n    - It is possible to use a different SMTP server by changing the `SMTP_SERVER` variable in the\n    `pdfebc.utils` module. Note that TLS is enabled and will likely cause sending e-mails\n    using a local server that does not have TLS imnpossible.\n\n### Install\n1. Clone the repo with `git`:\n    - `git clone https://github.com/slarse/pdfebc`\n2. `cd` into the project root directory and install with `pip`.\n    - `pip install --user .`, global installs are not recommended.\n    - Or just `pip install .` if you use `virtualenv`.\n    - For development, use `pip install -e .` in a `virtualenv`.\n3. All done! Type `pdfebc -h` on the command line for usage.\n4. Note that the first time you try to send an e-mail, the CLI will walk you through the creation\nof a configuration file. I strongly recommend that you use an \n[App password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) instead of your\nactual account password.\n\n### License\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for specifics.\n\n### TODO\n* Improve code coverage.\n* Add more negative tests.\n",
