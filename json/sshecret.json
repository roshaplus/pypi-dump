    "description": "SSHecret\n========\n\n.. image:: https://photos.tylercipriani.com/thumbs/2f/ad8870548f45148167f0b41d6e0539/medium.jpg\n   :alt: Don't worry, I can keep a sshecret\n\nIf you have an encrypted ssh key for each domain you access (you should), and\nyou keep your unlocked keys in a single ssh-agent (you maybe shouldn't),\n**AND** you've ever decided you need to forward your ssh-agent, then you should\nfeel bad.\n\nIf you forward an ssh-agent with all your unique keys for every domain to a ssh\nserver that is compromised - all those unique keys for all those unique domains\nyou access?  **Kablooie!** Done. Have fun rotating them all.\n\n``sshecret`` is a tool that creates an ssh-agent for each identity file found\nin your ``ssh_config(5)`` and executes ssh commands for a particular host using\nan environment that has access to **only the key for that one host**.\n\nIf a server to which you've forwarded your ssh-agent is compromised, then only\nthe key used for that domain will be affected.\n\n``sshecret`` is a wrapper around ssh that automatically manages multiple\n``ssh-agent(1)`` sockets each containing only a single unlocked ssh key.\n``sshecret`` accepts the same parameters as ``ssh(1)`` - fundamentally\n``sshecret`` uses ``execve(2)`` to wrap ssh, modifying the environment to\nensure that each key in your ``ssh_config(5)`` uses its own ssh-agent.\n\nUse with git\n------------\n\nTo use ``sshecret`` with git, point ``GIT_SSH`` to use ``sshecret`` by adding\nthis to your shell initialization file (``~/.bashrc`` or the like)::\n\n    export GIT_SSH=sshecret\n\nLimitations\n-----------\n\n``sshecret`` obviously won't help you if you're using the same ssh key for\nmultiple domains. You are clearly beyond help.\n\n``sshecret`` depends on a correct ``ssh_config(5)`` for your user (found at\n``~/.ssh/config`` or wherever ``$SSH_CONF`` is pointing), so it'll get weird if\nthat file is weird or nonexistent. Sorry, I guess.\n\n**Requirements**:\n\n* Paramiko_\n\n.. _Paramiko: http://www.paramiko.org/\n\n**Usage**::\n\n  usage: sshecret [whatever you want to pass to ssh]\n\n  sshecret is a wrapper around ssh that automatically manages multiple\n  ssh-agent(1)s each containing only a single ssh key.\n\n      EXAMPLE: sshecret -A -L8080:localhost:80 -l johndoe -p2222 example.com\n\n  sshecret accepts the same parameters as ssh(1) - fundamentally sshecret uses\n  execve(2) to wrap ssh, modifying the environment to ensure that each key in\n  your ssh_config(5) uses its own ssh- agent.\n\n  optional arguments:\n    -h, --help  show this help message and exit\n    -v          Increase verbosity of output\n\n\n",
