    "description": "# Wfuzz - The Web Fuzzer\n\nWfuzz has been created to facilitate the task in web applications assessments and it is based on a simple concept: it replaces any reference to the FUZZ keyword by the value of a given payload.\n\nA payload in Wfuzz is a source of data.\n\nThis simple concept allows any input to be injected in any field of an HTTP request, allowing to perform complex web security attacks in different web application components such as: parameters, authentication, forms, directories/files, headers, etc.\n\nWfuzz is more than a web content scanner:\n\n* Wfuzz could help you to secure your web applications by finding and exploiting web application vulnerabilities. Wfuzz\u2019s web application vulnerability scanner is supported by plugins.\n\n* Wfuzz is a completely modular framework and makes it easy for even the newest of Python developers to contribute. Building plugins is simple and takes little more than a few minutes.\n\n* Wfuzz exposes a simple language interface to the previous HTTP requests/responses performed using Wfuzz or other tools, such as Burp. This allows you to perform manual and semi-automatic tests with full context and understanding of your actions, without relying on a web application scanner underlying implementation.\n\n\nIt was created to facilitate the task in web applications assessments, it's a tool by pentesters for pentesters ;)\n\n## Installation \n\nTo install WFuzz, simply use pip:\n\n```\npip install wfuzz\n```\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is available at http://wfuzz.readthedocs.io\n\n## Download \n\nCheck github releases.
