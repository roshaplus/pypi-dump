This is because with some migrated databases, one may encounter a difficulty with the existing rules (they can not be erased if they are already used). The solution is then to force the existing ones to be non-updatable. And this is done using an included pre-migration script.\n    * As this module proposes its own report (same as the original, but with its own footer), don't forget to make it non-updatable.\n    * If you choose to uninstall this module, you have to manually delete the rules.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\nV1.0.0: 2014-11-07/Sge\n    * Add Salary rule categories.\n    * Add Salary rules.\n    * Add Employee children in school.\n    * Add Contract LPP rate.\n\nV1.0.1: 2014-11-11/Sge\n    * Set the 'LPP rate'' digits to 'Payroll Rate' decimal accuracy.\n\nV1.0.2:\n    * Add some minor changes, based on pull request #66 comments.\n\nV1.0.3-4:\n    * Add LPP Amount to contract.\n    * Add Worked Hours Rate to contract.\n    * Add Hourly Rate to contract.\n    * Compute the Wage of contract, based on Worked Hours and Hourly Rate.\n    * Add new salay rules\n\nV1.0.5:\n    * Add Holiday Rate to contract.\n    * Update \"Indemnit\u00e9 vacances 8,33%\" rule to include\n      \"Holiday Rate\" from contract.\n\nV1.0.6:\n    * Move salary rules from CSV file to XML file.\n    * Import salary rules only at install.\n    * Internal reorganization of files (.py and .xml).\n\nV1.0.7:\n    * Added: two new dependencies (hr_contract and hr_attendance)\n\nV1.0.8:\n    * Updated: the \"Appears on slip\" settings\n    * Integrated: report for the payslip, with its own footer\n    * Added: a pre-migration script\n    * pre-migration script correctly set\n\nV1.1:\n    * New: commissions and reimbursements management in pay slips and contracts\n\nV1.2:\n    * Journal entries generated by the confirmation of a payslip now inherits correctly of the partner's name\nV1.3:\n    * Move commission and reimbursement management to hr_payroll_commission and hr_payroll_expense modules\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n* Sebastien Gendre <sge@open-net.ch>\n* Yvon-Philippe Crittin <cyp@open-net.ch>\n\nMaintainer\n----------\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nTo contribute to this module, please visit http://odoo-community.org.\n\n\n",
