The\nmaterials are designed with these ideas in mind:\n\n- That students can learn about mechanical vibrations engineering through\n  \"computational thinking\" and \"computational experimentation\", i.e. actively\n  interacting with a computer by writing code to simulate and analyze\n  computational models and experimental data.\n- That the computer allows students to solve vibration engineering problems\n  without knowing all of the mathematical theory a priori. This means that we\n  can motivate students to dig deeper into the theory and by presenting it\n  posteriori when the motivation is high. The students will be introduced to\n  data analysis techniques to study vibrations before analytical techniques.\n- Students learn best by doing. The content is meant to used in class while the\n  instructors act as a coach through the learning.\n- That each lesson should have a motivated real life example that drives the\n  investigation.\n- Open access materials promote easy reuse, remixing, and dissemination.\n\nThe current course website can be found at:\n\nhttps://moorepants.github.io/eng122/\n\nAll of the Jupyter notebooks are rendered at:\n\nhttp://moorepants.github.io/resonance\n\nLearning Objectives\n===================\n\nThere are three broad learning objectives that we focus on in the course:\n\n1. Students will be able to analyze vibrational measurement data to draw\n   conclusions about the measured system's vibrational nature and describe how\n   the systems behaves vibrational.\n2. Students will be able to create simple mathematical and computational models\n   of real vibrating systems that can be used to answer specific questions\n   about the system by concisely demonstrating the vibrational phenomena.\n3. Students will be able to design a mechanical structure that has desirable\n   vibrational behavior.\n\nStudents that master these three core learning objectives will be well prepared\nto use mechanical vibration concepts, theories, and tools to solve engineering\nproblems.\n\nFor a more detailed topical outline with specific per-activity learning\nobjectives see the `outline <outline.rst>`_.\n\nAssessment\n==========\n\nThe students will be assessed through a series of in- and out-of- class\nexercises that focus on individual lesson topics, two examinations, and on an\nindividual open-ended vibration design project.\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\n- Jason K.
