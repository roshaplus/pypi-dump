    "description": "===========================\nInstalling and Using Cjklib\n===========================\n\n.. contents::\n\nIntroduction\n============\nCjklib provides language routines related to Han characters (characters based\non Chinese characters named Hanzi, Kanji, Hanja and chu Han respectively) used\nin writing of the Chinese, the Japanese, infrequently the Korean and formerly\nthe Vietnamese language(s). Functionality is included for character\npronunciations, radicals, glyph components, stroke decomposition and variant\ninformation.\n\nDependencies\n============\n- Python_ 2.4 or above (currently no support for Python3)\n- SQLite_ 3+\n- SQLAlchemy_ 0.5+\n- pysqlite2_ (already ships with Python 2.5 and above)\n\nAlternatively for MySQL as backend:\n\n- MySQL_ 5+\n- MySQL-Python_\n\n.. _Python: http://www.python.org/download/\n.. _SQLite: http://www.sqlite.org/download.html\n.. _MySQL: http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/\n.. _SQLAlchemy: http://www.sqlalchemy.org/download.html\n.. _pysqlite2: http://code.google.com/p/pysqlite/downloads/list\n.. _MySQL-Python: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/\n\nInstalling\n==========\n\nWindows\n-------\nInstall cjklib using the provided ``.exe`` installer. Make sure above\ndependencies are satisfied.\n\nThree scripts ``cjknife.exe``, ``buildcjkdb.exe``, and ``installcjkdict.exe``\nwill be added to the Python ``Scripts`` sub-directory. Make sure this directory\nis included in your ``PATH`` environment variable to access these programs from\nthe command line.\n\nCJK dictionaries are not included by default. If you want to install any of\nthose run the following (with an Internet connection) from the root directory\nof the source package::\n\n    $ installcjkdict CEDICT\n\nThis will download CEDICT, create a SQLite database file and install it under\nthe directory given by the ``APPDATA`` environment variable, e.g.\n``C:\\windows\\profiles\\MY_USER\\Application Data\\cjklib``. Just substitute\n``CEDICT`` for any other supported dictionary (i.e. EDICT, CEDICT, HanDeDict,\nCFDICT, CEDICTGR).\n\nUnix\n----\nIf you are installing from the source package you need to deploy the library on\nyour system::\n\n    $ sudo python setup.py install\n\nAlso make sure above dependencies are satisfied. CJK dictionaries are not\nincluded by default. If you want to install any of those run the following\n(with an Internet connection)::\n\n    $ sudo installcjkdict CEDICT\n\nThis will download CEDICT, create a SQLite database file and install it to\n``/usr/local/share/cjklib``. Just substitute ``CEDICT`` for any other supported\ndictionary (i.e. EDICT, CEDICT, HanDeDict, CFDICT, CEDICTGR).\n\n\nDocumentation & Usage\n=====================\nDocumentation_ is available online. Also see the `project page`_ and its wiki.\nThere is a small command line tool ``cjknife`` that offers some of the library's\nfunctions. See ``cjknife --help`` for an overview.\n\n.. _Documentation: http://cjklib.org/\n.. _project page: http://code.google.com/p/cjklib/\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n- Get stroke order of characters::\n\n    >>> from cjklib import characterlookup\n    >>> cjk = characterlookup.CharacterLookup('C')\n    >>> cjk.getStrokeOrder(u'\u8bf4')\n    [u'\u31d4', u'\u31ca', u'\u31d4', u'\u31d2', u'\u31d1', u'\u31d5', u'\u31d0', u'\u31d3', u'\u31df']\n\n- Access a dictionary (here using Jim Breen's EDICT)::\n\n    >>> from cjklib.dictionary import EDICT\n    >>> d = EDICT()\n    >>> d.getForTranslation('Tokyo')\n    [EntryTuple(Headword=u'\u6771\u4eac', Reading=u'\u3068\u3046\u304d\u3087\u3046',\n    Translation=u'/(n) Tokyo (current capital of Japan)/(P)/')]\n\n\nDatabase\n========\nPackaged versions of the library will ship with a pre-built SQLite database\nfile. You can however easily rebuild the database yourself.\n\nFirst download the newest Unihan file::\n\n    $ wget ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Unihan.zip\n\nThen start the build process::\n\n    $ sudo buildcjkdb -r build cjklibData\n\nSQLite\n------\nSQLite by default has no Unicode support for string operations. Optionally the\nICU library can be compiled in for handling alphabetic non-ASCII characters.\nCjklib can register own Unicode functions if ICU support is missing. Queries\nwith ``LIKE`` will then use function ``lower()``. This compatibility mode has\nnegative impact on performance and as it is not needed for dictionaries like\nEDICT or CEDICT it is disabled by default. See ``cjklib.conf`` for enabling.\n\nMySQL\n-----\nWith MySQL 5 the following ``CREATE`` command creates a database with ``utf8``\nas character set using the general Unicode collation\n(MySQL from 5.5.3 on will support full Unicode given character set\n``utf8mb4`` and collation ``utf8mb4_bin``)::\n\n    CREATE DATABASE cjklib DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;\n\nYou might need to set access rights, too (substitute ``user_name`` and\n``host_name``)::\n\n    GRANT ALL ON cjklib.* TO 'user_name'@'host_name';\n\nNow update the settings in  ``cjklib.conf``.\n\nMySQL < 5.5 doesn't support full UTF-8, and uses a version with max 3 bytes, so\ncharacters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) can't be encoded. Building\nthe Unihan database thus might result in warnings, characters above U+FFFF\ncan't be built at all. You need to disable building the full character range\nby setting ``wideBuild`` to ``False`` in ``cjklib.conf`` before building.\nAlternatively pass ``--wideBuild=False`` to ``buildcjkdb``.\n\n\nContact\n=======\nFor help or discussions on cjklib, join `cjklib-devel@googlegroups.com\n<http://groups.google.com/group/cjklib-devel>`_.\n\nPlease report bugs to the `project's bug tracker\n<http://code.google.com/p/cjklib/issues/list>`_.",
