    "description": ".. image:: https://travis-ci.org/rmjarvis/TreeCorr.svg?branch=master\n        :target: https://travis-ci.org/rmjarvis/TreeCorr\n.. image:: https://codecov.io/gh/rmjarvis/TreeCorr/branch/master/graph/badge.svg\n        :target: https://codecov.io/gh/rmjarvis/TreeCorr\n\n\nTreeCorr is a package for efficiently computing 2-point and 3-point correlation\nfunctions.\n\n- The code is hosted at https://github.com/rmjarvis/TreeCorr\n- It can compute correlations of regular number counts, weak lensing shears, or\n  scalar quantities such as convergence or CMB temperature fluctutations.\n- 2-point correlations may be auto-correlations or cross-correlations.  This\n  includes shear-shear, count-shear, count-count, kappa-kappa, etc.  (Any\n  combination of shear, kappa, and counts.)\n- 3-point correlations currently can only be auto-correlations.  This includes\n  shear-shear-shear, count-count-count, and kappa-kappa-kappa.  The cross\n  varieties are planned to be added in the near future.\n- Both 2- and 3-point functions can be done with the correct curved-sky \n  calculation using RA, Dec coordinates, on a Euclidean tangent plane, or in\n  3D using either (RA,Dec,r) or (x,y,z) positions.\n- The front end is in Python, which can be used as a Python module or as a \n  standalone executable using configuration files. (The executable is corr2\n  for 2-point and corr3 for 3-point.)\n- The actual computation of the correlation functions is done in C++ using ball\n  trees (similar to kd trees), which make the calculation extremely efficient.\n- When available, OpenMP is used to run in parallel on multi-core machines.\n- Approximate running time for 2-point shear-shear is ~30 sec * (N/10^6) / core\n  for a bin size b=0.1 in log(r).  It scales as b^(-2).  This is the slowest\n  of the various kinds of 2-point correlations, so others will be a bit faster,\n  but with the same scaling with N and b.\n- The running time for 3-point functions are highly variable depending on the \n  range of triangle geometries you are calculating.  They are significantly\n  slower than the 2-point functions, but many orders of magnitude faster than\n  brute force algorithms.\n- **If you use TreeCorr in published research, please reference:\n  Jarvis, Bernstein, & Jain, 2004, MNRAS, 352, 338**\n  (I'm working on new paper about TreeCorr, including some of the improvements\n  I've made since then, but this will suffice as a reference for now.)\n- Record on the Astrophyics Source Code Library: http://ascl.net/1508.007\n- Developed by Mike Jarvis.  Fee free to contact me with questions or comments\n  at mikejarvis17 at gmail.  Or post an issue (see below) if you have any\n  problems with the code.\n\nThe code is licensed under a FreeBSD license.  Essentially, you can use the \ncode in any way you want, but if you distribute it, you need to include the \nfile ``TreeCorr_LICENSE`` with the distribution.  See that file for details.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe easiest way to install TreeCorr is with pip::\n\n    sudo pip install TreeCorr\n\nIf you have previously installed TreeCorr, and want to upgrade to a new\nreleased version, you should do::\n\n    sudo pip install TreeCorr --upgrade\n\nTo install TreeCorr on a system where you do not have sudo privileges,\nyou can do::\n\n    pip install TreeCorr --user\n\nThis installs the Python module into ``~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages``,\nwhich is normally already in your PYTHONPATH, but it puts the executables\n``corr2`` and ``corr3`` into ``~/.local/bin`` which is probably not in your PATH.\nTo use these scripts, you should add this directory to your PATH.  If you would\nrather install into a different prefix rather than ~/.local, you can use::\n\n    pip install TreeCorr --install-option=\"--prefix=PREFIX\"\n\nThis would install the executables into ``PREFIX/bin`` and the Python module\ninto ``PREFIX/lib/python2.7/site-packages``.\n\n\nIf you would rather download the tarball and install TreeCorr yourself,\nthat is also relatively straightforward:\n\n1. Dependencies: All dependencies should be installed automatically for you by\n   setup.py, so you should not need to worry about these.  But if you are\n   interested, the dependencies are:\n\n   - numpy\n   - future\n   - fitsio\n   - pandas\n   - pyyaml\n   - cffi\n\n   The last dependency is the only one that typically could cause any problems, since it in\n   turn depends on a library called libffi.  This is a common thing to have installed already\n   on linux machines, so it is likely that you won't have any trouble with it, but if you get\n   errors about \"ffi.h\" not being found, then you may need to either install it yourself or\n   update your paths to include the directory where ffi.h is found.\n\n   a) Installing libffi on linux systems:\n\n      If you have root access on your system, then one of the following should work to install\n      libffi::\n\n            apt-get install libffi-dev\n            yum install libffi-devel\n\n   b) Installing libffi on Mac systems:\n\n      It should be installed as part of the XCode libraries after running::\n\n            xcode-select --install\n\n   c) Installing libffi manually:\n\n      If neither of the above methods works for you, you can install it yourself with the\n      following commands::\n\n            wget ftp://sourceware.org:/pub/libffi/libffi-3.2.1.tar.gz\n            tar xfz libffi-3.2.1.tar.gz\n            cd libffi-3.2.1\n            ./configure --prefix={prefix}\n            make\n            make install\n            cp */include/ffi*.h {prefix}/include\n            cd ..\n\n      where {prefix} is wherever you want the code to be installed.  e.g. /home/username.\n\n   d) Updating your system paths:\n\n      If you used option (c) above and ``{prefix}`` is not ``/usr/local`` or similar, then you\n      might need to update some system paths to let the compiler know where to look for the header\n      file and library.  Similarly, if libffi was already installed, but it is in a non-standard\n      location where gcc doesn't look by default, then this also applies.  (Try ``locate ffi.h``\n      to see if it shows up somewhere.)\n\n      Assuming ``ffi.h`` is in ``{prefix}/include/ffi/`` and ``libffi.so`` (or ``libffi.dylib`` on\n      Macs) is in ``{prefix}/lib/``, then the following commands should be put in your ``.bashrc``\n      or ``.bash_profile`` file::\n\n            export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$C_INCLUDE_PATH:{prefix}/include\n            export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:{prefix}/lib\n            export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:{prefix}/lib\n\n      Or if you use C shell, put the following in ``.cshrc`` or equivalent file::\n\n            setenv C_INCLUDE_PATH \"$C_INCLUDE_PATH\":{prefix}/include\n            setenv LIBRARY_PATH \"$LIBRARY_PATH\":{prefix}/lib\n            setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH \"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\":{prefix}/lib\n\n\n2. Download the zip file or tarball for the latest release from:\n\n   https://github.com/rmjarvis/TreeCorr/releases/\n\n3. Unzip the archive with either of the following (depending on which kind\n   of archive you downloaded)::\n\n        unzip TreeCorr-3.3.7.zip\n        tar xvzf TreeCorr-3.3.7.tar.gz\n\n   It will unzip into the directory TreeCorr-3.3.7. Change to that directory::\n\n        cd TreeCorr-3.3.7\n\n4. Install with the normal setup.py options.  Typically this would be the\n   command::\n\n        python setup.py install --prefix=~\n\n   This will install the executable ``corr2`` at::\n\n        /your/home/directory/bin/corr2\n\n   It will also install the Python module called ``treecorr`` which you can use\n   from within Python.\n\n   .. note::\n\n        There is a bug with numpy that it sometimes doesn't install correctly\n        when included as a setup.py dependency:\n\n            https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/1458  \n\n        The bug was marked closed in 2012, but I've gotten it with numpy\n        versions since then. Installation failed with a traceback that ended\n        with::\n\n            File \"/private/tmp/easy_install-xl4gri/numpy-1.8.2/numpy/core/setup.py\", line 631, in configuration\n\n            AttributeError: 'Configuration' object has no attribute 'add_define_macros'\n\n        The workaround if this happens for you seems to be to install numpy\n        separately with::\n\n            easy_install numpy\n\n        Then the normal TreeCorr installation should work correctly.\n\n\n\n5. (optional) If you want to run the unit tests, you can do the following::\n\n        cd tests\n        nosetests\n\n\n\nTwo-point Correlations\n----------------------\n\nThis software is able to compute several varieties of two-point correlations:\n\n:NN:  The normal two-point correlation function of number counts (typically\n      galaxy counts).\n\n:GG:  Two-point shear-shear correlation function.\n\n:KK:  Nominally the two-point kappa-kappa correlation function, although any\n      scalar quantity can be used as \"kappa\".  In lensing, kappa is the \n      convergence, but this could be used for temperature, size, etc.\n\n:NG:  Cross-correlation of counts with shear.  This is what is often called\n      galaxy-galaxy lensing.\n\n:NK:  Cross-correlation of counts with kappa.  Again, \"kappa here can be any scalar\n      quantity.\n\n:KG:  Cross-correlation of convergence with shear.  Like the NG calculation, but \n      weighting the pairs by the kappa values the foreground points.\n\n\nThree-point Correlations\n------------------------\n\nThis software is currently only able to compute three-point auto-correlations:\n\n:NNN: Three-point correlation function of number counts.\n\n:GGG: Three-point shear correlation function.  We use the \"natural components\"\n      called Gamma, described by Schneider & Lombardi [Astron.Astrophys. 397\n      (2003) 809-818] using the triangle centroid as the reference point.\n\n:KKK: Three-point kappa correlation function.  Again, \"kappa\" here can be any\n      scalar quantity.\n\n\nRunning corr2 and corr3\n-----------------------\n\nThe executables corr2 and corr3 each take one required command-line argument,\nwhich is the name of a configuration file::\n\n    corr2 config_file\n    corr3 config_file\n\nA sample configuration file for corr2 is provided, called sample.params.  \nSee the TreeCorr wiki page\n\nhttps://github.com/rmjarvis/TreeCorr/wiki/Configuration-Parameters\n\nfor the complete documentation about the allowed parameters.\n\nYou can also specify parameters on the command line after the name of \nthe configuration file. e.g.::\n\n    corr2 config_file file_name=file1.dat gg_file_name=file1.out\n    corr2 config_file file_name=file2.dat gg_file_name=file2.out\n    ...\n\nThis can be useful when running the program from a script for lots of input \nfiles.\n\n\nUsing the Python module\n-----------------------\n\nHere we only give a quick overview.  A Jupyter notebook tutorial here:\n\nhttps://github.com/rmjarvis/TreeCorr/blob/master/tests/Tutorial.ipynb\n\ngoes into more detail.  And full Sphinx-generated documentation can be found at:\n\nhttp://rmjarvis.github.io/TreeCorr/html/index.html\n\nThe TreeCorr module is called ``treecorr`` in Python.  Typical usage for\ncomputing the shear-shear correlation function looks something like the\nfollowing::\n\n    >>> import treecorr\n    >>> cat = treecorr.Catalog('cat.fits', ra_col='RA', dec_col='DEC',\n    ...                        ra_units='degrees', dec_units='degrees',\n    ...                        g1_col='GAMMA1', g2_col='GAMMA2')\n    >>> gg = treecorr.GGCorrelation(min_sep=1., max_sep=100., bin_size=0.1,\n    ...                             sep_units='arcmin')\n    >>> gg.process(cat)\n    >>> xip = gg.xip  # The xi_plus correlation function\n    >>> xim = gg.xim  # The xi_minus correlation function\n\nThe different correlation functions each have their own class.  You can \naccess the Python documentation by calling help on the appropriate class\nto get more details about the different kwarg options, attributes, and \nmethods for each::\n\n    >>> help(NNCorrelation)\n    >>> help(GGCorrelation)\n    >>> help(KKCorrelation)\n    >>> help(NGCorrelation)\n    >>> help(NKCorrelation)\n    >>> help(KGCorrelation)\n    >>> help(NNNCorrelation)\n    >>> help(GGGCorrelation)\n    >>> help(KKKCorrelation)\n\nYou can also leverage the configuration file apparatus from within Python\nusing a Python dict for the configuration parameters::\n\n    >>> import treecorr\n    >>> config = treecorr.read_config(config_file)\n    >>> config['file_name'] = 'file1.dat'\n    >>> config['gg_file_name'] = 'file1.out'\n    >>> treecorr.corr2(config)\n    >>> config['file_name'] = 'file2.dat'\n    >>> config['gg_file_name'] = 'file2.out'\n    >>> treecorr.corr2(config)\n\nHowever, the Python module gives you much more flexibility in how to specify\nthe input and output, including going directly from and to numpy arrays within\nPython.  For a slightly longer \"Getting Started\" guide see the wiki page:\n\nhttps://github.com/rmjarvis/TreeCorr/wiki/Guide-to-using-TreeCorr-in-Python\n\n\nReporting bugs\n--------------\n\nIf you find a bug running the code, please report it at:\n\nhttps://github.com/rmjarvis/TreeCorr/issues\n\nClick \"New Issue\", which will open up a form for you to fill in with the\ndetails of the problem you are having.\n\n\nRequesting features\n-------------------\n\nIf you would like to request a new feature, do the same thing.  Open a new\nissue and fill in the details of the feature you would like added to TreeCorr.\nOr if there is already an issue for your desired feature, please add to the \ndiscussion, describing your use case.
