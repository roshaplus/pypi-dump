    "description": "pg_ninja is a tool for replicating and obfuscating the data in real time from MySQL to PostgreSQL, compatible with Python 2.7.\nThe system use the library mysql-replication to pull the row images from MySQL which are transformed into a jsonb object. \nA pl/pgsql function decodes the jsonb and replays the changes into the PostgreSQL database.\n\nThe tool requires an  initial replica setup which pulls the data from MySQL in read only mode. \nThis is done by the tool running FLUSH TABLE WITH READ LOCK;  .\n\npg_ninja can pull the data from a cascading replica when the MySQL slave is configured with log-slave-updates.",
