    "description": "Introduction\n============\n\nThis contains two dexterity behaviors, vocabularies and indexers for\ntwo 'taxonomy-like' fields:\n\n- ``classifiers_themes`` (e.g. `Air`, `Air > Quality`, `Air >\n  Pollution`, `Water`)\n\n- ``classifiers_categories`` (e.g. `Report`, `Project`, `Project\n  > Management`)\n\n\nUse case\n========\n\nYou want to show some information on your website and make it easy to\nfind it.  You have reports about air or about water.  You also have\nprojects about those themes or specifically about air quality.  Some\nprojects are about both air and water.  Some reports are specifically\nfor management and some are more technical.\n\nYou want to be able to search all projects that are about the theme\nair, whether this is about air in general or specifically about air\nquality.  You also want to search on air quality in particular,\nwithout finding the air pollution report.\n\nHow do you put this in a Plone Site?  A traditional way would be to\nmake two new content types: Report and Project.  You add a checkbox or\nradio button to both types so you can mark them as technical or for\nmanagement.  You use the tags field to add an `air quality` tag or\nother tags for the themes.\n\nThis can work, but it has a few downsides:\n\n- You need two new content types, even though apart from the checkbox\n  there is no difference between this and a standard page or maybe a\n  folder.\n\n- Not all tags are themes.  Editors may use tags for anything.  You\n  may have an add-on or some custom code that already uses tags, for\n  example to mark an item for showing up on the home page or in a\n  collection.  So the theme tags get lost in the other tags.\n\nAlternatively, instead of adding two new content types, you can use\ntags to tag a standard page as a project or report and as technical or\nfor management.  This clutters up the tags even more.\n\nTo mark an item as a certain theme, you can also use a taxonomy, for\nexample `collective.taxonomy`_.  This is more flexible than this\npackage, but it may be overkill, trying to do too much.\n\nInstead, ``collective.classifiers`` basically adds two fields, which\nget their data from two dictionaries in the Plone configuration\nregistry.\n\n\nInstallation and usage\n======================\n\nJust add ``collective.classifiers`` to the eggs of your zope instance\nin your buildout config, run buildout, and start the zope instance.\nGo to the Plone Add-ons control panel of your website.  First activate\nDexterity content types if you have not done so already.  Then activate\n``collective.classifiers``.\n\nGo to the `Classifiers Settings` control panel, which simply accesses\nthe Plone configuration registry with a filter on\n``collective.classifiers``.  You can edit the data there to create\ncategories and themes that fit your situation.  If editing does not\nwork because you get validation errors, please see the Dependencies_\nsection.\n\nLet's say you add this data:\n\n- Category `Report`, with sub categories `Management` and `Technical`.\n\n- Category `Product`, with no sub categories except a white space\n  character.  This is a trick to allow a top level category without\n  any sub categories, as the top level may be enough.  The same trick\n  can be done with themes.\n\n- Theme `Air`, with sub themes `Quality` and `Pollution`.\n\n- Theme `Water`, with sub themes `Rain` and `Rivers`.\n\nGo to a type on the Dexterity types control panel, for example a Page.\nActivate the categories classifiers and/or the themes classifiers\nbehavior.\n\nYou can now create or edit a Page and select multiple categories and\nthemes.  With the above data, you have these categories to choose from:\n\n- Report\n\n- Report > Management\n\n- Report > Technical\n\n- Product\n\nYou will have these themes:\n\n- Air\n\n- Air > Quality\n\n- Air > Pollution\n\n- Water\n\n- Water > Rain\n\n- Water > Rivers\n\nLet's say you pick as category `Report > Management` and you pick\ntwo themes: `Air` and `Water > Rain`.\n\nThe categories and themes are shown on the default view of the page,\nbut what is more interesting is that you can search for them in a\nCollection.  In the edit form of a Collection you can select\nClassifier Categories and Classifier Themes.  If you select as\ncategory either `Report` or `Report > Management`, the page will\nbe found.  If you select as theme either `Air`, `Water` or `Water\n> Rain`, the page will be found.\n\n\nDependencies\n============\n\nThis is tested on Plone 4.3.2 with one version updated to a newer\nrelease: plone.app.z3cform 0.7.5.  This should be the default in a\nfuture Plone 4.3.3 release.  If you use an older plone.app.z3cform\nrelease, editing the dictionaries through the web is not possible.\nYou would need to update the dictionaries by importing a\n``registry.xml`` with your wanted settings then.  See\n``collective/classifiers/profiles/testfixture/registry.xml`` for an\nexample.\n\nShould work with Plone 4.2 as well, with the same remark about not\nbeing able to edit the dictionaries through the web.\n\n\nSponsorship\n===========\n\nWork on collective.classifiers has been made possible by The Flemish\nEnvironment Agency or VMM. See http://www.vmm.be . VMM operates as an agency of\nthe Flemish government for a better environment in Flanders. Flanders is one of\nthe three Belgian regions with its own government, parliament and\nadministration. The other two are the Brussels-Capital Region and the Walloon\nRegion.\n\n\nTesting\n=======\n\nThis package is tested with Travis:\n\n.. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/collective/collective.classifiers.png\n    :target: http://travis-ci.org/collective/collective.classifiers\n\n.. _`collective.taxonomy`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.taxonomy\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n0.4.1 (2014-04-07)\n------------------\n\n- Nothing changed yet.\n\n\n0.4 (2014-03-05)\n----------------\n\n- Add upgrade step to fix the values currently in the catalog.\n  [maurits]\n\n- Do not let themes and categories end up in the catalog index when\n  the behavior is not activated for a portal_type.\n  [maurits]\n\n\n0.3 (2014-02-24)\n----------------\n\n- Handle case where values is None.\n  [maurits]\n\n\n0.2 (2014-02-24)\n----------------\n\n- Make values not required.  Until now you could fake an empty values\n  list by typing a space as value.  In some circumstances, next time\n  you edited the configuration, you would need to do this again\n  because the space was stripped.\n  [maurits]\n\n\n0.1 (2013-11-09)\n----------------\n\n- Initial release",
