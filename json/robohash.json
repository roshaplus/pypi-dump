    "description": "RoboHash, the source code for the site RoboHash.org\nOK, I'll admit I'm a crappy programmer.\nCompounding this, I wrote this code initially to be internal-only. It's ugly, and could be a LOT nicer.\nSorry about that.\n\nWhat it basically does is copy/paste the various robot pictures, using bits from the SHA hash.\nIt's not perfect, and not entirely secure, but it gives a good gut-check to \"Hey, this sha is wrong\"\n\nThe RoboHash images are available under the CC-BY-3.0 license.\nSet 1 artwork created by Zikri Kader\nSet 2 artwork created by Hrvoje Novakovic.\nSet 3 artwork created by Julian Peter Arias.\n\nThe Python Code is available under the MIT/Expat license\n\nCopyright (c) 2011, Colin Davis\n\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
