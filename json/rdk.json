    "description": "rdk\n===\nRule Development Kit - Version 2\nExtremely Alpha.  Do not use if you haven't personally talked to me.\n\nThe RDK is designed to support a \"Compliance-as-Code\" workflow that is intuitive and productive.  It abstracts away much of the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying AWS Config rules backed by custom lambda functions, and provides a streamlined dev-test-deploy iterative process.\n\nGetting Started\n===============\nUses python 2.7 and pip.  Requires you to have an AWS account and sufficient permissions to manage the Config service, and to creat S3 Buckets, Roles, and Lambda Functions.  Under the hood, rdk uses boto3 to make API calls to AWS, so you can set your credentials any way that boto3 recognizes (options 3 through 8 here: http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/configuration.html)\n\nClone the git repo, and then from the repo directory use pip to install the package.  Use the '-e' flag to generate symlinks so that any edits you make will be reflected when you run the installed package.\n\n::\n\n  $ pip install -e .\n\nTo make sure the rdk is installed correctly, running the package from the command line without any arguments should display help information.\n\n::\n\n  $ rdk\n  usage: rdk [-h] [--profile PROFILE] [--access-key ACCESS_KEY]\n           [--secret-access-key SECRET_ACCESS_KEY] [--region REGION]\n           [--verbose]\n           <command> ...\n  rdk: error: too few arguments\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nConfigure your env\n------------------\nTo use the RDK, create a directory that will be your working directory.  This should be committed to a source code repo.  In that directory, run the ``init`` command to set up your AWS Config environment and copy template files into a .rdk directory in your working directory.\n\n::\n\n  $ rdk init\n  Running init!\n  Waiting for IAM role to propagate\n  Config setup complete.\n  Config Service is ON\n\nCreate Rules\n------------\nIn your working directory, use the ``create`` command to start creating a new custom rule.  You must specify the runtime for the lambda function that will back the Rule, and you must also specify a resource type (or comma-separated list of types) that the Rule will evaluate.  This will add a new directory for the rule and populate it with several files, including a skeleton of your Lambda code.\n\n::\n\n  $ rdk create MyRule --runtime python2.7 --periodic One_Hour --input-parameters '{\"desiredInstanceType\":\"t2.micro\"}' --event AWS::EC2::Instance\n  Running create!\n\nEdit and Test Rules Locally\n---------------------------\nOnce you have created the rule, edit the python file in your rule directory (in the above example it would be ``MyRule/MyRule.py``) to add whatever logic your Rule requires in the ``evaluate_compliance`` method.  You will have access to the CI that was sent by Config, as well as any parameters configured for the Config Rule.  Your function should return either ``COMPLIANT``, ``NONCOMPLIANT``, or ``NOT_APPLICABLE``.\n\nWhile you are editing your Rule code you can test against generic CI's (custom CI specification is coming) using the ``test-local`` command:\n\n  $ rdk test-local MyRule --test-parameters '{\"desiredInstanceType\":\"t2.micro\"}'\n  Running test_local!\n  Testing MyRule\n  \tTesting with generic CI for configured Resource Type(s)\n  \t\tTesting CI AWS::EC2::Instance\n  \t\t\tCOMPLIANT\n\nyou can run the same test on all Rules in the working directory using the ``--all`` flag.\n\nModify Rule\n-----------\nIf you need to change the parameters of a Config rule in your working directory you can use the ``modify`` command.  This will overwrite all existing configuration for the rule.\n\n::\n\n  $ rdk modify MyRule --runtime python2.7 --periodic TwentyFour_Hours --input-parameters '{\"desiredInstanceType\":\"t2.micro\"}'\n  Running modify!\n  Modified Rule 'MyRule'\n\nIt is worth noting that until you actually call the ``deploy`` command your rule only exists in your working directory, none of the Rule commands discussed thus far actually makes changes to your account.\n\nDeploy Rule\n-----------\nOnce you have completed your compliance validation code and set your Rule's configuration, you can deploy the Rule to your account using the ``deploy`` command.  This will zip up your code (and the other associated code files) into a deployable package, copy that Zip file to S3, and then launch or update a CloudFormation stack that defines your Config Rule, Lambda function, and the necessary permissions and roles for it to function.  Since CloudFormation does not deeply inspect Lambda code objects in S3 to construct it's changeset, the ``deploy`` command will also directly update the Lambda function for any subsequent deployments to make sure code changes are propagated correctly.\n\n::\n\n  $ rdk deploy MyRule\n  Running deploy!\n  Zipping MyRule\n  Uploading MyRule\n  Creating CloudFormation Stack for MyRule\n  Waiting for CloudFormation stack operation to complete...\n  ...\n  Waiting for CloudFormation stack operation to complete...\n  Config deploy complete.\n\nTest Deployed Rule\n------------------\nWork in progress.  Currently you can use the ``test-remote`` command to exercise the Lambda function that's been created, however there are still some issues to work out.\n\nRunning the tests\n=================\n\nNo tests yet.\n\nContributing\n============\n\nemail me at mborch@amazon.com if you are interested in contributing.\n\nVersioning\n==========\n\nWe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.
