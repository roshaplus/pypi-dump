    "description": "pmcyg is a tool for creating offline Cygwin(TM) installers containing customized collections of Cygwin packages. This avoids having to download the entirety of a Cygwin release, which might occupy many GB, instead allowing installers that can be as small as 25MB. pmcyg will help build a self-contained CD or DVD installer to setup Cygwin on PCs without any internet access.",
