    "description": "**********\neke.review\n**********\n\nThis component, ``eke.review``, enables researchers, clinicians, and\nscientists part of a collaborative group within the Early Detection\nResearch Network (EDRN_) to perform quality analysis of the products of EDRN.\nIt works with the rest of the EDRN Knowledge Environment (EKE_) on the EDRN\npublic portal to enable easy and rapid turnaround during review cycles.\n\nAlthough intended for the EDRN public portal, this product may be installed\ninto any Plone_ portal.\n\n.. References:\n.. _EDRN: http://edrn.nci.nih.gov/\n.. _EKE: http://cancer.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/applications/knowledge-environment\n.. _Plone: http://plone.org/\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nUse Buildout_ with the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe.\n\n\u2022 Add ``eke.review`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::\n \n    [buildout]\n    ...\n    eggs =\n        ...\n        eke.review\n        \n\u2022 Re-run buildout, e.g. with::\n  \n    % ./bin/buildout\n        \nYou can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package\nfrom another package's configure.zcml file.\n\n.. References:\n.. _Buildout: http://www.buildout.org/\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\nA retrospective of the various releases this component has had, what's been\nchanged, what's been fixed, and so forth, follows.\n\n\n1.0.4 \u2014 I Had Some Chicken; Pass Me the FLOSS\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\u2022 First official release as free/libre/open source software.\n\n\n1.0.3 \u2014 Upgrades\n----------------\n\n\u2022 Uses z3c.autoinclude to automatically include dependencies\n\u2022 Compatible with Plone 4.3.\n\u2022 Remove unneeded release config.\n\n\n1.0.2 \u2014 Test Support\n--------------------\n\nThis release includes:\n\n* Depending on just Plone the framework instead of Plone the application.\n* Updating to the plone.app.testing fixtures.\n* Sadly it removes the ability to put URLFieldsetFolders into FieldsetFolders.\n  Hope that's OK!\n\n\n1.0.1 - Upgrade Cleanup\n-----------------------\n\nThis release updates the GenericSetup profile to 4, provides upgrade steps to\nthat profile.
