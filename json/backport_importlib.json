    "description": "Introduced in Python 3.1, the importlib package provides a pure Python\nimplementation of the import machinery.  It is also available on PyPI\nas a [very] watered down backport.\n\nThe backport_importlib package provides a script that will backport the\nfull importlib package to 2.x.  Keep in mind that the backport is quite\nnaive and likely incomplete.  However, it passes the rudimentary tests\nincluded in the script.\n\nThe script is optparse-based and the \"-h\" flag should be sufficient to\nsee how to use it.  For information on how to use importlib, please\nrefer to the current 3.x stdlib documentation.  The script will update\nthe importlib modules in-place, and will not install importlib for you.\nAlso, you have to provide your own copy of the 3.x importlib, which you\ncan get from hg.python.org/cpython (under Lib).\n\nIf you find cases where the backport could be improved please let me\nknow.  Also, it probably won't work for Python earlier than 2.4, so\nkeep that in mind.\n\nOne last thing.  A big reason that importlib was not released on PyPI\nas a full backport was to encourage adoption of 3.x.  I stand with\nBrett on that choice.  This tool is meant for the desparate only.  In\ntruth, importlib provides very little that you don't already have in\nthe 2.x import machinery, so if you think you need it you're probably\nwrong.",
