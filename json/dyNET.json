    "description": "The Dynamic Neural Network Toolkit\n\n**News!** The master branch is now DyNet version 2.0 (as of 6/28/2017),\nwhich contains a number of changes including a new model format, etc. If\nyou're looking for the old version, check out the `v1.1\nbranch <https://github.com/clab/dynet/tree/v1.1>`__.\n\nDyNet is a neural network library developed by Carnegie Mellon\nUniversity and many others. It is written in C++ (with bindings in\nPython) and is designed to be efficient when run on either CPU or GPU,\nand to work well with networks that have dynamic structures that change\nfor every training instance. For example, these kinds of networks are\nparticularly important in natural language processing tasks, and DyNet\nhas been used to build state-of-the-art systems for `syntactic\nparsing <https://github.com/clab/lstm-parser>`__, `machine\ntranslation <https://github.com/neubig/lamtram>`__, `morphological\ninflection <https://github.com/mfaruqui/morph-trans>`__, and many other\napplication areas.\n\nRead the `documentation <http://dynet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ to\nget started, and feel free to contact the `dynet-users\ngroup <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dynet-users>`__ group\nwith any questions (if you want to receive email make sure to select\n\"all email\" when you sign up). We greatly appreciate any bug reports and\ncontributions, which can be made by filing an issue or making a pull\nrequest through the `github page <http://github.com/clab/dynet>`__.\n\nYou can also read more technical details in our `technical\nreport <https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03980>`__.
