They are\ninserted into a page much like you would an image or hyperlink.\n\nBecause snippets are dynamically rendered, if you edit the snippet,\nits updated rich text is shown everywhere you had inserted the\nsnippet.\n\nThis is much more efficient and less error prone than copying and\npasting rich text in multiple places in your site.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nA university wants to display its number of enrolled students\nconsistently across its web site. Instead of manually updating each\npage that mentions the number of enrolled students and having to\nremember to change each of these pages whenever the enrollment number\nchanges (e.g. annually), a content editor would create a snippet\ncalled \"Enrollment Number\" containing the rich text \"13,491 students\"\nand would insert that snippet wherever the enrollment number needed to\nbe displayed.\n\nWhenever the official enrollment number changes, the content editor\nedits the \"Enrollment Number\" snippet to update the count,\ne.g. \"14,120 students\", and saves the change. All subsequent views of\npages that contained that snippet will display the updated number.\n\nHow to use\n----------\n\n- Edit your buildout.cfg to add uwosh.snippets to your eggs.\n- Run buildout.\n- Restart your instance or clients.\n- go to Site Setup -> Add-ons\n- Install uwosh.snippets\n\nA new folder called \"Snippets\" (with ID \".snippets\") will be created\nat the root of your site; that is the default location where the\nadd-on will look for snippets.\n\nNavigate to the Snippets folder. Add a Document (Page); give it a\nmeaningful title and summary to help you and other content editors\nlocate the snippet most easily; in the body of the Document, enter any\nrich text. You can use any TinyMCE formatting tools you wish, and you\ncan even use the HTML view to add and modify arbitrarily complex\nHTML. Save the Document. You have created your first snippet! You can\nuse this snippet in one or more places on your site.\n\nWhen you create or edit a Document (\"Page\"), TinyMCE will have a new\n\"{{}}\" toolbar icon. When you click it, you will see a list of all\nsnippets found in the Snippets folder. When you click on a snippet, a\nreference to it (a \"plug\") will be inserted into the rich text at the\ncursor location. When you press Save, instead of seeing the snippet\nplug you will see the rich text contents of the snippet.\n\nRequirements\n----------\n\nThe TinyMCE WYSIWYG editor needs to be installed and enabled. A basic\nunderstanding of its use is also highly recommended. For more\ninformation about TinyMCE, visit their `website\n<http://www.tinymce.com>`_.\n\n\nTODO\n----\n\n- would be nice: re-add support for add/edit/delete snippets in the modal\n- doesn't fit as well into how we're allowing snippets from anywhere on the site now\n  \nCredits\n-------\n\nThe original concept was developed by Sam Schwartz for the Office of International Education at University of Wisconsin Oshkosh.\n\nPlone 5 compatibility was developed by Nathan Van Gheem / Wildcard Corp. for Philip Bauer / Starzel.de.\n\nMaintainers\n-----------\n\nThis add-on is maintained by Wildcard Corp., https://wildcardcorp.com,\ndevelopers of the Castle CMS enhanced distribution of Plone,\nhttps://castlecms.io\n\nContributors\n============\n\n\n- Sam Schwartz, Author\n- Nathan Van Gheem\n- Gil Forcada\n- T.
