    "description": "Roadmap\n========\n\nRoadmap is a routing library powered by regular expressions. Roadmap was\ncreated to quickly map large amounts of input to functions. In the particular\ncase that sparked Roadmap's development, I was writing an IRC bot and I wanted\na fast (to code and to execute) way to map input strings to functions. Beyond an\nIRC bot, I could also picture Roadmap being used to process data from a web API,\nuser input, a socket, or really any stream of data.\n\nLinks\n======\n\n* `website <https://github.com/lightcatcher/roadmap>`_\n* `documentation <http://roadmap.readthedocs.org/>`_",
