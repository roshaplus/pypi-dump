OpenSearch helps search engines and search\n        clients communicate by introducing a common set of formats to perform\n        search requests and syndicate search results. The OpenSearch description\n        document format can be used to describe a search engine so that it can\n        be used by search client applications. The OpenSearch response elements\n        can be used to extend existing syndication formats, such as RSS and\n        Atom, with the extra metadata needed to return search results\n        \n        collective.opensearch enables you to syndicate the search results of\n        your plone site by formatting them in the RSS or Atom formats, augmented\n        with OpenSearch response elements.\n        \n        Implemented extensions and conventions\n        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n        \n        - opensearch\n        - relevance\n        - opensearch description for autodiscovery\n        - suggestions so that browsers can autocomplete\n        - response elements and first, previous, next, last links\n        \n        \n        Consume Open Search Feeds\n        -------------------------\n        \n        collective.opensearch adds a view to the link type that lets you\n        search OpenSearch (or other searches that return RSS or Atom, pretty\n        much any other format feed parser supports and KML) compatible search\n        providers within your site. The feeds do not need to implement\n        the opensearch extensions it suffices that they are valid feeds (e.g you\n        can query yahoo, bing, google site search or any plone site). When you\n        add a link with an open search url this view will be automatically set.\n        To search e.g. plone.org from your site add a Link with the url:\n        ``http://plone.org/search_rss?SearchableText={searchTerms}``\n        \n        You can combine several open search links as a metasearch. All\n        OpenSearch links inside a folder will be queried and their results\n        displayed when you change the view of a folder to 'Open Search View'\n        \n        \n        \n        Usage:\n        ------\n        \n        1) A single remote search\n        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n        \n        If you add a link content type with a open search description\n        compatible url (i.e. it has a parameter {searchTerms} in the querystring)\n        the view of the link will be set when the link is saved.\n        \n        The view consits of a simple searchform and the results of the query\n        \n        \n        \n        2) search multiple sources at once\n        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n        \n        To build a simple metasearch create a folder and add your query links to it.\n        Change the view of the folder to 'Open Search View'.\n        The view consist of a search form (currently only for full text search)\n        which input will be appied to all open search links (i.e. any link that\n        has  'Open Search View' set as its view). The results of the\n        searches will be displayed in tabs beneath the form. The queries are\n        executed asynchronously via AJAX, so you do not have to wait until the\n        last query has finished.\n        \n        \n        \n        Abusing collective.opensearch to display miscelaneous feeds\n        -----------------------------------------------------------\n        \n        3) display an abritary 'static' feed\n        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n        \n        Allthough the main focus of this product is to produce and display\n        search feeds you may use it to display any valid feed. If the url of the\n        link you added does not contain the {searchTerms} parameter and  'Open Search View'\n        (you have to select the view manually from the 'display' menu) is\n        selected as the view of the link, the feed will be fetched regardless of\n        the presence of a query parameter and its results will be displayed.\n        The search form will not be displayed in the absence of the\n        ``{searchTerms}`` parameter.\n        \n        4) display multiple feeds\n        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n        \n        Add your feeds to display to a folder (as in [2]) and select  'Open Search View'\n        as the display view of the folder All feeds that do not have a\n        ``{searchTerms}`` parameter in their url will be fetched immediately,\n        regardless if a search input was provided. The search form will only be\n        displayed if at least one of the links inside the folder has a\n        ``{searchTerms}`` parameter.\n        \n        \n        \n        5) Use collective.opensearch to search inside your collections\n        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n        \n        As opensearch results are added to all collections you may use it as a\n        searchform to search inside your collections. if you use a relative\n        link (e.g. /mycollection/SearchableText={searchTerms}) you have to\n        choose  'Open Search View' manually to display the search results.\n        \n        Known limitations issues and caveats\n        ------------------------------------\n        \n        - Currently only the {searchTerms} parameter for full text search is recognized and supported\n        - add '<match path=\"regex:^.*/opensearchresults.html*\" abort=\"1\" />' to your deliverance/xdv/diazo rules\n        - internal searches as described in [5] will always be executed as 'anonymous'\n        \n        \n        - Code repository: https://github.com/collective/collective.opensearch\n        - Report bugs at https://github.com/collective/collective.opensearch/issues\n        \n        \n        Changelog\n        =========\n        \n        1.5 (2014/01/08)\n        ----------------\n        \n        - add JSON Results view\n        \n        1.4 (2011/06/17)\n        ----------------\n        \n        - plone 4.1 compatible\n        - give diazo/deliverance a hint not to style the ajax response\n        \n        1.3 (2011/05/19)\n        ----------------\n        \n        - support http://www.eprints.org/ result feeds (not open search compliant but widely used)\n        \n        1.2 (2011/05/18)\n        ----------------\n        \n        - catch all exceptions in AutoDiscovery viewlet\n        \n        1.1 (2011/05/11)\n        ----------------\n        \n        - cache feeds when fetching remote searchresults\n        - display opensearch:totalresults when available\n        - show different opensearchdescriptions for site and topic\n        - add opensearch views to topics, search inside topics\n        - add configuration what indexes to use for categorization, abstract atom\n        - and rss view entries\n        \n        1.0 (2011/03/29)\n        ----------------\n        \n        - Created recipe with ZopeSkel\n        - implement all functionality from PLOS and JaoP\n        - add opensearch view for link\n        - add opensearch view for folder, all opensearch links inside that folder act as a metasearch\n        \n        JaoP  0.1 (Sep 23, 2008)\n        ------------------------\n        \n        - First Jaop release with the default opensearch properties\n        - Added default autodiscovery page ( need some changes ) for Firefox / IE\n        - Implemented the rss view\n        - Implemented the alpha version of suggestions\n        \n        \n        PLOS 0.2 (Jul 21, 2007)\n        -----------------------\n        \n        - Enable Plone to search OpenSearch compliant search providers\n        - added search feed content type\n        - additions to the RSS and ATOM responses\n        \n        \n        PLOS 0.1 (May 24, 2007)\n        -----------------------\n        \n        - initial release",
