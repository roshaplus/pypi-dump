Go to 'Inventory / Settings' and activate the option 'Advanced routing of\n   products using rules'.\n#. Define a putaway strategy in the location zone where the finished products\n   are supposed to be placed, and indicate the specific sub-location/bin\n   where the products should be placed.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo use this module proceed as follows:\n\n#. Create a manufacturing order and indicate the product and the finished\n   products location zone.\n#. Confirm the manufacturing order.\n#. You will notice that the finished products location has changed to the\n   putaway location, and the chatter shows a message indicating that the\n   putaway strategy was applied.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/129/9.0\n\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/manufacture/issues>`_.
