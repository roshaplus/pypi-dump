    "description": "# autorandr \nAutomatically select a display configuration based on connected devices\n\n## Branch information\n\nThis is a compatible Python rewrite of\n[wertarbyte/autorandr](https://github.com/wertarbyte/autorandr).\n\nThe original [wertarbyte/autorandr](https://github.com/wertarbyte/autorandr)\ntree is unmaintained, with lots of open pull requests and issues. I forked it\nand merged what I thought were the most important changes. If you are searching\nfor that version, see the [`legacy` branch](https://github.com/phillipberndt/autorandr/tree/legacy).\nNote that the Python version is better suited for non-standard configurations,\nlike if you use `--transform` or `--reflect`. If you use `auto-disper`, you\nhave to use the bash version, as there is no disper support in the Python\nversion (yet). Both versions use a compatible configuration file format, so\nyou can, to some extent, switch between them.  I will maintain the `legacy`\nbranch until @wertarbyte finds the time to maintain his branch again.\n\nIf you are interested in why there are two versions around, see\n[#7](https://github.com/phillipberndt/autorandr/issues/7),\n[#8](https://github.com/phillipberndt/autorandr/issues/8) and\nespecially\n[#12](https://github.com/phillipberndt/autorandr/issues/12)\nif you are unhappy with this version and would like to contibute to the bash\nversion.\n\n## License information and authors\n\nautorandr is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License\n(version 3).\n\nContributors to this version of autorandr are:\n\n* Alexander Wirt\n* Chris Dunder\n* Daniel Hahler\n* Maciej Sitarz\n* Mathias Svensson\n* Matthew R Johnson\n* Nazar Mokrynskyi\n* Phillip Berndt\n* Rasmus Wriedt Larsen\n* Stefan Tomanek\n* Timo Bingmann\n* Tomasz Bogdal\n* Victor H\u00e4ggqvist\n* stormc\n* tachylatus\n* andersonjacob\n* Simon Wydooghe\n\n## Installation/removal\nYou can use the `autorandr.py` script as a stand-alone binary. If you'd like to\ninstall it as a system-wide application, there is a Makefile included that also\nplaces some configuration files in appropriate directories such that autorandr\nis invoked automatically when a monitor is connected or removed, the system\nwakes up from suspend, or a user logs into an X11 session.\n\nFor Debian-based distributions (including Ubuntu) it is recommended to call\n`make deb` to obtain a package that can be installed and removed with `dpkg`.\n\nOn Arch Linux, there is [an aur package\navailable](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/autorandr-git/).\n\nOn other distributions you can install autorandr by calling `make install` and\nremove it by calling `make uninstall`. Run `make` without arguments to obtain a\nlist of what exactly will be installed.\n\nWe appreciate packaging scripts for other distributions, please file a pull\nrequest if you write one.\n\nIf you prefer `pip` over your package manager, you can install autorandr with:\n\n    sudo pip install \"git+http://github.com/phillipberndt/autorandr#egg=autorandr\"\n\nAutomatically generated packages versions are available from the\n[openSUSE build service](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:phillipberndt/autorandr).\n\n## How to use\n\nSave your current display configuration and setup with:\n\n    autorandr --save mobile\n\nConnect an additional display, configure your setup and save it:\n\n    autorandr --save docked\n\nNow autorandr can detect which hardware setup is active:\n\n    $ autorandr\n      mobile\n      docked (detected)\n\nTo automatically reload your setup, just append `--change` to the command line\n\nTo manually load a profile, you can use the `--load <profile>` option.\n\nautorandr tries to avoid reloading an identical configuration. To force the\n(re)configuration, apply `--force`.\n\nTo prevent a profile from being loaded, place a script call _block_ in its\ndirectory. The script is evaluated before the screen setup is inspected, and\nin case of it returning a value of 0 the profile is skipped. This can be used\nto query the status of a docking station you are about to leave.\n\nIf no suitable profile can be identified, the current configuration is kept.\nTo change this behaviour and switch to a fallback configuration, specify\n`--default <profile>`. The system-wide installation of autorandr by default\ncalls autorandr with a parameter `--default default`. There are three special,\nvirtual configurations called `horizontal`, `vertical` and `common`. They\nautomatically generate a configuration that incorporates all screens\nconnected to the computer. You can symlink `default` to one of these\nnames in your configuration directory to have autorandr use any of them\nas the default configuration without you having to change the system-wide\nconfiguration.\n\nAnother script called `postswitch` can be placed in the directory\n`~/.config/autorandr` (or `~/.autorandr` if you have an old installation) as\nwell as in all profile directories: The scripts are executed after a mode\nswitch has taken place and can notify window managers or other applications\nabout it. The same holds for `preswitch`, which is executed before the switch\ntakes place, and `postsave`, which is executed after a profile was\nstored/altered.\n\nIf you experience issues with xrandr being executed too early after connecting\na new monitor, then you can create a script `predetect`, which will be executed\nbefore autorandr attempts to run xrandr. Place e.g. `sleep 1` into that file\nto make autorandr wait a second before running xrandr.\n\nAll scripts can also be placed in any of the `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS`. In addition to\nthe script names themselves, any executables in subdirectories named\n`script_name.d` (e.g. `postswitch.d`) are executed as well. In scripts, some of\nautorandr's state is exposed as environment variables prefixed with `AUTORANDR_`.\nThe most useful one is `$AUTORANDR_CURRENT_PROFILE`.\n\n## Changelog\n\n* *2017-07-16* Skip `--panning` unless it is required (See #72)\n\n**autorandr 1.1**\n\n* *2017-06-07* Call systemctl with `--no-block` from udev rule (See #61)\n* *2017-01-20* New script hook, `predetect`\n* *2017-01-18* Accept comments (lines starting with `#`) in config/setup files\n\n**autorandr 1.0**\n\n* *2016-12-07* Tag the current code as version 1.0.0; see github issue #54\n* *2016-10-03* Install a desktop file to `/etc/xdg/autostart` by default",
