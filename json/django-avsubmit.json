    "description": "===============\ndjango-avsubmit\n===============\n\ndjango-avsubmit is an application written for Django to allow security response\ngroups (CIRTs, SOCs, etc.) to easily upload and submit malicious code samples\nto antivirus vendors and other security research partners.\n\nThe application supports the following workflow and features:\n\n\nWorkflow\n--------\n\n1. User creates \"submission targets\" as organizations with email addresses to\n   which samples may be submitted.\n2. User uploads malware sample. File properties (size, type, hashes, etc.) are\n   extracted.\n3. User supplies notes/background for sample and selects one or more\n   organizations to whom sample will be submitted. Freeform Cc email addresses\n   may also be specified.\n4. Sample is zipped, encrypted with a password, and emailed to recipients. Each\n   specified recipient receives a copy of the email complete with user's\n   supplied notes.\n5. Submission is logged, capturing time of submission, file name, hash details,\n   file size and type, submitter name, notes supplied about the sample, and the\n   organizations to whom the message was submitted successfully.\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Provides solution to limited authorized submitters as allowed by some\n  \"enterprise\" AV support contracts. Multiple users may submit samples using\n  a single email sender address, while also gaining a standardized process and\n  tracking/collaborative benefits.\n- Calculates file size, file type (using file(1)), and cryptographic hashes:\n  MD5, SHA1, SHA256.\n- Provides a permission for Django's auth framework to control who may submit\n  samples to targets.\n- Provides search interface and paginated output. Search supports searching by\n  supported file hashes, file name and submitter name.\n- Uses by default the standard passphase of \"infected\" (no quotes) for ZIP\n  archives.",
