    "description": "nsdf\n====\n\nNSDF (Neuroscience Simulation Data Format) is a file format built\non top of [HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/).\n\nAlthough the design and development started with the aim of storing\ndata generated from simulations in computational neuroscience, this\nformat is generic enough that any time series data should fit in. Thus\nthe actual application can be much broader than simulations in\nneuroscience.\n\n * NSDF is under development and we welcome feedback and suggestions from\nthe community.\n\n * If you use nsdf for your research, please consider citing the article with NSDF specification:\n \n Ray, Subhasis, Chaitanya Chintaluri, Upinder S. Bhalla, and Daniel K. W\u00f3jcik. 2015. \"NSDF: Neuroscience Simulation Data Format.\" Neuroinformatics, November, 1\u201321. doi:10.1007/s12021-015-9282-5.\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nnsdf module works with h5py 2.3.1. Python 2.7 and numpy. The latest\ndevelopment version should also work with Python 3, but not fully\ntested yet.\n\nTo build the documentation you also need sphinx,\nsphinxcontrib-napoleon packages.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\nTo install from PyPI use: \n\n1. If you have admin rights on a linux and want to install it for all users:\n\n\t`sudo pip install nsdf`\n\n2. If you don't have admin rights or want to install in your home directory\n\n\t`pip install nsdf --user`\n\n\n\nTo install the nsdf package from the source (available at\n\"https://github.com/nsdf/nsdf\"):\n\nOpen a terminal, cd to the top level directory (the one containing\nthis file) and enter:\n\n`python setup.py install`\n\n\nTo build the documentation, cd to doc directory and enter:\n\n`make html`\n\nThis will create \"\\_build\" directory and the index of the docs will be\nin \"\\_build/html/index.html\". Or you can read the latest documentation\nbuilt from git:master branch on nsdf.readthedocs.org.\n\nOther Tools\n-----------\n\n[dataviz](https://github.com/subhacom/dataviz)\nA GUI utility for viewing HDF5 datasets.\n\n[Moogli](https://aviralg.github.io/Moogli/) Coming Soon.\nA Simulator independent visualization tool for neuronal simulations.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nSubhasis Ray, Chaitanya Chintaluri, Upinder Bhalla and Daniel W\u00f3jcik\nhave been designing the specification in collaboration.\n\nChaitanya is providing examples and use cases.\n\nSubhasis is developing this Python module providing a high level API\nfor reading and writing NSDF files.\n\nWe thank Aviral Goel, Johannes Rieke and Matteo Cantarelli for their\ncritical input.\n\nZbigniew J\u0119drzejewski-Szmek contributed to structuring for packaging.",
