If all mails have been processed successfully,\nit will update this date with the latest message received.\n\nSystem administrators need to be attentive to the Odoo logs, looking for errors\nraised during the processing of emails, in order to avoid situations where\nlots of emails are downloaded and reprocessed every time, due to errors found\n in a few old emails that were unattended.\n\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/149/9.0\n\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* This module should not be used together with the OCA module\n  `fetchmail_notify_error_to_sender <https://github.com/OCA/server-tools/tree/9\n  .0/fetchmail_notify_error_to_sender>`_, because this other module sends an\n  email to the author of an email when it could not be processed. And you\n  would be spamming to the original authors every time Odoo tries to\n  re-process the email.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/server-tools/issues>`_. In case of trouble, please\ncheck there if your issue has already been reported. If you spotted it first,\nhelp us smash it by providing detailed and welcomed feedback.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nImages\n------\n\n* Odoo Community Association: `Icon <https://github.com/OCA/maintainer-tools/blob/master/template/module/static/description/icon.svg>`_.\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n* Lorenzo Battistini <lorenzo.battistini@agilebg.com>\n* Alessio Gerace\n* Jordi Ballester <jordi.ballester@eficent.com>\n\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\n\nMaintainer\n----------\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nTo contribute to this module, please visit https://odoo-community.org.\n\n\n",
