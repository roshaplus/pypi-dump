    "description": "TiMemory\n========\n\nC++ and Python Timing + Memory Utilities including auto-timers and\ntemporary memory calculation\n\n`Source code documentation for\nTiMemory <https://jrmadsen.github.io/TiMemory>`__\n\nDependancies\n------------\n\n-  Operating systems\n\n   -  Linux (tested on Ubuntu 14.04)\n   -  macOS (tested on 10.13 - High Sierra)\n   -  Windows support is generally untested\n\n      -  memory measurements may not have correct units if compiles\n\n-  C++\n\n   -  C++11 compiler\n\n      -  Known support for:\n\n         -  GCC (Linux + macOS, 4.9 - 7.2)\n         -  Clang (Linux + macOS, 4.0, 5.0)\n         -  Intel (Linux, 18.0.1)\n\n   -  MPI (optional)\n   -  cereal (git submodule)\n   -  pybind11 (git submodule)\n\n-  Python\n\n   -  version >= 2.6\n   -  packages\n\n      -  argparse\n      -  numpy\n      -  matplotlib\n      -  unittest\n\nPython setup.py installation\n----------------------------\n\n::\n\n  # with MPI\n  python setup.py build install\n  # without MPI\n  python setup.py config --disable-mpi build install\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nThere are essentially two components of the output:\n\n-  a text file (e.g. ``timing_report_XXX.out`` file)\n\n   -  general ASCII report\n\n-  a JSON file with more detailed data\n\n   -  used for plotting purposes\n   -  can be directly called by module:\n      ``timemory.util.plot([\"output.json\"], display=False)``\n   -  ``python/plot.py`` in the source tree can be directly used\n\n-  Implementation uses \u201cauto-timers\u201d. Essentially, at the beginning of a\n   function, you create a timer.\n-  The timer starts automatically and when the timer is \u201cdestroyed\u201d,\n   i.e. goes out of scope at the end of the function, it stops the timer\n   and records the time difference and also some memory measurements.\n-  The way the auto-timers are setup is that they will automatically\n   record the name of the function they were created in.\n-  Additional info is sometimes added when you have similar function\n   names, for example, a python ``__init__`` function will want to\n   create an auto-timer that provides the class the function is being\n   called from, e.g.\n   ``autotimer = timemory.auto_timer(type(self).__name__)``\n-  All this info will show up with an ensuing \u201c@\u2018 tag on the end of the\n   function name. Other options are the name of the file, etc.\n\n   -  ``timemory.FILE(nback=2)``\n   -  ``'{}'.format(timemory.LINE(nback=1))``\n   -  ``timemory.FUNC(nback=1)``\n   -  ``t = timemory.timer('{}@{}:{}'.format(timemory.FUNC(), timemory.FILE(), timemory.LINE()))``\n   -  where \"nback\" is a parameter specifying how far back in the call\n      tree\n\nExample\n-------\n\nFor the interpretation of text output, here is an example and the\nexplanation of it\u2019s structure\n\n::\n\n  > rank 0\n  |0> [pyc] main@'toast_ground_sim_simple.py'            : 41.104 wall, 69.150 user +  4.690 system = 73.840 CPU [sec] (179.6%) : RSS {tot,self}_{curr,peak} : (1146.5|2232.7) | (1072.4|2158.6) [MB]\n  |0> [pyc] |_create_observations                        :  5.047 wall,  5.060 user +  0.060 system =  5.120 CPU [sec] (101.4%) : RSS {tot,self}_{curr,peak} : ( 110.3| 122.3) | (  35.8|  47.8) [MB]\n  |0> [pyc]   |___init__@TODGround                       :  5.041 wall,  5.040 user +  0.060 system =  5.100 CPU [sec] (101.2%) : RSS {tot,self}_{curr,peak} : ( 122.2| 122.3) | (   9.3|   9.4) [MB] (total #

If each thread ran a calculation\n      that calculated 4 values with a single CPU instruction (SIMD), we\n      would have a speed up of 16x (4 threads x 4 values at one time ==\n      16x)\n\n-  Relative time (i.e. self-cost) for a function at a certain indent\n   level (i.e. indented with ``2\\*level`` spaces from [pyc]/[cxx]) can\n   be calculated from the function(s) at ``level+1`` until you reach\n   another function at the same level\n-  This is better understood by an example\n\n   -  function A is the main (it is \u201clevel 0\u201d) and takes 35 seconds\n   -  function B is called from main (it is \"level 1\u201d)\n   -  function C is called from main (it is \u201clevel 1\u201d)\n   -  function B does some calculations and calls function D (it is\n      \u201clevel 2\u201d) five times (e.g. a loop calling function D)\n   -  function B takes 20 seconds\n   -  function D, called from B, takes a total of 10 seconds (which is\n      what is reported). The average time of function D is thus 2\n      seconds (10 sec / 5 laps)\n   -  function C does some calculations and also calls function D (again\n      \u201clevel 2\u201d) five times\n   -  The call to function D from function C will be reported as\n      separate from the calls to D from B thanks to a hashing technique\n      we use to identify function calls originating from different call\n      trees/sequences\n   -  function C takes 9 seconds\n   -  function D, called from C, takes a total of 8 seconds (avg. of 1.6\n      seconds)\n   -  Thus we know that function B required 10 seconds of compute time\n      by subtracting out the time spent in its calls to function D\n   -  We know that function C required 1 second of compute time by\n      subtracting out the time spent in it\u2019s calls to function D\n   -  We can subtract the time from function B and C to calculate the\n      \u201cself-cost\u201d in function A (35 - 20 - 9 = 6 seconds)\n\n      -  When calculating the self-cost of A, one does not subtract the\n         time spent in function D. These times are included in the\n         timing of both B and C\n\nMEMORY FIELDS\n-------------\n\n-  The memory measurements are a bit confusing, admittedly. The two\n   types \"curr\" (\"current\", which I will refer to as such from here on\n   out) and \"peak\" have to do with different memory measurements\n\n   -  They are both \"RSS\" measurements, which stand for \"resident set\n      size\". This is the amount of physical memory in RAM that is\n      currently private to the process\n\n      -  It does not include the \"swap\" memory, which is when the OS\n         puts memory not currently being used onto the hard drive\n      -  Typical Linux implementations will start using swap when ~60%\n         of your RAM is full (you can override this easily in Linux by\n         switching the \u201cswapiness\u201d to say, 90% for better performance\n         since swap is slower than RAM)\n\n-  All memory measurements with \u201claps\u201d > 0, are the max memory\n   measurement of each \"lap\"\n\n   -  The \u201ccurrent\u201d and \u201cpeak\u201d max measurements are computed\n      independently\n   -  E.g. the \u201ccurrent\u201d max doesn\u2019t directly correspond to the \u201cpeak\u201d\n      max \u2014 one \u201clap\u201d may record the largest \u201ccurrent\u201d RSS measurement\n      but that does not (necessarily) mean that the same \u201clap\u201d is\n      responsible for the max \u201cpeak\u201d RSS measurement\n   -  This is due to our belief that the max values are the ones of\n      interest \u2014 the instances we must guard against to avoid running\n      out of memory\n\n-  With respect to \u201ctotal\u201d vs. \u201cself\u201d, this is fairly straightforward\n\n   -  For the \u201ctotal\u201d, I simply take a measurement of the memory usage\n      at the destruction of the timer\n   -  The \u201cself\u201d measurement is the difference in the memory\n      measurements between the creation of the auto-timer and when it is\n      destroyed\n   -  The \"total\" memory at the start of the timer can be determined\n      from the memory measurement of the timer one level higher up the\n      call tree or by ``\"total\" - \"self\"``\n\n      -  This measurement shows is how much persistent memory was\n         created in the function\n      -  It is valuable primarily as a metric to see how much memory is\n         being created in the function and returned to the calling\n         function\n      -  For example, if function X called function Y and function Y\n         allocated 10 MB of memory and returned an object using this\n         memory to function X, you would see function Y have a\n         \u201cself-cost\u201d of 10 MB in memory\n\n-  The difference between \u201ccurrent\u201d and \u201cpeak\u201d is how the memory is\n   measured\n\n   -  The \u201cpeak\u201d value is what the OS reports as the max amount of\n      memory being used is\n   -  I find this to be slightly more informative than \u201ccurrent\u201d which\n      is measurement of the \u201cpages\u201d allocated in memory\n   -  The reason \"current\" is included is because of the following:\n\n      -  Essentially, a \u201cpage\u201d of memory can be thought of as street\n         addresses separated into \u201cblocks\u201d, i.e. 1242 MLK Blvd. is in\n         the 1200 block of MLK Blvd.\n      -  A \u201cpage\u201d is thus similar to a \u201cblock\u201d \u2014 it is a starting memory\n         address\n      -  The size of the pages is defined by the OS and just like the\n         \u201cswappiness\u201d, it can be modified\n      -  For example, the default page size may be 1 KB and when a\n         process has memory allocation need for 5.5 KB, the OS will\n         provide 6 \u201cpages\u201d\n\n         -  This is why one will see performance improvements when\n            dealing with certain applications that application require\n            large contiguous memory blocks, larger \u201cpages\u201d require fewer\n            page requests and fewer reallocations to different pages\n            when more memory is requested for an existing object with\n            contiguous memory)\n\n      -  Within the page itself, the entire page might be used or it\n         might not be fully used\n      -  When a page is not entirely used, you will get a \u201ccurrent\u201d RSS\n         usage greater than the \u201cpeak\u201d memory usage \u2014 the memory is\n         reserved for the process but is not actually used so it is thus\n         not contained in the \u201cpeak\u201d RSS usage number\n      -  However, when several pages is requested and allocated within a\n         function but then released when returning to the calling\n         function (i.e. temporary/transient page usage), you will have a\n         \u201cpeak\u201d RSS exceeding the \u201ccurrent\u201d RSS memory usage since the\n         \u201ccurrent\u201d is measured after the pages are released back to the\n         OS\n      -  Thus, with these two numbers, one can then deduce how much\n         temporary/transient memory usage is being allocated in the\n         function \u2014 if a function reports a self-cost of 243.2 MB of\n         \u201ccurrent\u201d RSS and a \u201cpeak\u201d RSS of 403.9 MB, then you know that\n         the \u201cbuild\\_npp\u201d function created 243.2 MB of persistent memory\n         but creating the object requiring the persistent 243.2 MB\n         required an additional 160.7 MB of temporary/transient memory\n         (403.9 MB - 243.2 MB).\n\nUSING AUTO-TIMERS\n-----------------\n\nIf you have new Python code you would like to use the auto-timers with,\nhere is general guide:\n\n-  Import the timing module (obvious, I guess)\n-  Always add the auto-timer at the very beginning of the function.\n\n   -  You can use an variable name you wish but make sure it is a named\n      variable (e.g. ``autotimer = timemory.auto_timer()``, not\n      ``timemory.auto_timer()``)\n   -  The auto-timer functionality requires the variable to exist for\n      the scope of the function\n\n-  Alternatively, use the auto\\_timer decorator in timemory.utils\n\n   -  However, this decorator does not work well for recursive functions\n\n-  For free-standing function without any name conflicts, just add:\n   ``autotimer = timemory.auto_timer()``\n-  For functions within a class, add:\n   ``autotimer = timemory.auto_timer(type(self).__name__)``\n-  For the primary auto-timer, use:\n   ``autotimer = timemory.auto_timer(timemory.FILE())`` \u2014 this will tag\n   \u201cmain\u201d with the python file name\n-  In some instances, you may want to include the directory of the\n   filename, for this use:\n   ``autotimer = timemory.auto_timer(timemory.FILE(use_dirname = True))``\n-  Add ``tman = timemory.timing_manager() ; tman.report()`` at the end\n   of your main file.\n\n   -  It is generally recommended to do this in a different scope than\n      the primary autotimer but not necessary.\n   -  Some control options are available with:\n      ``tim.util.add_arguments_and_parse(parser)`` in Python\n   -  In other words, put all your work in a \u201cmain()\u201d function looking\n      like this:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  #!/usr/bin/env python\n\n  import timemory\n\n  # optional (will catch SIGINT + other signals such as SIGABRT, SIGQUIT, SIGHUP, etc.)\n  timemory.enable_signal_detection()\n\n  # ...\n\n\n  #------------------------------------------------------------------------------#\n  # use a decorator\n  @timemory.util.auto_timer(key = \"\", add_args=True)\n  def decorator_func(args):\n      # ...\n      import time\n      time.sleep(1)\n\n\n  #------------------------------------------------------------------------------#\n  def main(args):\n      # this will be the top-level timer in timing + memory report because it is\n      # the first added\n      autotimer = timemory.auto_timer()\n      # ...\n      decorator_func(args)\n      # ...\n\n\n  #------------------------------------------------------------------------------#\n  if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n      import argparse\n      parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n      parser.add_argument(\"-s\", \"--size\",\n                          help=\"Size of array allocations\",\n                          default=10, type=int)\n      # ...\n      args = timemory.util.add_arguments_and_parse(parser)\n\n      timemory.util.opts.set_report(timemory.util.opts.report_fname)\n      timemory.util.opts.set_serial(timemory.util.opts.serial_fname)\n\n      try:\n          main(args)\n\n          # get the handle for the timing manager\n          timing_manager = timemory.timing_manager()\n\n          # will output to stdout if \"set_report\" not called\n          timing_manager.report()\n\n          # serialization will be called in above if \"set_serial\" is called\n          # but to serialize to file:\n          timing_manager.serialize('output.json')\n\n          # get the serialization directly\n          json_objs = [ timemory.util.read(timing_manager.json()) ]\n          print (json_objs[0])\n\n          # get the serialization file ('output.json')\n          json_files = [ timemory.util.opts.serial_fname ]\n\n          # will create timing and memory plot with avg + err for files\n          # (even though output is identical in this example...)\n          timemory.util.plot(json_objs, files=json_files, display=False)\n\n      except Exception as e:\n          print (e)\n          print (\"Error! Unable to plot 'output.json'\")\n\n      print ('')",
