    "description": "## Smother\n\n![logo](docs/_static/smother.png)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ChrisBeaumont/smother.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ChrisBeaumont/smother)\n\nSmother is a wrapper utility around [coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.1/) that measures code coverage\nseparately for each test in a test suite. Its main features include:\n\n * Fast and reliable coverage tracking using [coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.1/).\n * Ability to lookup which tests visit an arbitrary section of your application code.\n * Ability to convert version control diffs into a subset of affected tests to rerun.\n\n## Demo\n\nSmother contains plugins for nose and pytest, and behaves similarly to coverage.py:\n\n```\npy.test --smother=my_module test_suite/\nor\nnosetests --with-smother --smother-package=my_module test_suite/\n```\n\nThese commands create a `.smother` file that can be queried by the `smother` CLI\n\n```\nsmother lookup foo.bar          # which tests visited module foo.bar?\nsmother lookup foo.bar:120-122  # or just some lines in that file?\nsmother lookup foo.bar:baz      # or just the `baz` function?\n\nsmother diff                    # given local modifications to my repo, what tests might have broken?\nsmother diff | xargs py.test    # just run them!\n\nsmother to_coverage             # build a vanilla .coverage file from a .smother file\nsmother csv test.csv            # dump all (application, test) pairs to a file\n```\n\n## Why?\n\nSmother was designed to make it easier to work with legacy codebases. Such codebases often have several properties that make rapid iteration difficult:\n\n * **Long-running test suites.** The initial codebase that smother was designed for took nearly 24 hours of CPU time to run its 11K tests. `smother diff` makes it easier to select a (hopefully much) smaller subset of\n tests to re-run to quickly identify possible regressions.\n * **Many different subsystems** -- most of which any single developer is unfamiliar with. `smother lookup` can be used to explore how and where particular modules are invoked in a test suite. These tests often reveal implicit contracts about code behavior that are not obvious from documentation alone.\n * **Scope creep**. Over time the abstractions in codebases become leakier,\n and logic between different subsystems becomes more heavily coupled. `smother csv` catalogs the coupling between source code units (lines, functions, or classes) and tests. Exploring this data often yields insights about\n which subsystems are well-encapsulated, and which would benefit from refactoring.\n\n## Full Documentation\n\n[Read the Docs](http://smother.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
