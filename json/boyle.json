    "description": ".. -*- mode: rst -*-\n\nboyle\n=====\n\nMedical Image Conversion and Input/Output Tools\n\nNamed after Robert Boyle (1627-1691), known as the first modern chemist, although he believed in the transmutation of metals to be a possibility following the alchemical tradition.\n\n.. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/neurita/boyle.png?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/neurita/boyle\n\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/neurita/boyle/badge.png\n    :target: https://coveralls.io/r/neurita/boyle\n\n\nDependencies\n============\n\nPlease see the requirements.txt and pip_requirements.txt file.\n\nInstall\n=======\n\nThis package uses setuptools and Makefiles. \n\nI've made a workaround to deal with build dependencies of some requirements.\nSo there are two requirements files: requirements.txt and pip-requirements.txt.\nThe requirements.txt dependencies must be installed one by one, with::\n\n    make install_deps\n\nThe following command will install everything with all dependencies::\n\n    make install\n    \nIf you already have the dependencies listed in requirements.txt installed, \nto install in your home directory, use::\n\n    python setup.py install --user\n\nTo install for all users on Unix/Linux::\n\n    python setup.py build\n    sudo python setup.py install\n\nYou can also install it in development mode with::\n\n    make develop\n\n\nDevelopment\n===========\n\nCode\n----\n\nGithub\n~~~~~~\n\nYou can check the latest sources with the command::\n\n    git clone https://www.github.com/neurita/boyle.git\n\nor if you have write privileges::\n\n    git clone git@github.com:neurita/boyle.git\n\nIf you are going to create patches for this project, create a branch for it \nfrom the master branch.\n\nThe stable releases are tagged in the repository.\n\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nTODO",
