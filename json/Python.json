    "description": "Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming\nlanguage. It is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java.\n\nPython combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has\nmodules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and\ndynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and\nlibraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk,\nMac, MFC). New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++. Python\nis also usable as an extension language for applications that need a\nprogrammable interface.\n\nThe Python implementation is portable: it runs on many brands of UNIX,\non Windows, DOS, OS/2, Mac, Amiga... If your favorite system isn't\nlisted here, it may still be supported, if there's a C compiler for\nit. Ask around on comp.lang.python -- or just try compiling Python\nyourself.",
