    "description": "[![safety](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyupio/safety-db/master/safety-db.png)](https://pyup.io/safety/)\n\n## What is Safety DB?\n\nSafety DB is a database of known security vulnerabilities in Python packages. The data is made available by [pyup.io](https://pyup.io/) and synced with this repository once per month. Most of the entries are found by filtering CVEs and changelogs for certain keywords and then manually reviewing them.\n\n## Tools\n\n- [Safety CI](https://pyup.io/safety/ci/) is a deep GitHub integration that's available on pyup.io. It checks your commits and Pull Requests.\n- [Safety](https://pyup.io/safety/) is a command line tool that checks virtualenvironments and requirement files either locally or on a CI server. \n- [Safety Django](https://pyup.io/safety/django/) is a package for Django that warns you in the admin area if your installed Django release is insecure.\n- [Safety Bar](https://github.com/pyupio/safety-bar) (alpha) is a macOS menubar application.\n- A [pre-commit hook](https://github.com/Lucas-C/pre-commit-hooks-safety) by Lucas Cimon.\n- *your tool?*\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\n\npip install safety-db\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```python\n\nfrom safety_db import INSECURE, INSECURE_FULL\n```\n\n## What is this not?\n\nThis is not a hall of shame, or a list of packages to avoid. The package maintainers show a great responsibility by documenting and fixing security issues in such a way that they can be listed here. That's extremely valuable when considering using a package in production.\n\n## Using this data\n\nFor humans:\n\n- There's a small website available that lets you browse the data: https://pyupio.github.io/safety-db/\n\nFor robots:\n\nCheck out the `data` directory:\n\n- [insecure.json](https://github.com/pyupio/safety-db/blob/master/data/insecure.json) contains just the package name and all insecure releases as a plain list.\n- [insecure_full.json](https://github.com/pyupio/safety-db/blob/master/data/insecure_full.json) additionally contains the CVE description and URLs, or the relevant part of the changelog.\n\nThe database is licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). This allows you to use the data in any non commercial project as long as you link back to this repo. If you need a license for a commercial project, please contact support@pyup.io.\n",
