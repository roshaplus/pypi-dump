    "description": "PyRuSH\n\nPyRuSH is the python implementation of RuSH, which is orginally developed using Java. RuSH is an efficient, reliable, and easy adaptable rule-based sentence segmentation solution. It is specifically designed to handle the telegraphic written text in clinical note. It leverages a nested hash table to execute simultaneous rule processing, which reduces the impact of the rule-base growth on execution time and eliminates the effect of rule order on accuracy.\n\nIf you wish to cite RuSH in a publication, please use:\n\nJianlin Shi ; Danielle Mowery ; Kristina M. Doing-Harris ; John F. Hurdle.RuSH: a Rule-based Segmentation Tool Using Hashing for Extremely Accurate Sentence Segmentation of Clinical Text.
