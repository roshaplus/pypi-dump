    "description": "psd-tools2\n==========\n\nThis is a fork of psd-tools_ that\nadds a couple of enhancements to the original version.\n\n``psd-tools2`` is a package for reading Adobe Photoshop PSD files\n(as described in specification_) to Python data structures.\n\n.. _specification: https://www.adobe.com/devnet-apps/photoshop/fileformatashtml/PhotoshopFileFormats.htm\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/psd-tools2.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psd-tools2\n   :alt: PyPI Version\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/travis/kyamagu/psd-tools/master.svg\n   :alt: Build Status\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/kyamagu/psd-tools\n\n.. _psd-tools: https://github.com/psd-tools/psd-tools\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n::\n\n    pip install psd-tools2\n\nPillow_ should be installed if you want work with PSD image and layer data:\nexport images to PNG, process them. PIL_ library should also work.\n\n::\n\n   pip install Pillow\n\n.. note::\n\n    In order to extract images from 32bit PSD files PIL/Pillow must be built\n    with LITTLECMS or LITTLECMS2 support.\n\npsd-tools2 also has a rudimentary support for Pymaging_.\n`Pymaging installation instructions`_ are available in pymaging docs.\n\n.. _PIL: http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/\n.. _Pillow: https://github.com/python-imaging/Pillow\n.. _packbits: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/packbits/\n.. _Pymaging: https://github.com/ojii/pymaging\n.. _Pymaging installation instructions: http://pymaging.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usr/installation.html\n.. _exifread: https://github.com/ianare/exif-py\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nLoad an image::\n\n    >>> from psd_tools import PSDImage\n    >>> psd = PSDImage.load('my_image.psd')\n\nRead image header::\n\n    >>> psd.header\n    PsdHeader(number_of_channels=3, height=200, width=100, depth=8, color_mode=RGB)\n\nAccess its layers::\n\n    >>> psd.layers\n    [<psd_tools.Group: 'Group 2', layer_count=1>,\n     <psd_tools.Group: 'Group 1', layer_count=1>,\n     <psd_tools.Layer: 'Background', size=100x200, x=0, y=0>]\n\nWork with a layer group::\n\n    >>> group2 = psd.layers[0]\n    >>> group2.name\n    Group 2\n\n    >>> group2.visible\n    True\n\n    >>> group2.closed\n    False\n\n    >>> group2.opacity\n    255\n\n    >>> from psd_tools.constants import BlendMode\n    >>> group2.blend_mode == BlendMode.NORMAL\n    True\n\n    >>> group2.layers\n    [<psd_tools.Layer: 'Shape 2', size=43x62, x=40, y=72)>]\n\nWork with a layer::\n\n    >>> layer = group2.layers[0]\n    >>> layer.name\n    Shape 2\n\n    >>> layer.bbox\n    BBox(x1=40, y1=72, x2=83, y2=134)\n\n    >>> layer.bbox.width, layer.bbox.height\n    (43, 62)\n\n    >>> layer.visible, layer.opacity, layer.blend_mode\n    (True, 255, u'norm')\n\n    >>> layer.text_data.text\n    'Text inside a text box'\n\n    >>> layer.as_PIL()\n    <PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGBA size=43x62 at ...>\n\n    >>> layer.mask_data.bbox\n    BBox(x1=40, y1=72, x2=83, y2=134)\n\n    >>> layer.mask_data.as_PIL()\n    <PIL.Image.Image image mode=L size=43x62 at ...>\n\nExport a single layer::\n\n    >>> layer_image = layer.as_PIL()\n    >>> layer_image.save('layer.png')\n\nExport the merged image::\n\n    >>> merged_image = psd.as_PIL()\n    >>> merged_image.save('my_image.png')\n\nThe same using Pymaging_::\n\n    >>> merged_image = psd.as_pymaging()\n    >>> merged_image.save_to_path('my_image.png')\n    >>> layer_image = layer.as_pymaging()\n    >>> layer_image.save_to_path('layer.png')\n\nExport layer group (experimental)::\n\n    >>> group_image = group2.as_PIL()\n    >>> group_image.save('group.png')\n\nGet pattern dict::\n\n    >>> psd.patterns\n    {'b2fdfd29-de85-11d5-838b-ff55e75fb875': <psd_tools.Pattern: size=265x219 ...>}\n\n\nWhy yet another PSD reader?\n---------------------------\n\nThere are existing PSD readers for Python:\n\n* psdparse_;\n* pypsd_;\n* there is a PSD reader in PIL_ library;\n* it is possible to write Python plugins for GIMP_.\n\nPSD reader in PIL is incomplete and contributing to PIL\nis complicated because of the slow release process, but the main issue\nwith PIL for me is that PIL doesn't have an API for layer groups.\n\nGIMP is cool, but it is a huge dependency, its PSD parser\nis not perfect and it is not easy to use GIMP Python plugin\nfrom *your* code.\n\nI also considered contributing to pypsd or psdparse, but they are\nGPL and I was not totally satisfied with the interface and the code\n(they are really fine, that's me having specific style requirements).\n\nSo I finally decided to roll out yet another implementation\nthat should be MIT-licensed, systematically based on the specification_\n(it turns out the specs are incomplete and sometimes incorrect though);\nparser should be implemented as a set of functions; the package should\nhave tests and support both Python 2.x and Python 3.x.\n\n.. _GIMP: http://www.gimp.org/\n.. _psdparse: https://github.com/jerem/psdparse\n.. _pypsd: https://code.google.com/p/pypsd\n\n\nDesign overview\n---------------\n\nThe process of handling a PSD file is split into 3 stages:\n\n1) \"Reading\": the file is read and parsed to low-level data\n   structures that closely match the specification. No user-accessible\n   images are constructed; image resources blocks and additional layer\n   information are extracted but not parsed (they remain just keys\n   with a binary data). The goal is to extract all information\n   from a PSD file.\n\n2) \"Decoding\": image resource blocks and additional layer\n   information blocks are parsed to a more detailed data structures\n   (that are still based on a specification). There are a lot of PSD\n   data types and the library currently doesn't handle them all, but\n   it should be easy to add the parsing code for the missing PSD data\n   structures if needed.\n\nAfter (1) and (2) we have an in-memory data structure that closely\nresembles PSD file; it should be fairly complete but very low-level\nand not easy to use. So there is a third stage:\n\n3) \"User-facing API\": PSD image is converted to an user-friendly object\n   that supports layer groups, exporting data as ``PIL.Image`` or\n   ``pymaging.Image``, etc.\n\nStage separation also means user-facing API may be opinionated:\nif somebody doesn't like it then it should possible to build an\nanother API based on lower-level decoded PSD file.\n\n``psd-tools2`` tries not to throw away information from the original\nPSD file; even if the library can't parse some info, this info\nwill be likely available somewhere as raw bytes (open a bug if this is\nnot the case). This should make it possible to modify and write PSD\nfiles (currently not implemented; contributions are welcome).\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nSupported:\n\n* reading of RGB, RGBA, CMYK, CMYKA and Grayscale images;\n* 8bit, 16bit and 32bit channels;\n* all PSD compression methods are supported (not only the most\n  common RAW and RLE);\n* image ICC profile is taken into account;\n* many image resource types and tagged block types are decoded;\n* layer effects information is decoded;\n* Descriptor structures are decoded;\n* there is an optional Cython extension to make the parsing fast;\n* very basic & experimental layer merging;\n* support both PSD and PSB file formats;\n* EngineData structure is decoded;\n* EXIF data is taken into account;\n* experimental JSON export (only Python 3).\n\nNot implemented:\n\n* reading of Duotone, LAB, etc. images;\n* some image resource types and tagged blocks are not decoded\n  (they are attached to the result as raw bytes);\n* some of the raw Descriptor values are not decoded;\n* this library can't reliably blend layers together: it is possible to export\n  a single layer and to export a final image, but rendering of\n  e.g. layer group may produce incorrect results;\n* the writing of PSD images is not implemented;\n* Pymaging_ support is limited: it only supports 8bit RGB/RGBA\n  images, ICC profiles are not applied, layer merging doesn't work, etc.\n\nIf you need some of unimplemented features then please file an issue\nor implement it yourself (pull requests are welcome in this case).\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nDevelopment happens at github: `source code <https://github.com/kyamagu/psd-tools>`__,\n`bug tracker <https://github.com/kyamagu/psd-tools/issues>`__.\nFeel free to submit ideas, bugs or pull requests.\n\nIn case of bugs it would be helpful to provide a small PSD file\ndemonstrating the issue; this file may be added to a test suite.\n\nIn order to run tests, make sure PIL/Pillow is built with LittleCMS\nor LittleCMS2 support, install `tox <http://tox.testrun.org>`_ and type\n\n::\n\n    tox\n\nfrom the source checkout.\n\nThe license is MIT.\n\nAcknowledgments\n---------------\n\nGreat thanks to the original `psd-tools` author Mikhail Korobov.\nA full list of contributors can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/kyamagu/psd-tools/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt\n\n\n1.5 (2017-07-13)\n----------------\n\n- implemented many decodings of image resources and tagged blocks;\n- implemented EngineData text information;\n- user API for getting mask and patterns;\n- user API to calculate bbox for shape layers;\n\n1.4 (2017-01-02)\n----------------\n\n- Fixed reading of layer mask data (thanks Evgeny Kopylov);\n- Python 2.6 support is dropped;\n- Python 3.6 support is added (thanks Leendert Brouwer);\n- extension is rebuilt with Cython 0.25.2.\n\n1.3 (2016-01-25)\n----------------\n\n- fixed references decoding (thanks Josh Drake);\n- fixed PIL support for CMYK files (thanks Michael Wu);\n- optional C extension is rebuilt with Cython 0.23.4;\n- Python 3.2 support is dropped;
