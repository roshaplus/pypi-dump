    "description": "Re-send captured emails using SMTP\n==================================\n\nThis tool, 'mailreplay', is intended to help in testing email pipelines by\nreading captured emails from files, figuring out the sender and recipient, and\nre-injecting them to localhost:25 using SMTP. (If the captured emails have a\nfinal recipient on a different system than localhost, you need to make sure\nthat the MTA is blocked from sending the emails out into the world during\ntesting.)\n\nAn initial envelope From line is used as the sender, if available. Otherwise,\nthe email header From: field is used. The email header Received: fields are\nused to figure out the envelope recipient.\n\nMany other tools exist that will read an an email from file and send it using\nSMTP, but they all seem to have in common that they need to be given the\nrecipient address on the command line, and by default will use the logged-in\nuser as the sender address. For email pipline testing purposes, when a varied\nset of senders and recipients are desired, this doesn't scale easily, hence\nthis tool.\n\nChangelog\n=========\n",
