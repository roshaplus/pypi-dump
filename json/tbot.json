    "description": "tbot\n====\n\n*A library to make writing IRC bots easier and more fun*\n\nRationale\n---------\n\nWriting IRC bots is easy enough that beginners often pull it off to some\nsuccess. But writing extensible, maintainable, IRC bots that are abstracted\nfrom the details of the protocol is difficult. ``twisted.words.protocols.irc``\nmakes that a wee bit easier, but you still need to deal with some things you\nprobably don't care about, like 'factories' or 'protocols' and such things.\nThere are also some harder problems like persistence of state, configuration,\nand module reloading that don't have obvious solutions.\n\n``tbot`` tries to make that simpler, letting you focus on what you care about:\ndoing cool things in IRC.",
