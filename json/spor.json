    "description": "|Python version| |Build Status|\n\n======\n spor\n======\n\nA system for anchoring metadata in external files to source code.\n\nspor lets you define metadata for elements of your source code. The\nmetadata is kept in a separate file from your source code, meaning that\nyou don't need to clutter your source file with extra information\nencoded into comments. To accomplish this while dealing with the fact\nthat source code changes over time, spor uses various \"anchoring\"\ntechniques to keep the metadata in sync with the source code (or let you\nknow when they become unmanageably out of sync).\n\nMotivation\n==========\n\nMy main motivation for this tool comes from my work on the mutation\ntesting tool `Cosmic Ray <https://github.com/sixty-north/cosmic-ray>`__.\nCR users need to be able to specify sections of their source code which\nshould not be mutated, or which should only be mutated in specific ways.\nRather than having them embed these processing directives in the source\ncode, I thought it would be cleaner and neater to let them do so with a\nseparate metadata file.\n\nFeatures\n========\n\nspor needs support for the following functionality:\n\n1. Add/edit/delete metadata to a specific range of text in a source file\n2. Query existing metadata\n3. Automatically update metadata when possible, or report errors when\n   not\n4. Provide facilities facilities for \"updating\" metadata with new\n   anchoring data\n\nThe design needs to be sensitive to both human users (i.e. since they\nmay need to manually work with the metadata from time to time) as well\nas programmatic users. I'm sure the design will evolve as we go, so I'm\ngoing to try to keep it simple and explicit at first.\n\nIdeally spor will work on any programming language (and, really, any\ntext document), though its initial target will be Python source code.\n\nTests\n=====\n\nTo run the tests, first install the test dependencies and then use |tox|_:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n  pip install -e .[test]\n  tox\n\nNotes\n=====\n\nThe field of \"anchoring\" is not new, and there's some existing work we\nneed to pay attention to:\n\n- Bielikova, Maria. `\"Metadata Anchoring for Source Code: Robust Location Descriptor Definition, Building and Interpreting\" <https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maria\\_Bielikova/publication/259892218\\_Metadata\\_Anchoring\\_for\\_Source\\_Code\\_Robust\\_Location\\_Descriptor\\_Definition\\_Building\\_and\\_Interpreting/links/560478cb08aeb5718ff00039.pdf>`__\n\n.. |Python version| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/Python_version-3.4+-blue.svg\n   :target: https://www.python.org/\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/abingham/spor.png?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/abingham/spor\n.. |tox| replace:: ``tox``\n.. _tox: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n",
