Stalker is licensed under LGPL v2.1. And Stalker Pyramid is the\r\nPyramid Web App package based on Stalker. Basically it supplies the web\r\ninterfaces to the system. It is also licensed under LGPL v2.1.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n * Designed for animation and VFX Studios.\r\n * It is a Pyramid Web Application.\r\n * Platform independent.\r\n * Default installation handles nearly all the asset and project management \r\n   needs of an animation and vfx studio.\r\n * Customizable with configuration scripts.\r\n * Customizable object model (Stalker Object Model - SOM).\r\n * Uses TaskJuggler as the project planing and tracking backend.\r\n * Can be used with any kind of databases supported by SQLAlchemy.\r\n * Can be connected to all the major 3d animation packages like Maya, Houdini,\r\n   Nuke, XSI, Vue, Blender etc. and any application that has a Python API.\r\n * Can work as a stand-alone application.\r\n\r\nStalker Pyramid is build over these other OpenSource projects:\r\n * Python\r\n * Stalker\r\n * Pyramid\r\n * SQLAlchemy and Alembic\r\n * Jinja2\r\n * TaskJuggler\r\n\r\nSource\r\n======\r\n\r\nThe latest development version is available in `Google Project page of\r\nStalker`_ or can be directly cloned with the following command if you already\r\nhave mercurial installed::\r\n\r\n  hg clone https://stalker-pyramid.googlecode.com/hg/ stalker_pyramid\r\n\r\n.. _Google Project page of Stalker: http://code.google.com/p/stalker-pyramid/\r\n\r\n=======================\r\nStalker Pyramid Changes\r\n=======================\r\n\r\n0.1.0.b1\r\n========\r\n\r\n* **Update:** The Pyramid part of Stalker is moved in to a new package (this\r\n  one).\r\n* **Fix:** Fixed DBSession, it is now configured with ZopeTransactionExtension\r\n  independent of Stalkers own configuration.\r\n* **Fix:** Fixed TimeLog update dialog timing bug.

The only left issue\r\n    is the end date value is not properly shown in the gannt view.\r\n  * Updated the jQueryGannt css's to work with Stalker and Dojo.\r\n  * Colorized the Sunday column in suitable zoom levels. In upcoming releases\r\n    it will use the stalker.models.studio.Studio.working_hours attribute to\r\n    determine if the day/hour is an off day/hour.\r\n  * Disabled editing of date fields.\r\n  * Disabled undo/redo queue for performance test.\r\n  * Fixed vertical overflow in gantt chart.\r\n  * It is now possible to not to align a tasks start to its dependent tasks\r\n    end.\r\n  * jQueryGantt is now using the Task ids coming from Stalker instead of the\r\n    ridiculous rowId.\r\n  * Fixed a lot of issues related with the new data structure, it seems\r\n    everything is working properly right now.\r\n  * Parent Tasks displayed differently than the leaf tasks (on paar with the\r\n    other gantt charts).\r\n  * Gantt chart in User Detail page is now showing the parent tasks of the\r\n    tasks of the user.\r\n  * Now there are two different context menus for container/parent tasks and\r\n    leaf tasks.",
