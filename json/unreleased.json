    "description": "Unreleased\n==========\n\nA script that prints out a Markdown-formatted changelog snippet listing changes\nsince the most recent release of a GitHub repo.\nThe output is a list of closed pull requests since the repo's last release,\nand follows http://keepachangelog.com/ conventions.\nYou can copy the output, paste it into your changelog file, and then edit it.\n\nExample:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n   $ unreleased hypothesis/client\n\n   ****\n   Changes since hypothesis/client v1.24.1:\n\n   Please edit the output below before including it in the change log.\n   See http://keepachangelog.com for further advice.\n\n   Only include changes which are interesting to users of the package or\n   application, and use a description they will be able to understand.\n   ****\n\n   ## [Unreleased]\n\n   ### Changed\n\n   - Multiple frame detection improvements\n     ([#457](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/457)).\n\n   - Adding waitForFrameObserver in frame manipulation tests\n     ([#469](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/469)).\n\n   - Allow \"oauthEnabled\" setting to be overridden in client config\n     ([#470](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/470)).\n\n   - Replace selection tabs with view switcher (feature flagged)\n     ([#465](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/465)).\n\n   - Convert Unicode service & tests to JS\n     ([#475](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/475)).\n\n   - Set the visibleHighlights state for multiple Guests\n     ([#467](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/467)).\n\n   - Frame destruction ([#472](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/pull/472)).\n\nYou can use `xclip <https://github.com/astrand/xclip>`_ to copy the output\ndirectly into your clipboard instead of printing it to the terminal:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n   unreleased hypothesis/client | xclip -selection clipboard -i\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n* Python 3\n* Git\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n   pip install unreleased\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nYour **current working directory must be the working tree** of a local clone\nof the GitHub repo that you're going to print a changelog for. You then provide\nthe GitHub repo name as a command-line argument. For example to print changes\nfor https://github.com/hypothesis/client since the most recent release,\n``cd`` into your local https://github.com/hypothesis/client repo and run:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n   unreleased hypothesis/client\n\nTo print changes since version ``v1.24.1`` instead, run:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n   unreleased hypothesis/client --tag v1.24.1\n\nThe version should be the name of a `GitHub release <https://help.github.com/articles/about-releases/>`_\nof the repo.\n\nFor more options see ``unreleased --help``.\n\nHacking\n-------\n\nHow to release a new version of unreleased\n##########################################\n\nYou will need:\n\n* A https://pypi.python.org/ account that has the necessary permissions on\n  `the PyPI package for unreleased <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unreleased>`_\n* A `.pypirc file <https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/packageindex.html#pypirc>`_\n  containing your PyPI account credentials\n* `Twine <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine>`_\n\nTo publish a new release:\n\n1. Commit your new changes to git\n\n2. Increment the version number in `version.py <https://github.com/hypothesis/unreleased/blob/master/unreleased/version.py>`_\n\n3. Commit the version number change: ``git commit unreleased/version.py -m \"Bump version number\"``\n\n4. Build the source and binary releases:\n\n   .. code:: sh\n\n      python setup.py sdist\n      python setup.py bdist_wheel\n\n5. Upload the releases to PyPI:\n\n   .. code:: sh\n\n      twine upload dist/*\n\n6. That's it! `The PyPI package page <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unreleased>`_\n   should now show your new version, and existing users can upgrade to it by\n   running ``pip install --upgrade unreleased``.",
