    "description": "HomEvenT is a scripted event handler, originally intended for home automation.\r\nNeedless to say, it *can* be used for other things.\r\n\r\nHomEvenT features a roughly-Pythonic scripting language (with simple syntax,\r\nand prioritized event handlers instead of function calls), numerous modules for\r\nadditional features and I/O, extensive logging, and easy integration into\r\nexisting systems.\r\n\r\nIt is based on Twisted.",
