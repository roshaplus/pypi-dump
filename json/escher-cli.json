    "description": "Escher (``escher-cli``), a command line utility that runs your script with arguments load from a Yaml file\n==========================================================================================================\n\n\ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udca5\\ **Now ``Escher`` supports launching workers on AWS!** \ud83c\udf1f \u2728 \u26a1\ufe0f\n\nInstall and Usage\n-----------------\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    pip install escher-cli\n    escher init  .escher\n    escherd  # this launches the server via a daemon\n    escher --config-file experiment.yml\n\n``Escher`` is a command line utility for your experiments. It manages\nconcurrent runs, command line arguments and other stuff nicely for you!\n\nThe things it manages include:\n\n-  generating run-specific variables, like ``{time}`` and ``{cwd}`` that\n   you can access as template keys in your string.\n-  maximum numbers of concurrent runs (via python ``multiprocess.Pool``)\n-  environment variables (env) such as ``DISPLAY=:1``. You can also\n   passing a file\n-  **default arguments**\n-  **batch arguments** for multiple experiments\n-  **pre-launch** scripts that is ran only once for each batch\n-  **at-launch** script that is run at the launch time of each\n   experiment\n-  **post-launch** script that is as soon as each experiment launches\n-  **post-run** scripts that happens after each experiment is done.\n\n``Escher`` works with all of your current work flow and it doesn't lock\nyou into a specific way of doing things. You still get to use bash\nscripts or Makefile's.\n\nWhy do we use YAML (with JSON planned as well)? My bash script is just fine!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBecause YAML(and json) are human **and** machine readable whereas bash\narguments are **not**. When is the last time you looked at a bash script\nlooking for hyper-parameters, only to realized that some key parameters\nare missing? With ``Escher`` you won't have this problem. You can save\nall of the past and current runs as nicely readable YAML files(or json,\nHjson Cson if you speak coffee script, whatever).\n\n-  if you are writing a report, you can include these YAML/json/cson\n   files directly into markdown or latex.\n-  To see what you ran last night, you can ``glob`` all of the\n   configurations with ``runs/**/experiment.yml`` and make nice tables\n   in an instant.\n-  To run a full batch of experiments, you can type ``default_args``\n   just ones, and then only repeat the fields that is different between\n   each run.\n\nMost importantly, ``Escher`` wants to establish a standard command line\ntool for machine learning work, and having a standard ``run.config.yml``\nis just the first step!\n\nWhy is ``Escher`` named \"Escher\"?\n---------------------------------\n\nIt used to be called ``Dave``, after my adviser. I thought it would be\nfunny to ``dave --config-file \"load_electrons.yml\"``. Now it is named to\n``Escher`` (as for the module), and ``escher-cli`` as the package name.\n\nThere already exists a package called ``escher`` which is why this\npackage is ``escher-cli``. However I like the ``-cli`` postfix b/c it is\nmore clear.\n\nHow shall I use ``Escher``?\n---------------------------\n\nFirst thing first, you could ``alias`` ``Escher`` with whoever you want\nto call to run your experiments \ud83d\ude00.\n\nAfter aliasing this after your favorite person, you can follow the\nexamples bellow :)\n\nNote that `**batteries are\nincluded** <https://www.facebook.com/episodeyang/videos/10101189402110434/>`__,\nand your mileage will vary.\n\nExample Usage\n-------------\n\nFirst install via ``pip`` (it's that simple!!)\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    pip install dave\n\nSuppose you have the following folder structure\n\n::\n\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 your_thesis\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 MAML_tensorflow\n     \u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n     \u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 experiment.yml\n     \u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 maml.py\n     \u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 models\n     \u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n     \u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 mlp.py\n\nwhere the experiment.yml file looks like this:\n\n.. code-block:: yaml\n\n    %YAML 1.2\n    ---\n    config:\n      max_concurrent: 10\n    env:\n      PYTHONPATH: test_directory\n    run: |\n      {env} python maml_bradly.py {args}\n    default_args:\n      npts: 100\n      num_epochs: 70000\n      num_tasks: 10\n      num_grad_steps: 1\n      num_points_sampled: 10\n      fix_amp: False\n    batch_args: # use good typing convention here\n      - num_tasks: 10\n        num_grad_steps: 1\n        num_points_sampled: 10\n      - num_tasks: 10\n        num_grad_steps: 4\n        num_points_sampled: 20\n    tmp:\n      - last_run: 10\n\nNow under the project root, you can just run\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    dave --config-file \"escher.py\"\n\nand it will automatically run the experiment twice, using the arguments\nin the ``batch_args`` field of the Yaml configuration file. ## To\nDevelop\n\nfirst download from github. Then under project folder, run (you also\nneed to install the packages).\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    make dev test\n\nBucket List\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  [ ] Allow extensions\n-  [ ] work on windows\n-  [ ] allow env files\n-  [ ] daemon mode\n\nHappy Doing Science!\n--------------------\n\n.. figure:: https://github.com/episodeyang/escher-cli/blob/master/figures/phd092316s.gif?raw=true\n   :alt: one-more-experiment\n\n   one-more-experiment\n\n\n",
