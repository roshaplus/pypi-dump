I honestly have no idea how\nthis is going to behave on other operating systems.\n\nUSAGE\n=====\n\nEnsure that the directory where you installed JekPost is in your :code:`$PATH`.\n\nTo create a new Jekyll post::\n\n  $ jekpost_create.py 'Post Title' dir --disqus 'your-disqus-shortname'\n\n:code:`dir` is the directory name where you wish to save the new post to. It\ncan also be relative pathnames.\n\nJekPost currently supports adding in an optional Disqus shortname.",
