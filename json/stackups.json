    "description": "Stackups program\n================\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n   \nIntroduction\n------------\n\nThis program's purpose is to allow engineers and designers to verify clearances\nbetween moving or stationary parts within a machine.  This check becomes more\ncritical when one recognizes that all the features of machined parts are\nmachined according to an allowable tolerance range.  These accumulated\ntolerances can close operating gaps and thus result in malfunctioning\nmachinery.\n\nIt should be obvious that all the features of all the parts will not be at the\nmaximum of their tolerance range, nor at their minimum.  This program, in\naddition to calculating gaps based on max/min tolerances, will also calculate\nclearances based on the probability of features being at some median size.\nThis probability calculation is used by a majority of the major manufacturers\ntoday (six sigma).\n\nWhat other sources are there for a program of this sort?  That's a good\nquestion.  I have not been able to find any that are publically available.\nMost large companies write their own program and it is for internal use only.\n\n\nCost\n----\n\nThis program is free for home use.  That is, you can learn how to use this\nprogram at home.  But if you use it in a professional environment, i.e.,\nto design a machine, this program cost $25 per seat.  You may pay for this\nprogram per the link set up on the website `<http://newconceptzdesign.com/>`_.\nThis program is \"donationware\", meaning I depend on you good grace to pay\nfor this product.  (See the license agreement for more information.)  This\nproduct has not been altered or impeded in any way pending your payment.\n\nAfter initial payment, updates are free.  I appreciate your support!\n\n\nHow it works\n------------\n\nThis program works within a Python [2] command prompt window (or more preferably,\nin an ipython command prompt window).  This program works very similarly to\nPython's standard \"list\" command, which is a basic, fundamental feature of\nPython, and therefore this program will be easy to learn.  YOU DO NOT HAVE\nTO KNOW THE PYTHON LANGUAGE TO USE THIS PROGRAM!\n\nThe fundamental element of the stackups program is called a stackunit, which\nis comprised of a dimension related to a machine part, a tolerance for that\ndimension, and a few other items related to that dimension.  A group of\nstackunits are used to define a stack.  The majority of times many stacks are\nevaluated within a given machine.  It is beneficial that these stacks are\nmanaged as a group.  This program does that.\n\nDuring the course of building up stacks, it is very often necessary to adjust\ndimensions to obtain proper clearances.  In such a case the same dimension may\nhave been used in multiple stacks.  This program will automatically make the\nnecessary changes to all stacks.\n\n\nTutorial\n--------\n\nIf you have never done a stackup, no problem.  A tutorial has been created to\nshow you how to do this, along with showing you how to use this program.  It\ncan be found at `<http://newconceptzdesign.com/>`_.\n\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\n* version 1.0: intial release\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n.. rubric:: Footnotes\n\n.. [1] Recommended Python engine on which to run this program (it's free):\n    `Anaconda <http://www.continuum.io/downloads/>`_\n\n.. [2] What is Python?  2 min 50 secs to 4 min 10 secs of this video from\n    Google describes Python: `<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKTZoB2Vjuk>`_\n    (An old version of Python, version 2.4, was used in this class.  As \n    concerns beginners, only two main differences exists between version 2.4\n    and the newer 3.x version: 1. for division in 2.4, make sure that you use a\n    decimal point in at least one of the numbers.  For example, in 2.4, \n    3/2 = 1, and 3/2.0 = 1.5.  That is, in 2.4, 3/2 is an integer division.  \n    2. In version 3.x, a parenthesis is needed for the print command.  That is,\n    `print('something to print')` instead of `print 'something to print'`.)",
