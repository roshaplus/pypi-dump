    "description": "Introduction\n============\n\nspotless is a set of flake8 plugins that test and enforce the good Python\nguidelines.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nspotless is available from pypi, so just run:\n\n  ``pip install spotless``\n\nThis will install ``flake8``, the ``hacking`` extension and ``spotless``.\n\nOrigin\n======\n\nI am too pedantic sometimes about good code, and those extensions were not\npossible to put into ``hacking`` itself, the OpenStack hacking guideline tool.\n\nVersioning\n==========\n\nspotless uses the major.minor.maintenance release notation, where maintenance\nreleases cannot contain new checks.  This way projects can gate on hacking\nby pinning on the major.minor number while accepting maintenance updates\nwithout being concerned that a new version will break the gate with a new\ncheck.",
