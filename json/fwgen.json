    "description": "Introduction\n============\n\nfwgen is a small management framework to simplify the management of\nip(6)tables based firewalls, that also integrates ipset support and\nzones in a non-restrictive way. It is *not* an abstraction layer of the\niptables syntax, so you still need to understand how to write iptables\nrules and how packets are processed through the iptables chains. This is\nthe intended project scope to ensure all existing functionality is made\navailable. fwgen does however help you create an efficient ruleset with\nvery little effort.\n\nfwgen is mainly targeted towards network gateways and hosts which are\nconfigured via configuration management systems, often with multiple\ninterfaces and complex rulesets that very fast gets unmanagable or\ninefficient if not done right. It may not be worth the effort to install\nit if you just have a simple server where you want to allow a couple of\nincoming ports.\n\nAdvantages of using fwgen:\n\n- Integrates iptables, ip6tables and ipsets in a common management framework\n- Uses a simple config file in YAML format for easy and readable configuration\n- Separation of duties between the loading of firewall rules at boot/ifup (restore-fw) and the rule generation (fwgen). No complex code are executed during boot/ifup.\n- Firewall operations are atomic. It either applies correctly or not, without flushing your existing ruleset, potentially leaving you temporarily exposed. However, ipsets are currently flushed for a very short period to enforce concistency with your configuration.\n- Automatic rollback to previous ruleset if not confirmed when applying rulesets in case something goes wrong. This can be disabled if run automatically by configuration management systems etc.\n- Namespace support. If executed in a namespace it automatically stores the rulesets in ``/etc/netns/<namespace>/`` instead of in the global namespace.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n-  At least Python 3.5\n-  PyYAML\n-  ipset\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n::\n\n    apt install ipset python3-yaml python3-pip\n    pip3 install fwgen\n\nInstalling from source\n======================\n\n::\n\n    apt install python3-venv\n    git clone https://github.com/hkbakke/fwgen\n    cd fwgen\n    python3 -m venv venv\n    . ./venv/bin/activate\n    pip install wheel\n    python setup.py clean --all bdist_wheel\n    deactivate  # Unless you only want to install it in your venv\n\n    apt install ipset python3-yaml python3-pip\n    cd dist\n    pip3 install <build>.whl\n\nPrepare configuration file\n==========================\n\nBy default fwgen will give an error if the config file is missing. This is by design to prevent accidental application of the very restrictive default firewall settings, which basically only allows host internal traffic.\n\nTo finish up you should do the following:\n\n::\n\n    mkdir /etc/fwgen\n    cp /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/fwgen/etc/config.yml.example \\\n        /etc/fwgen/config.yml\n    chown -R root. /etc/fwgen\n    chmod 600 /etc/fwgen/*.yml\n\n    # On Debian-based distros you should use restore-fw to ensure the\n    # firewall is activated on reboots and ifup\n    ln -s /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/fwgen/sbin/restore-fw \\\n        /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/restore-fw\n\nUpdate ``/etc/fwgen/config.yml`` with your ruleset. Look at the examples in the conifg file for guidance.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo generate the new ruleset:\n\n::\n\n    fwgen\n\nTo skip confirmation:\n\n::\n\n    fwgen --no-confirm\n\nIf ipsets in use causes issues with applying the new ruleset:\n\n::\n\n    fwgen --with-reset\n\n.. _example configuration: fwgen/etc/config.yml.example\n\n\n",
