    "description": "MMLlib - Modern library for handling Music Macro Language\n=========================================================\n\nAbout\n-----\n\nMMLlib is a pure Python implementation of functionality related to the\n`Music Macro\nLanguage <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Macro_Language>`__ as\nimplemented by Microsoft\u00ae GW-BASIC\u00ae and compatibles, which is its most\ncommon form, also implemented by the PC speaker driver in Linux and\n`BSD <http://www.mirbsd.org/man4/spkr>`__, with a number of extensions\nand changes:\n\n-  ``|`` denotes a bar line, ignored by the Linux/BSD driver\n-  support for multiple (parallel) instrument tracks\n-  a per-file header with work metadata (optional)\n-  lines starting with a ``#`` are comments\n-  the alias ``~`` is not supported\n\nThe library currently contains functions to:\n\n-  parse an (extended) MML file into metadata and individual tracks\n-  a duration estimate and the number of tracks is added to the metadata\n-  return a list of tuples (frequency, duration) to play (in a threaded\n   interpreter, such as Floppi-Music)\n-  bar lines are indicated separately as integer ``1``\n-  return an event-oriented list of measures / bars across all tracks;\n   each measure has a duration and a list of time-fixed tone on/off\n   events; facilitates playing in non-threaded interpreters and,\n   possibly, MIDI export\n-  export (extended) MML to MusicXML\n-  which can be imported by e.g. `MuseScore <https://musescore.org/>`__\n   to\u2026\n\n   -  double-check the MML score for mistakes in a visual representation\n   -  play, arrange, etc. the music\n   -  beautify the score to print it as sheet music\n   -  export into other formats or share on their website\n\n-  check tracks for synchronisation error\n-  missing tracks, i.e. with 0 bars\n-  missing bars (can only be detected at the end, of course)\n-  missing notes within a bar, relative to other tracks\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nSome example extended MML files are contained within the examples/\ndirectory, in lieu of better documentation for the extended format, in\naddition to the `MML format documentation\n<http://www.mirbsd.org/man4/spkr>`__.\n\nProjects using MMLlib\n---------------------\n\n::Floppi-Music::\n    `Floppi-Music <https://github.com/Natureshadow/Floppi-Music>`__ has\n    MML as input format for floppy drive music on Raspberry Pi and uses\n    MMLlib for processing. Floppi-Music is also the origin of MMLlib.\n\nDescription of the (extended) music macro language\n==================================================\n\nBased on http://www.antonis.de/qbebooks/gwbasman/play.html and\nhttps://www.mirbsd.org/man4/spkr .\n\nSymbols of MML\n--------------\n\n:A-G[#,+,-][length]:\n    A-G are notes. # or + following a note produces a sharp; - produces a\n    flat.\n\n:L(n):\n\n    Sets the length of each note. L4 is a quarter note, L1 is a whole note,\n    and so on. n may be from 1 to 64. Length may also follow the note to\n    change the length for that note only. A16 is equivalent to L16A. Default\n    is L4.\n\n:ML:\n    Music legato. Each note plays the full period set by L.\n\n:MN:\n    Music normal. Each note plays seven-eighths of the time determined by L\n    (length).\n\n:MS:\n    Music staccato. Each note plays three-quarters of the time determined by\n    L.\n\n:N(n):\n    Play note n. n may range from 0 to 84. In the 7 possible octaves, there\n    are 84 notes. n set to 0 (or omitted) indicates a rest.\n\n:O(n):\n    Octave 0 sets the current octave. There are 7 octaves (0 through 6).\n    Default is 4. Middle C is at the beginning of octave 2.\n\n:P(n):\n    Pause. n may range from 1-64; the current L value is used if omitted.\n\n:T(n):\n    Tempo. T sets the number of L4s in a minute. n may range from 32-255.\n    Default is 120.\n\n:. (period):\n    A period after a note increases the playing time of the note by 3/2\n    times the period determined by L (length of note) times T (tempo).\n    Multiple periods can appear after a note, and the playing time is scaled\n    accordingly. For example, A. will cause the note A to play one and half\n    times the playing time determined by L (length of the note) times T (the\n    tempo); two periods placed after A (A..) will cause the note to be\n    played at 9/4 times its ascribed value; an A with three periods (A...)\n    at 27/8, etc. Periods may also appear after a P (pause), and increase\n    the pause length as described above.\n\n:>:\n    A greater-than symbol raises the current octave by one.\n\n:<:\n    A less-than symbol lowers the current octave by one.\n\n:\\|:\n    Optionally used as a synchronisation mark for multi-track music. This is\n    a proprietary extension in the Floppi-Music project.\n\nComments\n--------\n\nLines starting with # are comments. At the beginning of the file,\ncomments may be used to encode metadata. This is yet to be specified.\nThe current implementation parses key/value pairs separated by a colon\nand a space, strips both key and value, lower-cases the key and adds it\nto a dictionary.\n\nThe MusicXML export currently specifically recognises these keys:\n\n-  Title, Copyright, Encoder (person), Source\n-  Composer, Lyrics, Arranger, Translator *xor* Artist (deprecated, only\n   one)\n\nAny other key is treated as miscellaneous field.\n\nVoices\n------\n\nThe voices of a song are interleaved. They are grouped per notation\nsystem, and the notation systems are seperated by empty lines.\n\nChangelog for MMLlib\n====================\n\n0.3\n---\n\n-  Enable Python 3 compatibility.\n-  Add new mmllint script.\n-  Include example MML songs.\n-  Add first parts of test suite.\n-  Some bugfixes.\n\n0.2\n---\n\n-  Add mml2musicxml script.\n\n0.1\n---\n\n-  Separate from Floppi-Music.\n\n",
