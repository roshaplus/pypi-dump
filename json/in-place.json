If you want a sign of those pesky\nvowels to remain, you can instead save the file's original contents in, say,\n``somefile.txt~`` by constructing the filehandle with::\n\n    in_place.InPlace('somefile.txt', backup_ext='~')\n\nor save to ``someotherfile.txt`` with::\n\n    in_place.InPlace('somefile.txt', backup='someotherfile.txt')\n\nCompared to the in-place filtering implemented by the Python standard library's\n|fileinput|_ module, ``in_place`` offers the following benefits:\n\n- Instead of hijacking ``sys.stdout``, a new filehandle is returned for\n  writing.\n- The filehandle supports all of the standard I/O methods, not just\n  ``readline()``.\n- There are options for setting the encoding, encoding error handling, and\n  newline policy for opening the file, along with support for opening files in\n  binary mode, and these options apply to both input and output.\n- The complete filename of the backup file can be specified; you aren't\n  constrained to just adding an extension.\n- When used as a context manager, ``in_place`` will restore the original file\n  if an exception occurs.\n- The creation of temporary files won't silently clobber innocent bystander\n  files.\n\n.. |fileinput| replace:: ``fileinput``\n.. _fileinput: https://docs.python.org/3/library/fileinput.html\n\n\nInstallation\n============\nJust use `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_ (You have pip, right?) to install\n``in_place`` and its dependencies::\n\n    pip install in_place\n\n\nBasic Usage\n===========\n``in_place`` provides three classes:\n\n- ``InPlaceText``, for working with text files (reading & writing ``unicode``\n  objects in Python 2, ``str`` objects in Python 3)\n\n- ``InPlaceBytes``, for working with binary files (reading & writing ``str``\n  objects in Python 2, ``bytes`` objects in Python 3)\n\n- ``InPlace``, for just calling ``open()`` and reading & writing whatever the\n  current Python's ``str`` type is\n\nAll of the classes' constructors take the following arguments:\n\n``name=<PATH>`` (required)\n   The path to the file to open & edit in-place\n\n``backup=<PATH>``\n   If set, the original contents of the file will be saved to the given path\n   when the instance is closed.\n\n``backup_ext=<EXTENSION>``\n   If set, the path to the backup file will be created by appending\n   ``backup_ext`` to the original file path.\n\n   ``backup`` and ``backup_ext`` are mutually exclusive.  ``backup_ext`` cannot\n   be set to the empty string.\n\n``delay_open=<BOOL>``\n   By default, the instance is opened (including creating temporary files and\n   so forth) as soon as it's created.  Setting ``delay_open=True`` disables\n   this; the instance must then be opened either via the ``open()`` method or\n   by using it as a context manager.\n\n``move_first=<BOOL>``\n   If ``True``, move the input file to a temporary location first and create\n   the output file in its place (\u00e0 la ``fileinput``) rather than the default\n   behavior of creating the output file at a temporary location and only moving\n   things around once ``close()`` is called (\u00e0 la GNU ``sed(1)``).\n\nThe ``InPlaceText`` constructor additionally accepts the optional arguments\n``encoding``, ``errors``, and ``newline``, which are passed straight through to\n``io.open`` for both reading and writing.\n\nOnce open, ``in_place`` instances act as filehandles with the usual filehandle\nattributes, specifically::\n\n    __iter__()              close()                 closed\n    flush()                 name                    read()\n    readall() *             readinto() *            readline()\n    readlines()             write()                 writelines()\n\n    * InPlaceBytes only\n\nThe classes also feature the following new or modified attributes:\n\n``open()``\n   Open the instance, creating filehandles for reading & writing.  This method\n   must be called first before any of the other I/O methods can be used.  It is\n   normally called automatically upon instance initialization unless\n   ``delay_open`` was set to ``True``.  A ``ValueError`` is raised if this\n   method is called more than once in an instance's lifetime.\n\n``close()``\n   Close filehandles and move files to their final destinations.  If called\n   after the filhandle has already been closed, ``close()`` does nothing.\n\n   Be sure to always close your instances when you're done with them by calling\n   ``close()`` or ``rollback()`` either explicity or implicitly (i.e., via use\n   as a context manager).\n\n``rollback()``\n   Like ``close()``, but discard the output data (keeping the original file\n   intact) instead of replacing the original file with it\n\n``__enter__()``, ``__exit__()``\n   When an ``in_place`` instance is used as a context manager, it will be\n   opened (if not open already) on entering and either closed (if all went\n   well) or rolled back (if an exception occurred) on exiting.  ``in_place``\n   context managers are not `reusable`_ but are `reentrant`_ (as long as no\n   further operations are performed after the innermost context ends).\n\n``input``\n   The actual filehandle that data is read from, in case you need to access it\n   directly\n\n``output``\n   The actual filehandle that data is written to, in case you need to access it\n   directly\n\n.. _reentrant: https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#reentrant-cms\n.. _reusable: https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#reusable-context-managers",
