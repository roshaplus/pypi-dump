    "description": "====\ngrin\n====\n\nI wrote grin to help me search directories full of source code. The venerable\nGNU grep_ and find_ are great tools, but they fall just a little short for my\nnormal use cases.\n\nThe main problem I had with GNU grep_ is that I had no way to exclude certain\ndirectories that I knew had nothing of interest for me, like .svn/, CVS/ and\nbuild/. The results from those directories obscured the results I was actually\ninterested in. There are tools like ack_, which skip these directories, but ack_\nalso only grepped files with extensions that it knew about. Furthermore, it had\nnot implemented the context lines feature, which I had grown accustomed to.\nRecent development has added these features, but I had already released grin by\nthe time I found out.\n\nOne can construct a GNU find_ command that will exclude .svn/ and the rest, but\nthe only reliable way I am aware of runs grep_ on each file independently. The\nstartup cost of invoking many separate grep_ processes is relatively large.\n\nAlso, I was bored. It seems to be catching. Perl has ack_, Ruby has rak_, and\nnow Python has grin.\n\nI wrote grin to get exactly the features I wanted:\n\n  * Recurse directories by default.\n  * Do not go into directories with specified names.\n  * Do not search files with specified extensions.\n  * Be able to show context lines before and after matched lines.\n  * Python regex syntax (one can quibble as to whether this is a feature or my\n    laziness for using the regex library provided with my implementation\n    language, but as a Python programmer, this is the syntax I am most familiar\n    with).\n  * Unless suppressed via a command line option, display the filename regardless\n    of the number of files.\n  * Accept a file (or stdin) with a list of newline-separated filenames. This\n    allows one to use find_ to feed grin a list of filenames which might have\n    embedded spaces quite easily.\n  * Grep through gzipped text files.\n  * Be useful as a library to build custom tools quickly.\n\nI have also exposed the directory recursion logic as the command-line tool\n\"grind\" in homage to find_. It will recurse through directories matching a glob\npattern to file names and printing out the matches. It shares the directory and\nfile extension skipping settings that grin uses.\n\nFor configuration, you can specify the environment variables GRIN_ARGS and\nGRIND_ARGS. These should just contain command-line options of their respective\nprograms. These will be prepended to the command-line arguments actually given.\nOptions given later will override options given earlier, so all options\nexplicitly in the command-line will override those in the environment variable.\nFor example, if I want to default to two lines of context and no skipped\ndirectories, I would have this line in my bashrc::\n\n    export GRIN_ARGS=\"-C 2 --no-skip-dirs\"\n\n.. _grep : http://www.gnu.org/software/grep/\n.. _ack : http://search.cpan.org/~petdance/ack/ack\n.. _rak: http://rak.rubyforge.org/\n.. _find : http://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall using pip_::\n\n  $ pip install grin\n\nRunning the unittests requires the nose_ framework::\n\n  $ pip install nose\n  ...\n  $ nosetests \n  .........................\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Ran 25 tests in 0.192s\n\n  OK\n  $ python setup.py test   # The other way to run the tests.\n  running test\n  ... etc.\n\nThe development sources are hosted on Github:\n\n  https://github.com/rkern/grin\n\nThere is one little tweak to the installation that you may want to consider. By\ndefault, setuptools installs scripts indirectly; the scripts installed to\n$prefix/bin or Python2x\\Scripts use setuptools' pkg_resources module to load\nthe exact version of grin egg that installed the script, then runs the script's\nmain() function. This is not usually a bad feature, but it can add substantial\nstartup overhead for a small command-line utility like grin. If you want the\nresponse of grin to be snappier, I recommend installing custom scripts that just\nimport the grin module and run the appropriate main() function. See the files\nexamples/grin and examples/grind for examples.\n\n.. _pip : https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/\n.. _nose : https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n\n\nUsing grin\n----------\n\nTo recursively search the current directory for a regex::\n\n  $ grin some_regex\n\nTo search an explicit set of files::\n\n  $ grin some_regex file1.txt path/to/file2.txt\n\nTo recursively search an explicit set of directories::\n\n  $ grin some_regex dir1/ dir2/\n\nTo search data piped to stdin::\n\n  $ cat somefile | grin some_regex -\n\nTo make the regex case-insensitive::\n\n  $ grin -i some_regex\n\nTo output 2 lines of context before, after, or both before and after the\nmatches::\n\n  $ grin -B 2 some_regex\n  $ grin -A 2 some_regex\n  $ grin -C 2 some_regex\n\nTo only search Python .py files::\n\n  $ grin -I \"*.py\" some_regex\n\nTo suppress the line numbers which are printed by default::\n\n  $ grin -N some_regex\n\nTo just show the names of the files that contain matches rather than the matches\nthemselves::\n\n  $ grin -l some_regex\n\nTo suppress the use of color highlighting::\n\n  # Note that grin does its best to only use color when it detects that it is\n  # outputting to a real terminal. If the output is being piped to a file or\n  # a pager, then no color will be used.\n  $ grin --no-color some_regex\n\nTo force the use of color highlighting when piping the output to something that\nis capable of understanding ANSI color escapes::\n\n  $ grin --force-color some_regex | less -R\n\nTo avoid recursing into directories named either CVS or RCS::\n\n  $ grin -d CVS,RCS some_regex\n\nBy default grin skips a large number of files. To suppress all of this behavior\nand search everything::\n\n  $ grin -sbSDE some_regex\n\nTo search for files newer than some_file.txt::\n\n  # If no subdirectory or file in the list contains whitespace:\n  $ grin some_regex `find . -newer some_file.txt`\n\n  # If a subdirectory or file in the list may contain whitespace:\n  $ find . -newer some_file.txt | grin -f - some_regex\n\n\nUsing grind\n-----------\n\nTo find files matching the glob \"foo*.py\" in this directory or any subdirectory\nusing same the default rules as grin::\n\n  $ grind \"foo*.py\"\n\nTo suppress all of the default rules and not skip any files or directories while\nsearching::\n\n  $ grind -sbSDE \"foo*.py\"\n\nTo find all files that are not skipped by the default rules::\n\n  $ grind\n\nTo start the search in a particular set of directories instead of the current\none (not the -- separator)::\n\n  $ grind --dirs thisdir that/dir -- \"foo*.py\"\n\n\nUsing grin as a Library\n-----------------------\n\nOne of the goals I had when writing grin was to be able to use it as a library\nto write custom tools. You can see one example that I quickly hacked up in \nexamples/grinimports.py . It reuses almost all of grin's infrastructure, except\nthat it preprocesses Python files to extract and normalize just the import\nstatements. This lets you conveniently and robustly search for import\nstatements. Look at \"grinimports.py --help\" for more information.\n\nexamples/grinpython.py allows you to search through Python files and specify whether you want to search through actual Python code, comments or string literals in any combination. For example::\n\n    $ grinpython.py -i --strings grep grin.py\n    grin.py:\n      188 :     \"\"\" Grep a single file for a regex by iterating over the lines in a file.\n      292 :         \"\"\" Do a full grep.\n    ...\n\n    $ grinpython.py -i --comments grep grin.py\n    grin.py:\n      979 :     # something we want to grep.\n\n    $ grinpython.py -i --python-code grep grin.py\n    grin.py:\n      187 : class GrepText:\n      291 :     def do_grep(self, fp):\n    ...\n\nSimilarly, it should be straightforward to write small tools like this which\nextract and search text metadata from binary files.\n\n\nTo Do\n-----\n\n* Figure out the story for grepping UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 Unicode text files.\n\n\nBugs and Such\n-------------\n\nPlease make a new issue at the Bitbucket issue tracker\n\n  https://bitbucket.org/rsalmaso/grin3\n\nor on the Github mirror\n\n  https://github.com/rsalmaso/grin3",
