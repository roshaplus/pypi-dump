    "description": "CAGE is a fairy generic and complete cellular automaton simulation\r\n    engine in Python.  It supports both 1D and 2D automata, a variety\r\n    of prepackaged rules, and the concept of \"agents\" which can move\r\n    about independently on the map for implementing agent behavior.\r\n\r\n    CAGE comes with numerous examples of fully-functional CA systems,\r\n    including Conway's Game of Life, Langton's self-reproducing\r\n    automaton, Langton's \"vants,\" and 1D automata rule explorers.  It\r\n    also comes with simple displayers (including a curses interface\r\n    for 2D automata).  Also included is a unique implementation of a\r\n    finite state machine (ant.py).",
