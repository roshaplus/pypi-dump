    "description": "insteonplm\n==========\n\n|Build Status| |GitHub release| |PyPI|\n\nThis is a Python package to interface with an Insteon Powerline Modem\n(formerly called \"PowerLinc\"). It should work with either the USB or\nRS-252 serial based devices such as the\n`2413U <https://www.insteon.com/powerlinc-modem-usb>`__ and\n`2412S <https://www.insteon.com/powerlinc-modem-serial>`__. Other models\nhave not been tested but the underlying protocol is dusty and ancient\nand I wouldn't be surprised to learned that this package works fine on\nsome Bakelite X10 oddity from the 1980s. If you find success with\nsomething, please let me know.\n\nPowerLinc Modems are not telephony devices, they provide a Serial or USB\ninterface to an on-premisis Insteon IoT device network. This is either a\npowerline signalling protocol, an RF wireless protocol, ar a dual-band\nhybrid network.\n\nIf you're looking for a library to work wtih the emulated PLM offered by\nan INSTEON `Hub <https://www.insteon.com/which-hub-are-you>`__ like the\n2245 you might be able to use the\n`insteonlocal <https://github.com/phareous/insteonlocal>`__ package.\n\nThis package was created primarily to support an insteonplm platform for\nthe `Home Assistant <https://home-assistant.io/>`__ automation platform\nbut it is structured to be general-purpose and should be usable for\nother applications as well.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n-  Python 3.4 or 3.5 with asyncio\n-  Some form of Insteon PLM\n-  At least one Insteon device\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n\n-  This does not actually exist yet.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can, of course, just install the most recent release of this package\nusing ``pip``. This will download the more rececnt version from\n`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/insteonplm>`__ and install it to\nyour host.\n\n::\n\n    pip install insteonplm\n\nIf you want to grab the the development code, you can also clone this\ngit repository and install from local sources:\n\n::\n\n    cd python-insteonplm\n    pip install .\n\nAnd, as you probably expect, you can live the developer's life by\nworking with the live repo and edit to your heart's content:\n\n::\n\n    cd python-insteonplm\n    pip install -e .\n\nDevice Permissions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAny user account that you want to be able to access the PLM will need\npermissions to access the USB or Serial device in ``/dev``. In Linux,\nyou'll probably want to do something like this:\n\n::\n\n    sudo usermod -a -G dialout <username>\n\nIn FreeBSD, it'll be something like:\n\n::\n\n    sudo pw usermod <username> -G dialer\n\nYou may find that you have to log out and log back in as that user for\nthe change to take effect on existing sessions.\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nThe package installs a command-line tool which will connect to your\nreceiver, power it up, and then monitor all activity and changes that\ntake place. The code for this console monitor is in\n``insteonplm/tools.py`` and you can invoke it by simply running this at\nthe command line with the appropriate IP and port number that matches\nyour receiver and its configured port:\n\n::\n\n    insteonplm_monitor --device /dev/ttyUSB0\n\nInteresting Links\n-----------------\n\n-  `Project Home <https://github.com/nugget/python-insteonplm>`__\n\nCredits\n-------\n\n-  This package was written by David McNett.\n-  https://github.com/nugget\n-  https://keybase.io/nugget\n\nHow can you help?\n-----------------\n\n-  First and foremost, you can help by forking this project and coding.\n   Features, bug fixes, documentation, and sample code will all add\n   tremendously to the quality of this project.\n\n-  If you have a feature you'd love to see added to the project but you\n   don't think that you're able to do the work, I'm someone is probably\n   happy to perform the directed development in the form of a bug or\n   feature bounty.\n\n-  If you're anxious for a feature but it's not actually worth money to\n   you, please open an issue here on Github describing the problem or\n   limitation. If you never ask, it'll never happen\n\n-  If you just want to thank me for the work I've already done, I'm\n   happy to accept your thanks, gratitude, pizza, or bitcoin. My bitcoin\n   wallet address can be on `Keybase <https://keybase.io/nugget>`__ or\n   you can send me a donation via\n   `PayPal <https://www.paypal.me/macnugget>`__.\n\n-  Or, if you're not comfortable sending me money directly, I'll be\n   nearly as thrilled (really) if you donate to `the\n   ACLU <https://action.aclu.org/donate-aclu>`__,\n   `EFF <https://supporters.eff.org/donate/>`__, or\n   `EPIC <https://epic.org>`__ and let me know that you did.\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/nugget/python-insteonplm.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/nugget/python-insteonusb\n.. |GitHub release| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/release/nugget/python-insteonplm.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/nugget/python-insteonplm/releases\n.. |PyPI| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/insteonplm.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/insteonplm",
