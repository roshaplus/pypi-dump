Once created, you can deploy the single file executable binaries into your containers/vms simply by copying the file. No dependencies to track\n        \n        Configuration management tools, like: Salt, Puppet, Chef, and Ansible can pull down the executable binaries from any acceptable datastore (AWS S3 for example) and call them as part of your DevOps system. \n        \n        ## Basic Usage\n        \n        first, setup the virtualenv\n        ```\n        #!bash\n        $ bash initialize.sh\n        ```\n        \n        \n        \n        Learn more \n        \n        https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex\n        \n        https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller\n        \n        http://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/repository-structure-and-python\n        \nPlatform: UNKNOWN",
