    "description": "The environment provides a graphical user interface for simulating different model types (currently Functional Mockup Units and Modelica Models), plotting result variables and applying simulation result analysis tools like Fast Fourier Transform. Additionally advanced tools for linear system analysis are provided that can be applied to the automatically linearized models. The modular concept of the software enables easy development of further plugins for both simulation and analysis.",
