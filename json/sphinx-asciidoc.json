    "description": "AsciiDoc Builder and Writer for Sphinx (asciidoc)\n=================================================\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nSphinx is used to build documentation from reST source files using\nDocutils. While there are many Sphinx output writers, such as html,\nePub, and LaTex, there has been no conversion tool available to convert\nSphinx based reST documentation to asciidoc files. Some of the open source \nprojects, such as Pandoc, do not understand most of the Sphinx directives \nand are only able to proceed the simple reST format. \n\nThe following is my attempt to write an AsciiDoc extension\nfor Sphinx and Docutils that would be able to serve as a builder and\nwriter for Sphinx, as well as a simple reST to AsciiDoc convertor.\n\nIt uses Python 2.7 and 3.\n\nStandalone usage\n----------------\n\nYou can also use the ``./asciidoc/writer.py`` as a simple convertor of\nsingle reST files based on **docutils** reST format. \n\nTo convert a reST file to asciidoc:\n\n    python writer.py file.rst\n\nWhen the script finishes, it creates a new asciidoc file with the same\nname and the ``.adoc`` extension.\n\nCurrent status\n--------------\n\nThe extension is now a beta 0.9.1 version. It understands the majority\nof Docutils markup and produces a usable asciidoc format, that can be\nprocessed with Asciidoctor. However, there are improvements needed.\n\nNote, that the convertor includes files with ``include::`` directives,\nthat is it puts their content directly into the referencing file. The\nconvertor does not preserve individual files for included content.\n\nThe conversion may fail because of ``NotImplemented Error`` that is\ncaused when the convertor does not understand how to interpret a\nSphinx directive. Some of the nodes are only partially implemented. \nThey do not throw out an error, but they do not know how to convert the\ncontent either. Instead, they pass the content as plain text and wrap it\nwith the name of the directive, so that users know where the conversion \nfails. \n\nIf you experience such troubles, please report this in the *issues* of this \nGithub project (http://github.com/lruzicka/sphinx_asciidoc) and describe which\ndirective is not rendered and how do you think it should be rendered in asciidoc or\nhow should the html rendering from **Asciidoctor** look like.\n\nFuture improvements\n--------------------\n\nIn the future, I will try to focus on:\n\n1. implementation of formatting features of the nodes that only produce plain\n   text,\n2. implement the not yet implemented Sphinx and Docutils nodes, so that\n   the AsciiDoc files use all possible features of the original reST and\n   Sphinx format,\n3. improve the visitors (conversion functions) so that the AsciiDoc\n   output is always flawless and possibly error free.\n\nInstalling the **sphinx_asciidoc** package\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe package is in **PyPI**. To install it:\n\n    pip3 install sphinx_asciidoc\n\nNow, you should be able to use it.\n\nUsing the **asciidoc** builder\n------------------------------\n\nWhen building the documentation from the source files, choose the\n**asciidoc** builder with the ``-b`` option:\n\n    sphinx-build -b asciidoc ./source ./build\n\nThe built documentation is placed in the ``./build/asciidoc`` directory.\n\nDisclaimer\n----------\n\nYou can already use the software, but you shall take it as not fully\ndeveloped, so there still may be problems and some features may not work\nproperly or at all.\n\n\n",
