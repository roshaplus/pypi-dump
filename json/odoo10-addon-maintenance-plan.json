Their name\nhave to be unique and can be set as active or inactive, should these not be\nused anymore.\n\nOn any equipment over the maintenance tab, the maintenance plan will appear\nas an embedded list view, allowing to add different maintenance kind with their\nown period and duration. The next maintenance date will then be computed\nautomatically according to today's date and the period defined, but the\nmaintenance request won't be created automatically as is the case in Odoo's\nMaintenance module.\n\nInstead, this module uses the original Cron job of Odoo's Maintenance module\nto generate maintenance requests, should there not be any requests which is not\ndone, at the request date matching the maintenance plan next_maintenance_date\nfor this equipment and this maintenance kind !\n\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/{repo_id}/10.0\n\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/maintenance/issues>`_.
