    "description": "ZtoRGBpy\r\n========\r\nComplex number to perceptually uniform RGB subset mapping library.\r\n\r\nThis library operates on buffer object using numpy, and is designed to convert a 2d array of complex number in to an 2d array to 3-tuples of RGB values suitable for passing to matplotlibs imshow function\r\n\r\nVersion Numbering\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nZtoRGBpy user a version numbering system based on `PEP440 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/ \"PEP 440 -- Version Identification and Dependency Specification\">`_, with versions numbers `{major:d}.{minor:d}[.{patch:d}][.dev{year:0<4d}{month:0<2d}{day:0<2d}]` providing a minimum of major and minor version, with optional patch number for bug fixes, and development tag for pre-release builds.\r\n\r\nMajor Version\r\n+++++++++++++\r\nNew Major Version Release, may change the public API in non backwards compatible ways, that may break existing code.\r\n\r\nMinor Version\r\n+++++++++++++\r\nMinor Version, releases may add new features to the public API, but will remain fully backwards compatible with the document API for the Major Version Series.\r\n\r\nPatch Version \r\n+++++++++++++\r\nPatch are solely for fixing bugs in the code or API, these will only change the public API when it is found to perform in a manor contrary to the documented API\r\n\r\nDevelopment Version\r\n+++++++++++++++++++\r\nThis is a Development release, has not be tested, it may be unstable or have breaks in the API, such a release should NOT be relied upon.",
