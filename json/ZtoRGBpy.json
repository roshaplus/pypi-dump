    "description": "ZtoRGBpy\n========\nComplex number to perceptually uniform RGB subset mapping library.\n\nThis library operates on buffer object using numpy, and is designed to convert a 2d array of complex number in to an 2d array to 3-tuples of RGB values suitable for passing to matplotlibs imshow function\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n * __numpy__: 1.x >= 1.6 \n * __matplotlib__: 1.x >= 1.3 or 2.x\n\nVersion Numbering\n-----------------\n\nZtoRGBpy user a version numbering system based on `PEP440 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/ \"PEP 440 -- Version Identification and Dependency Specification\">`_, with versions numbers `{major:d}.{minor:d}[.{patch:d}][.dev{year:0<4d}{month:0<2d}{day:0<2d}]` providing a minimum of major and minor version, with optional patch number for bug fixes, and development tag for pre-release builds.\n\n### Major Version\nNew Major Version Release, may change the public API in non backwards compatible ways, that may break existing code.\n\n### Minor Version\nMinor Version, releases may add new features to the public API, but will remain fully backwards compatible with the document API for the Major Version Series.\n\n### Patch Version \nPatch are solely for fixing bugs in the code or API, these will only change the public API when it is found to perform in a manor contrary to the documented API\n\n### Development Version\nThis is a Development release, has not be tested, it may be unstable or have breaks in the API, such a release should NOT be relied upon.",
