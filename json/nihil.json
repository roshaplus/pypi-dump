It provides the following facilities:\n\n* ``Request`` and ``Response`` objects (\u00e0la WebOb, but simpler).\n* HTTP protocol implementation for ``asyncio``.\n* HTTP request parser.\n* Request routing.\n\nNIHIL lends itself to be used as a small web framework, by means of the\nrouting system; or to use the lower level components its parts for other\npurposes.\n\nOne of the mails goals is to keep the package compatible with both Python\n2.7 and 3.x, supporting both CPython and PyPy.",
