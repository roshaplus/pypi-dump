    "description": "This project is to provide functionality for network\r\nconnectivity health check. First we need to describe a network\r\nconnectivity graph (e.g. some nodes can send data to others via\r\ntagged VLAN). We then can use this graph to check if network\r\nequipment is configured accoring to the graph (i.e. we can\r\nsend probe data from one node and then to try to catch these\r\ndata on the other one).",
