    "description": "What is loom?\n=============\n\nLoom is a tool to create and execute bioinformatics workflows.\n\nWe observed that many bioinformaticians are doing analysis in a way that\nis not repeatable or traceable, and that cannot be easily migrated to a\nnew compute environment. For example:\n\n- Depending on local software installations and environment settings\n- Executing commands manually\n- Failing to record analysis details and results in a database\n- Depending on file names and paths that may change and cannot be verified\n\nLoom is designed as an easy-to-use analysis platform that remedies these\nproblems to make analysis repeatable, your results traceable, and your\nworkflows portable to other platforms.\n\nWhy use loom?\n=============\n\nMake your analysis pipelines portable\n-------------------------------------\n\n-  Loom uses Docker to make your pipelines platform-agnostic and to\n   avoid using local software installations or environment settings\n-  The same pipelines can be run in the cloud, on a local cluster, or on\n   your laptop\n-  Loom will seamlessly pull data from your local path, a remote file\n   server, or an object store\n\nShare your analysis and results\n-------------------------------\n\n-  Loom analyses and results are defined as JSON documents that can be\n   easily shared by email\n-  JSON documents defining analyses and results have the same meaning\n   anywhere, with no dependencies on your software configuration, local\n   environment settings, or file locations. External references to files\n   or applications (Docker images) can always be verified using a\n   cryptographic hash of contents\n\nKeep your data secure\n---------------------\n\n-  Loom lets you run all your analysis with encryption of data in\n   transit and at rest\n\nMake sure your analysis is repeatable\n-------------------------------------\n\n-  The same features that make loom sharable help to ensure\n   repeatability: input files are verified with a cryptographic hash,\n   and applications are stored in Docker containers that can be verified\n   by image ID\n-  Analyses and results are recorded in a persistent database\n\nNever lose track of how a result was generated\n----------------------------------------------\n\n-  When answering questions like \"Where did this file come from?\", \"What\n   software version did we use to produce this result\", or \"What\n   settings did we use for this?\", you should never be scrambling\n   through your notes or digging through output logs. Loom keeps track\n   of result provenance and can tell you all the steps that were\n   performed from import of the original input data to producing the\n   final result.\n\nWhat is the current status?\n===========================\n\nLoom is under active development.
