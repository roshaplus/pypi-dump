    "description": "# Simple declarative package management\n## For Arch Linux\n\nList the packages you want installed in `/etc/decpac.conf`.  Run `decpac` and packages will be installed/uninstalled until the set of installed packages matches the list.  This doesn't manage config files, cache files, other generated files, etc.  If you like this but want more rigorous declarative package management check out [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) and [NixOS](https://nixos.org/).\n\n##### Why declarative management?\n\n1. You want to install the same packages on a different system.  Just copy `decpac.conf` over and run `decpac`!\n2. You're looking for a program that does X, and there are 10 programs that say they do X.  If you install them all, you'll definitely forget to uninstall them.  Write a note in `decpac.conf`!\n3. You're trying to clean up your system but you don't remember why you installed a package, or even what it does.  Organize and annotate your `decpac.conf` with comments!\n4. Help me out here.\n5. Diff your config files!\n\n# Usage\n\nInstall with\n```\npip install decpac\n```\n\nIf you don't have a configuration file, create one with\n```\nsudo decpac generate\n```\n\nEdit your `/etc/decpac.conf` (be careful not to delete system files). Then run\n```\nsudo decpac\n```\nto synchronize your packages.",
