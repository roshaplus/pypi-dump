    "description": "A sample Python project\n=======================\n\nA sample project that exists as an aid to the `Python Packaging User Guide\n<https://packaging.python.org>`_'s `Tutorial on Packaging and Distributing\nProjects <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html>`_.\n\nThis projects does not aim to cover best practices for Python project\ndevelopment as a whole. For example, it does not provide guidance or tool\nrecommendations for version control, documentation, or testing.\n\n----\n\nThis is the README file for the project.\n\nThe file should use UTF-8 encoding and be written using `reStructuredText\n<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_. It\nwill be used to generate the project webpage on PyPI and will be displayed as\nthe project homepage on common code-hosting services, and should be written for\nthat purpose.\n\nTypical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic\nusage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not\na good idea, although a simple \"What's New\" section for the most recent version\nmay be appropriate.\n\n\n",
