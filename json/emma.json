    "description": "Emma is a Python package designed for solving optimization problems. It contains a group of utilities that will help you model the problem and efficient use your knowledge of it to solve it.\n\nOne of Emma\u2019s modules deals with constraint programming. Constraint Programming is a branch of operational research specialized in combinatorial problems. Its main porpoise is to solve constraint satisfaction problems, CSP\u2019s, that is, finding feasible solutions of problems without considering objectives functions. This module gives you tools to model operational research problems, an algorithm to solve CSP\u2019s, a set of search utilities to find good solutions, and when possible optimize your problem.",
