    "description": "python-fitparse\n===============\n\nWelcome to the rewrite for the next generation (ng) of python-fitparse.\n\nHere's a preview of what's to come. Any and all feedback is welcome.\n\n**WARNING:** This is a WIP considered *HIGHLY* unstable. You want to use the\nmaster branch for now.\n\nMajor Changes\n-------------\n\n  * New, hopefully cleaner public API with a clear division between accessible\n    and internal parts. (Still unstable and partially complete.)\n\n  * Proper documentation!\n    [Available here](http://dtcooper.github.com/python-fitparse/).\n\n  * Unit tests and example programs.\n\n  * **(WIP)** Command line tools (eg a `.FIT` to `.CSV` converter).\n\n  * Component fields and compressed timestamp headers now supported and not\n    just an afterthought. Closes issues #6 and #7.\n\n  * FIT file parsing is generic enough to support all types. Going to have\n    specific `FitFile` subclasses for more popular file types like activities.\n\n  * **(WIP)** Converting field types to normalized values (for example,\n    `bool`, `date_time`, etc) done in a consistent way, that's easy to\n    customize by subclassing the converter class. I'm going to use something\n    like the Django form-style `convert_<field name>` idiom on this class.\n\n  * The FIT profile is its own complete python module, rather than using\n    `profile.def`.\n\n    * Bonus! The profile generation script is _less_ ugly (but still an\n      atrocity) and supports every\n      [ANT FIT SDK](http://www.thisisant.com/resources/fit) from version 1.00\n      up to 5.10.\n\n  * A working `setup.py` module. Closes issue #2, finally! I'll upload the\n    package to [PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/) when it's done.\n\n  * Support for parsing one record at a time. This can be done using\n    `<FitFile>.parse_one()` for now, but I'm not sure of the exact\n    implementation yet.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis software is offered under a *slightly* modified ISC-style license.\n\n\n    Copyright (c) 2011-2013, David Cooper <dave@kupesoft.com>\n    All rights reserved.\n\n    Dedicated to Kate Lacey\n\n    Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software\n    for any purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided\n    that the above copyright notice, the above dedication, and this\n    permission notice appear in all copies.\n\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL\n    WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED\n    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.
