    "description": "GraphScraper\n=================\n\nGraphScraper is a Python 3 library that contains a base graph implementation designed\nto be turned into a web scraper for graph data. It has two major features:\n\n1) The graph automatically manages a database (using either SQLAlchemy or\nFlask-SQLAlchemy) where it stores all the nodes and edges the graph has seen.\n\n2) The base graph implementation provides hook methods that, if implemented,\nturn the graph into a web scraper.\n\nYet another graph implementation - why\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThere are many excellent graph libraries available for different purposes. I started\nimplementing this one because i haven't found a graph library that is dynamic (i don't\nneed the whole graph in memory - or on disk - before i start working with it), that\ncan be used as a web scraper (to seamlessly load nodes and edges from some remote\ndata source when that piece of data is needed) and that keeps all data (the graph)\nautomatically up-to-date on the disk. GraphScraper aims to satisfy these requirements.\n\nDemo - igraph\n------------------\n\nBesides the base graph implementation, a working demo using the igraph_ library\nis also included that shows how you can implement and use an actual graph-scraper.\nInstead of web-scraping, this demo uses an igraph graph instance as the \"remote\"\nsource to scrape data from.\n\nDependencies\n-----------------\n\nThe project requires SQLAlchemy_ or Flask-SQLAlchemy_ to be installed.\nIf you wish to the included igraph-based graph implementation, you will also need\nigraph_ library.\n\nContribution\n-----------------\n\nAny form of constructive contribution (feedback, features, bug fixes, tests, additional\ndocumentation, etc.) is welcome.\n\n.. _Flask-SQLAlchemy: http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/\n.. _igraph: http://igraph.org\n.. _SQLAlchemy: https://www.sqlalchemy.org/\n\n\n",
