    "description": "Bloomberg Python API version 3.5\n================================\n\nThis directory contains an interface for interacting with Bloomberg API\nservices using the Python programming language.\n\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nThis SDK requires the following products:\n\n- CPython version 2.6 or 2.7\n\n- Bloomberg C++ SDK version 3.5 or later\n\n- Visual C++ 2008 or 2010 (Windows) or GCC 4.1+ (Linux)\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nNote that installation requires a working C compiler and the C headers\ndistributed as part of the Bloomberg C++ SDK.\n\n1. Set the `BLPAPI_ROOT` environment variable to the location at which the\n   Bloomberg C++ SDK is installed. (On Windows, this location may be of the\n   form `C:\\blp\\API\\APIv3\\C++API\\v3.5.2.1\\`.)\n\n2. To compile and install the `blpapi` Python package for all users, run\n\n       > python setup.py install\n\n   To compile and install the `blpapi` Python package for only the current\n   user, run\n\n       > python setup.py install --user\n\n   (Note that the former command requires root/administrator access, while the\n   latter does not.)\n\n   Documentation on additional build and installation options is available by\n   running\n\n       > python setup.py --help\n\n3. (optional) Copy the C++ SDK shared library/DLL to a standard library\n   location (e.g. `/usr/lib` on Linux), or update the system-wide library path\n   (configured by `/etc/ld.so.conf` on Linux and by setting the `PATH`\n   environment variable on Windows) to include the directory containing the\n   C++ SDK library.  Note that this step is not necessary for users who already\n   have a system-wide installation of the C++ SDK, including Windows users who\n   have the Bloomberg Terminal software installed.\n\n\nWriting Bloomberg API Programs in Python\n----------------------------------------\n\nIn order for python scripts to call Bloomberg API functions, the libraries\ndistributed as part of the Bloomberg C++ SDK must be available to the Python\ninterpreter.  Step 3 of installation, above, provides system-wide installation\nof this library. Linux/Solaris/*nix users without system-wide installations\nmust set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Darwin/MacOS X)\nenvironment variable to include the directory containing the `blpapi3` shared\nlibraries.  Windows users may need to set the `PATH` variable to the\ndirectory containing `blpapi3_32.dll` or `blpapi3_64.dll`. (Note that Windows\nusers with the Bloomberg Terminal software installed already have versions of\nthese libraries in their `PATH`.)\n\nAfter installation, the `blpapi` module can be imported by a Python script or\nwithin the CPython interpreter:\n\n    >>> import blpapi\n    >>> options = blpapi.SessionOptions()\n    >>> options.setServerHost('localhost')\n    >>> options.setServerPort(8194)\n    >>> session = blpapi.Session(options)\n    >>> session.start()\n\nNote that many Python installations add the current directory to the module\nsearch path. If the Python interpreter is invoked from the installer directory,\nsuch a configuration will attempt to use the (incomplete) local `blpapi`\ndirectory as a module. If the above `import` line fails with the message\n`Import Error: No module named _internals`, move to a different directory\nbefore invoking `python`.\n\nDocumentation for individual Bloomberg API classes and functions is provided\nthrough Python's built-in help system.\n\nFurther documentation on programming the Bloomberg API is available in the\nDeveloper's Guide, available at <http://open.bloomberg.com>.\n\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nA collection of complete Python programs covering a wide range of typical API\nusage is available in the `examples` directory, located in the same directory\nas this `README` file. Note that many examples make use of command-line\narguments to specify server and authentication configuration; in most cases\nusage information can be obtained by passing the `--help` option on the command\nline.\n\n\nImplementation Notes\n--------------------\n\n- The Python Bloomberg SDK does not provide direct support for Python `unicode`\n  objects. Clients can pass unicode data to SDK functions accepting strings by\n  calling `u.encode('utf-8')` for an appropriate `unicode` object `u`; a string\n  `s` received from an SDK function can be converted to a `unicode` object by\n  calling `s.decode('utf-8')`.\n\n- Python Bloomberg SDK types do not provide support for the Python `copy` or\n  `pickle` modules.\n\n\nCopyright and License\n---------------------\n\nAll files Copyright 2012 Bloomberg Finance L.P.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis proprietary software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"),\nto use, publish, or distribute copies of the Software, and to permit persons to\nwhom the Software is furnished to do so.\n\nAny other use, including modifying, adapting, reverse engineering, decompiling,\nor disassembling, is not permitted.\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
