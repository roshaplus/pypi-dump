    "description": "# Imperialism Remake\n\n**[Home](http://remake.twelvepm.de/) - [Community](http://remake.twelvepm.de/forum/) - [Sources](https://github.com/Trilarion/Imperialism-Remake) - [Download](http://remake.twelvepm.de/home/download/) - [Tasks](http://remake.twelvepm.de/tasks/) - [Contact](http://remake.twelvepm.de/home/contact/)**\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/imperialism-remake/badge/?version=latest)](http://imperialism-remake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) Player Manual\n- [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/imperialism-remake-definition/badge/?version=latest)](http://imperialism-remake-definition.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) Game Design\n- [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/imperialism-remake-developer/badge/?version=latest)](http://imperialism-remake-developer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) Developer Manual\n\n## Test\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Trilarion/imperialism-remake.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Trilarion/imperialism-remake)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Access the source code\n\nThe [source code](https://github.com/Trilarion/Imperialism-Remake) is on GitHub. You can also download a zipped\n[one-time snapshot](https://github.com/Trilarion/imperialism-remake/archive/master.zip). Otherwise just register\nwith GitHub and [fork the project](https://github.com/Trilarion/imperialism-remake).\n\n### Using Git\n\n[Download Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) or on Windows install [TortoiseGit](https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/)\nwhich conveniently integrates git with the explorer.\n\nGit is not easy. Be careful and read some instructions first. I liked this [tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing).\n\n- Once you forked the project, clone it on your computer with \"git clone https://github.com/USER/Imperialism-Remake.git\"\n- Regularly get updates with fetch/pull\n- Programm as usual (commit)\n- When task is done, create pull request.\n\n### Python\n\nDownload and install latest [Python 3.X](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) is quite good.\n\n#### 32 or 64 bit on Windows\n\n Although it doesn't matter here, I use 64 bit and also deliver packages in 64 bit only.\n\n### Third Party Modules for Python\n\nOnly PyQt5 and PyYAML are required for running.\n\nSphinx, PyInstaller are additionally required for development.\n\n#### PyQt5\n\n[PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5) is a Python binding of the Qt framework and is required for running.\n\nPyQt5 has not much [documentation](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/) on its own but the [API classes overview](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/classes.html)\nof the underlying C++ Qt 5.X framework is very useful since PyQt5 is almost 100% recreating it.\n\n#### PyYAML\n\n[PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML) is required for running.\n\n### Start\n\n- Run file \"./source/start.py\" with working directory \"./\".\n- Start with command line parameter \"debug\" for (more) output on the console.\n- A folder with log files and settings is created under \"user folder/Imperialism Remake User Data\" where \"user folder\" is the typical user folder of your system (Windows C:/Users/XXX/).\n\n### IDE\n\nI use [PyCharm Community Edition](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/). Since the .idea folder is contained the project\ncan probably be opened directly with PyCharm. Another nice IDE is [Spyder](https://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/).\n\n### Tools\n\n- [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) is needed for the creation of the Windows installer.\n- Many graphics are edited with [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/en/).\n\n### Packaging\n\nUnder construction.",
