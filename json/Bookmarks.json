    "description": "Bookmarks is a simple personal web-based application to manage web bookmarks.\r\nIt was coded as a funny practice, but it includes some nice features: advanced search, tags cloud, years cloud.\r\nIt's written in Python 3 and uses BottlePy web microframework and jQuery javascript library. Both are included with the package.\r\nI think this little application can be useful for anyone learning\r\nPython web programming.",
