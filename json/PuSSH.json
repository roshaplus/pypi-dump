    "description": "PUSSH is \"Pythonic Ubiquitous SSH\" - basically a wrapper for the SSH client\r\nconsisting of two Python modules (at this time one is called explicitly by the\r\nother, although the present construct may change in future versions) - for usage\r\non networks, clusters, or machine farms with any number of hosts, large or\r\nsmall, or indeed over the entire internet, for that matter, with the proviso\r\nthat the SSH client is enabled via Kerberos or RSA/DSA keys in such a way as to\r\navoid any explicit password authentication. Using PUSSH, you can send the same\r\ncommand via SSH to a range, cluster or batch of machines of practically any\r\nsize, and more importantly, IN PARALLEL, IN REAL TIME - if the abovementioned\r\nconditions for SSH password authentication are met. If not, then some nifty\r\ncapabilities are also on offer for purely sequential command execution on your\r\ntarget machines.",
