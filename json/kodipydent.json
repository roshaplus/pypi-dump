    "description": "kodipydent\n==========\nA complete Python client for the Kodi JSON-RPC API\n\n\nWhy?\n----\nBecause JSON-RPC is one of the trickier communication schemes to write for. And if you want to code for it, then you're probably going to get into bit of a dysfunctional relationship with the documentation. \n\nWhat?\n-----\nA native-Python JSON-RPC client. Loads all the methods from your Kodi instance each time it gets instantiated, so you know you're never behind. And, it puts it in some semblance of a reasonable object structure.\n\nFuture updates will bundle a carefully-manicured static hive that will give you a better object structure at the cost of not always being completely up-to-date.\n\nHow?\n----\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> from kodipydent import Kodi\n    >>> my_kodi = Kodi('192.168.1.1')\n    >>> movies = my_kodi.VideoLibrary.GetMovies()\n\nSimple as that. beekeeper makes it easy to use and easy to learn; if you don't know the name of the method you want to use, just do this:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> print(my_kodi)\n\nand you'll get a printout of all the methods available, and all the variables each one takes.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install kodipydent\n\nUnder the Hood\n--------------\n\nkodipydent is driven by beekeeper, the family-friendly, object-oriented Python REST library. With beekeeper, even JSON-RPC clients are relatively simple to write. Don't believe me? Read the code. And you can check out `kodipydent/hive.json` to see what a full hive looks like.\n\nHere's the full signature of the method to create your API:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    Kodi(hostname[, port=8080, username='kodi', password=None])\n\n\"Advanced\" Usage\n----------------\n\nkodipydent supports Kodi installations that have usernames and passwords set up. If you've created a password for web access, then simply construct your kodipydent instance as follows:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    Kodi('localhost', username='kodi', password='myawesomepassword')\n\n\n",
