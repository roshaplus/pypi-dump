    "description": "========================\nNRC-LIMS-dataDownloader\n========================\n\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nNRC-LIMS-Datadownloader is a software written in Python. This software explores the NRC-LIMS website, downloads all the sequence files, and keeps the meta data of all the sequences in a sqlite database.\n\nThe list of the tasks performed by the software:\n1. Scrapes the NRC-LIMS website to get a list of all the completed sequence runs and all information related to sequence runs and sequence files.\n2. Obtains new runs that were not been previously downloaded or re-processed/modified runs by checking each sequence run against the database.\n3. Download each new/re-processed run's data and subsequently unzips the file to obtain demultiplexed fastq files\n4. Renames each fastq file to the submitted sample name from the sequencing run information page.\n5. Generates a SHA256 code for each fastq file and gzips the file\n6. Inserts information about newly downlaoded runs and files into database\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n*Python 2.7\n*VirtualEnv\n*GNU Make\n\n\nDeployment Procedures\n---------------------\n\n*Create and start the virtual enviroment \n > cd path/to/your/folder\n > virtualenv -p /path/to/python2.7 venv\n > source venv/bin/activate\n\n*Install the program and all the dependencies\n > pip install NRC-LIMS-dataDownloader \n \n*Copy the sample configuration file _config.ini.sample_ to _config.ini_ and provide the required settings\n > cp config.ini.sample config.ini\n > vim config.ini\n \n*Run the program\n > lims_downloader -c config.ini\n\n\nDeployment Clean up\n--------------------\n\n\n\nTesting\n-------\n\n\n\nSQLite database\n----------------\n\nThree tables are maintained in this database. Tables will be updated when the program is run.\n\n1.data_packages: to keep all the information about each sequence run\n (run-name,....)\n2.data_files: to keep all the information about each sequence file, \ninclude information scrapped from webpage, checksum(SHA256), original name and new name of the file, etc. \n3.program_action: to keep all the information of every time the application is run,\n  like failures, successes, urls scraped/attempted, timestamps, sequence runs downloaded.",
