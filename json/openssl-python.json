    "description": "# openssl-python\n\nThis tool is a command line interface to OpenSSL, written with Python3.\nIt permits encrypting/decrypting files, as well as generating RSA keys, encrypting private RSA keys, signing files using an RSA key, and also verifying signatures using RSA.  \n  \n## Dependencies\n  \nBefore running this tool, the following dependency must be installed, as well as being on the path:\n\n* openssl  \n  \nUsually, this dependency exists by default in most of the supported platforms(see below). In case it doesn't, try consulting the official [OpenSSL documentation](https://www.openssl.org/docs/); or consult your operating system' documentation on how to install new software. \n  \n## Usage\n\nTo launch openssl-python tool, just download the source code, and run the following command:  \n```\npython3 main.py\n```\nOr alternatively, if python is in the path, run the following commands:\n```\nchmod +x main.py\n./main.py\n```\n  \n\n## Platform support\n\nThis tool was initially developed and tested on Linux systems, so it does also support Unix-like systems: BSDs, Mac OS...  \nWindows support though is not guaranteed.",
