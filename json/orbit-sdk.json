    "description": "**PLEASE NOTE** that this SDK is currently for Bynder\u2019s **internal use only**. You will not be able to generate API tokens for your Orbit account yet. We are working on it and this feature will be available soon.\n\n\nBynder Orbit Python SDK\n=======================\n\nThe main goal of this SDK is to speed up the integration of Bynder Orbit\nusers who use Python. Making it easier to connect to the Bynder Orbit\nAPI (`documentation <https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Bynder_BV/Orbit/1.0.0>`_) and execute requests on it.\n\nRequirements and dependencies\n-----------------------------\n\nThe Python SDK requires the following in order to fully work:\n\n-  ``Python >= 3.6``, older versions of Python won't work.\n\nPip should handle all the dependencies automatically.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThis SDK depends on a few libraries in order to work, installing it with\npip should take care of everything automatically.\n\nBefore you install the SDK we recommend you to setup a virtual\nenvironment:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    virtualenv -p python3.6 venv  # create virtual environment\n    source venv/bin/activate      # activate virtual environment\n\nAfter you have successfully setup a virtual environment you can install\nthe SDK with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`__. Run\nthe following command while your virtual environment is active.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip install orbit-sdk\n\nTo use the SDK, you have to import it at the top of your file:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from orbit_sdk import (OrbitClient, Configuration, Token)\n\nHow to use it\n-------------\n\nThis is a simple example on how to retrieve data from Orbit. For a more\ndetailed example of implementation refer to the `sample\ncode <https://github.com/Bynder/orbit-python-sdk/blob/master/example/app.py>`__.\n\nBefore executing any request to the Bynder Orbit API we need to\ninstantiate the **OrbitClient** class. The **OrbitClient** expects a\n**Configuration** and optionally a callback. The configuration can be\nused to configure the client. The callback is a function you can create\nyourself which needs to accept a token as a parameter. Your callback\nfunction will be executed when your access\\_token is expired and a new\none is generated using auto refresh. This allows you to keep track of\nthe latest access and refresh tokens.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n        api_configuration = Configuration(\n            client_id=config.get('ORBIT_API', 'client_id'),\n            client_secret=config.get('ORBIT_API', 'client_secret'),\n            redirect_uri=config.get('ORBIT_API', 'redirect_uri')\n        )\n\n        def callback_func(token):\n            print('New access token: {}'.format(token.access_token))\n            print('New refresh token: {}'.format(token.refresh_token))\n\n        orbit_client = OrbitClient(\n            configuration=api_configuration,\n            callback=callback_func\n        )\n\nWe encourage you to store the tokens in a `configuration\nfile <https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html>`__ or as\nenvrioment variables. This will help you to keep your credentials safe.\n\nAfter getting the **OrbitClient** configured successfully we need to get\nan instance of the **AssetClient** in order to do any of the API calls\nrelative to the Bynder Orbit assets:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n         asset_client = orbit_client.asset_client\n\nAnd with this, we can start our request to the API, listed in the\n**Methods Available** section following. Short example of getting all\nthe **Assets**:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n        assets = asset_client.assets()\n\nThis call will return a list with all the Assets available in Bynder\nOrbit. Note that some of the calls accept a query array in order to\nfilter the results via the API call params. For instance, if we only\nwanted to retrieve **2 images** here is what the call would look like:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n        two_images = asset_client.assets({\n            'limit': 2,\n            'extension': 'jpeg,png'\n        })\n\nMethods Available\n-----------------\n\nThese are the methods currently available on the **Bynder Orbit Python\nSDK**.\n\nOrbitClient:\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe OrbitClient can be used to generate an authorize url and to create\ntokens which you can use to make API requests. If you have valid tokens\nyou can get the asset\\_client to execute API requests relative to the\nAssets in Bynder Orbit.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n        asset_client\n        authorize_url(code_verifier, state)\n        token(code, code_verifier)\n\nAssetClient:\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nAll calls related to the Assets in Bynder Orbit can be executed using\nthe AssetClient.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n        assets()\n        asset_by_id(asset_id)\n        permanent_preview_url(asset_id)\n        download_url(asset_id)\n\nTests\n-----\n\nYou can run the tests by using the command below. This will install the\npackages required and execute the tests for all the clients.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    make test\n\n\n",
