    "description": "npm-accel: Accelerator for npm, the Node.js package manager\n===========================================================\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/xolox/python-npm-accel.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/xolox/python-npm-accel\n\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/xolox/python-npm-accel/badge.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/r/xolox/python-npm-accel?branch=master\n\nThe npm-accel program is a wrapper for npm_ (the Node.js_ package manager) that\nwas created to optimize **one specific use case**: Creating a node_modules_\ndirectory from a package.json_ file as quickly as possible.\n\nIt works on the assumption that you build node_modules directories more\nfrequently then you change the contents of package.json files, because it\ncomputes a fingerprint of the dependencies and uses that fingerprint as a cache\nkey, to cache the complete node_modules directory in a tar archive.\n\nThe program is intended to be used in environments that always or frequently\nstart with an empty node_modules directory and need to populate the complete\ndirectory from scratch (e.g. continuous integration builds and deployments).\nI'm specifically not claiming that you will see any speed improvements if\nyou're updating existing node_modules directories.\n\nThe npm-accel program is currently tested on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and PyPy\n(yes, it's written in Python, deal with it :-P). It's intended to work on UNIX\nsystems like Linux and Mac OS X and specifically won't work on Windows (see\n`supported operating systems`_ for details).\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nStatus\n------\n\nThe npm-accel project was developed and published in September '16 because I\ngot fed up waiting for ``npm install`` to finish, specifically in the context\nof continuous integration builds and deployments (where you frequently start\nwith an empty ``node_modules`` directory). It was developed in about a week\nwithout much prior knowledge about Node.js_ or npm_, which explains why it's\nwritten in Python :-P. On the one hand npm-accel hasn't seen much actual use,\non the other hand it has a test suite with about 95% test coverage and I was\ncareful not to repeat the bugs I encountered in npm-cache_ and\nnpm-fast-install_ while evaluating those tools :-).\n\nTo summarize: Give it a try, see if it actually speeds up your ``npm install``\nuse case and then decide whether you want to use it or not. The first releases\nof npm-accel are labeled as `alpha releases`_ because the program hasn't seen\nmuch real world use (and I'm no expert in Node.js and npm).\n\nPerformance\n-----------\n\nThe following table lists the output of ``npm-accel --benchmark`` (with some\nenhancements) against a private code base with about 30 dependencies listed in\nthe package.json file (resulting in a 401 MB node_modules directory):\n\n=====================  =========  =======================  ==========\nApproach               Iteration  Elapsed time             Percentage\n=====================  =========  =======================  ==========\nnpm install                  1/2  1 minute and 36 seconds      100.0%\nnpm install                  2/2  1 minute and 40 seconds      104.1%\nnpm-accel                    1/2  1 minute and 40 seconds      104.1%\nnpm-accel                    2/2             7.26 seconds        7.5%\nnpm-cache install npm        1/2  3 minutes and 9 seconds      196.8%\nnpm-cache install npm        2/2  2 minutes and 9 seconds      134.3%\nnpm-fast-install             1/2  1 minute and 5 seconds        72.2%\nnpm-fast-install             2/2  1 minute and 6 seconds        73.3%\n=====================  =========  =======================  ==========\n\nSome notes about this benchmark:\n\n- Each of the four installation methods is run twice. The first run starts with\n  empty cache directories and is intended to \"prime the cache\". The second run\n  is intended to actually use the cache and should be able to do so quite\n  effectively, given that the package.json file does not change between the two\n  runs.\n\n- During the benchmark, the caching performed by npm-accel is only used in the\n  fourth row of the table above. This is because the original point of the\n  benchmark (for me) was to find out whether it was even worth it to develop\n  and publish npm-accel. That is to say, if it wouldn't have given a speed\n  improvement it wasn't worth my time, nor yours :-P.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe `npm-accel` package is available on PyPI_ which means installation\nshould be as simple as:\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n\n   $ pip install npm-accel\n\nThere's actually a multitude of ways to install Python packages (e.g. the `per\nuser site-packages directory`_, `virtual environments`_ or just installing\nsystem wide) and I have no intention of getting into that discussion here, so\nif this intimidates you then read up on your options before returning to these\ninstructions ;-).\n\nAlternatively if you are running Arch Linux, npm-accel is `available in AUR`_.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThere are two ways to use the `npm-accel` package: As the command line program\n``npm-accel`` and as a Python API. For details about the Python API please\nrefer to the API documentation available on `Read the Docs`_. The command line\ninterface is described below.\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\n.. A DRY solution to avoid duplication of the `npm-accel --help' text:\n..\n.. [[[cog\n.. from humanfriendly.usage import inject_usage\n.. inject_usage('npm_accel.cli')\n.. ]]]\n\n**Usage:** `npm-accel [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY]`\n\nThe npm-accel program is a wrapper for npm (the Node.js package manager) that optimizes one specific use case: Building a \"node_modules\" directory from a \"package.json\" file as quickly as possible.\n\nIt works on the assumption that you build \"node_modules\" directories more frequently then you change the contents of \"package.json\" files, because it computes a fingerprint of the dependencies and uses that fingerprint as a cache key, to cache the complete \"node_modules\" directory in a tar archive.\n\n**Supported options:**\n\n.. csv-table::\n   :header: Option, Description\n   :widths: 30, 70\n\n\n   \"``-p``, ``--production``\",\"Don't install modules listed in \"\"devDependencies\"\".\"\n   \"``-i``, ``--installer=NAME``\",\"Set the installer to use. Supported values for ``NAME`` are\n   \"\"npm\"\" (the default), \"\"npm-cache\"\" and \"\"npm-fast-install\"\".\"\n   \"``-c``, ``--cache-directory=DIR``\",Set the pathname of the directory where the npm-accel cache is stored.\n   \"``-l``, ``--cache-limit=COUNT``\",\"Set the maximum number of tar archives to preserve. When the cache\n   directory contains more than ``COUNT`` archives the least recently used\n   archives are removed. Defaults to 20.\"\n   \"``-n``, ``--no-cache``\",\"Disallow writing to the cache managed by npm-accel (reading is still\n   allowed though). This option does not disable caching performed by\n   npm-cache and npm-fast-install.\"\n   \"``-b``, ``--benchmark``\",\"Benchmark and compare the following installation methods:\n\n   1. npm install\n   2. npm-accel\n   3. npm-cache\n   4. npm-fast-install\n\n   The first method performs no caching (except for the HTTP caching that's\n   native to npm) while the other three methods each manage their own cache\n   (that is to say, the caching logic of npm-accel will only be used in the\n   second method).\n\n   Warning: Benchmarking wipes the caches managed by npm, npm-accel, npm-cache\n   and npm-fast-install in order to provide a fair comparison (you can\n   override this in the Python API but not on the command line).\"\n   \"``-r``, ``--remote-host=SSH_ALIAS``\",\"Operate on a remote system instead of the local system. The\n   ``SSH_ALIAS`` argument gives the SSH alias of the remote host.\"\n   \"``-v``, ``--verbose``\",Make more noise.\n   \"``-q``, ``--quiet``\",Make less noise.\n   \"``-h``, ``--help``\",\"Show this message and exit.\n   \"\n\n.. [[[end]]]\n\nFuture improvements\n-------------------\n\n**Accelerate installations with changes**\n Currently when the fingerprint (cache key) of the dependencies doesn't match a\n cache entry, the complete caching mechanism is bypassed and a full ``npm\n install`` run is performed. It might be faster to unpack a previous (now\n invalid) cache entry corresponding to the same project and then run ``npm\n install && npm prune``. Given the fact that defining \"same project\" might be\n non-trivial I'm not actually sure this is worth my time.\n\n**Dealing with optionalDependencies**\n I've never seen ``optionalDependencies`` in the wild but encountered them\n while browsing through the package.json_ documentation. Maybe these should be\n part of the computed cache keys aswell?\n\n.. _supported operating systems:\n\nSupported operating systems\n---------------------------\n\nThe npm-accel program was developed to work on UNIX systems like Linux and Mac\nOS X. It requires several external commands to be installed (e.g. ``mkdir``,\n``mv``, ``rm``, ``tar`` and ``which``).\n\nI've tried to keep all of the external command invocations compatible with the\nLinux and BSD variants of commands like tar_, that is to say npm-accel uses\nonly short options and skips the more esoteric features even if they would be\nuseful. If you find that I failed in this respect, please feel free to report\nthis as a bug.\n\nFor posterity: It was a conscious decision (for several reasons) to use the\ntar_ program instead of manipulating tar archives via Python's `tarfile\nmodule`_.\n\nContact\n-------\n\nThe latest version of `npm-accel` is available on PyPI_ and GitHub_. The\ndocumentation is hosted on `Read the Docs`_. For bug reports please create an\nissue on GitHub_. If you have questions, suggestions, etc. feel free to send me\nan e-mail at `peter@peterodding.com`_.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis software is licensed under the `MIT license`_.\n\n\u00a9 2016 Peter Odding.\n\n\n..
