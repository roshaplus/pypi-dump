    "description": "This package is designed to make simulating ordinary and stochastic Gaussian master equations as straightforward as possible. Specifically, given bath statistics, a coupling operator, and initial conditions, it can output the equation as a system of coupled real-valued equations suitable for a numerical integrator of choice, and provides some default integrators.",
