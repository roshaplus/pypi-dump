    "description": "Welcome to Pyslet\n=================\n\n..  note::\n    You are reading documentation for the pyslet-0.6.20160201 release of\n    Pyslet to PyPi. The latest version, corresponding to the GitHub\n    master is available here__\n    \n    ..  __: http://pyslet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n\nPyslet_ is a Python package for Standards in Learning Education and\nTraining (LET). It implements a number of LET-specific standards,\nincluding IMS QTI, Content Packaging and Basic LTI.  It also includes\nsupport for some general standards, including the data access standard\nOData (see http://www.odata.org).\n\n..  _Pyslet: http://www.pyslet.org\n\nPyslet was originally written to be the engine behind the QTI migration\ntool but it can be used independently as a support module for your own\nPython applications.\n\nFull documentation is hosted at http://pyslet.readthedocs.org\n\nPyslet currently supports Python 2.6 and 2.7, see docs for details.\n\n  \n\nDistribution\n------------\n\nPyslet is developed on GitHub: https://github.com/swl10/pyslet but it\ncan be downloaded and installed from the popular PyPi package\ndistribution site: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyslet using *pip*.\n\nWhile Pyslet is being actively developed the version on PyPi may lag\na few months behind the master branch on GitHub.  The unittests are\nfairly comprehensive and are automatically run against the master\nbranch using TravisCI_:\n\n.. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/swl10/pyslet.png\n   :alt: Build Status\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/swl10/pyslet\n\n.. _TravisCI: https://travis-ci.org/swl10/pyslet\n\nUsers of older Python builds (e.g., the current Python 2.6 installed on\nOS X as of August 2014) should be aware that pip may well fail to\ninstall itself or other modules due to a failure to connect to the PyPi\nrepository.  Fixing this is hard and installing from source is\nrecommended instead if you are afflicted by this issue.\n\n\nInstalling from Source\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Pyslet package contains a setup.py script so you can install it\nby downloading the compressed archive, uncompressing it and then\nrunning the following command inside the package::\n\n    python setup.py install\n\n\nCurrent Status & Road Map\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPyslet is going through a transition process at the moment as the QTI\nmigration tool that drives its development is gradually moving towards\nbeing distributed as an LTI tool rather than a desktop application.\n\nThe OData support is fairly robust, it is used to run the Cambridge Weather\nOData service which can be found at http://odata.pyslet.org/weather\n\nWhat's next?\n\n*   MySQL shim for the OData SQL storage model (90% complete and\n    functional)\n\n*   Improved support for LTI to take it beyond 'basic' (60% complete)\n\n*   Python 3 support (10% complete)\n\nI'm also slowly transforming the code for better PEP-8 compliance as\nreported by the fantastic flake8_.  For important information about how\nthis affects existing Pyslet users see the What's New? section of the\ndocumentation or the CHANGES.rst file in the distribution package. \n\n..  _flake8: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8\n\nI also write about Pyslet on my blog:\nhttp://swl10.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/Pyslet\n\n\nFeedback\n~~~~~~~~\n\nThe best way to get something changed is to create an issue or Pull\nrequest on GitHub, however, my contact details are available there on my\nprofile page if you just want to drop me an email with a suggestion or\nquestion.\n\n\nLicense\n~~~~~~~\n\nPyslet is distributed under the 'New' BSD license:\nhttp://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause, this decision was inherited\nfrom the early days of the code.  Although Copyright to much of the\nsource is owned by the author personally earlier parts are owned by the\nUniversity of Cambridge and are marked as such.\n\nPyslet is written and maintained by the main author on a spare time\nbasis and is not connected to my current employer.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSome historical information is available on the QTI Migration tool's\nGoogle Code project:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/qtimigration/\n\nSome of the code was written almost 20 years ago and it owes a lot to\nthe University of Cambridge and, in particular, to the team I worked\nwith at UCLES (aka Cambridge Assessment) who were instrumental in\ngetting this project started.",
