Also you can install the very latest version straight from the sources:\n        \n          .. code-block:: bash\n        \n              $ pip install git+git://github.com/ankostis/wltp.git  --pre\n        \n        - If you want to upgrade an existing instalation along with all its dependencies,\n          add also option(`--upgrade`) (or option(`-U`) equivalently), but then the build might take some\n          considerable time to finish.  Also there is the possibility the upgraded libraries might break\n          existing programs(!) so use it with caution, or from within a |virtualenv|_.\n        \n        - To install it for different Python environments, repeat the procedure using\n          the appropriate program(`python.exe`) interpreter for each environment.\n        \n        - .. Tip::\n            To debug installation problems, you can export a non-empty envvar(`DISTUTILS_DEBUG`)\n            and *distutils* will print detailed information about what it is doing and/or\n            print the whole command line when an external program (like a C compiler) fails.\n        \n        \n        After installation, it is important that you check which version is visible in your envvar(`PATH`):\n        \n        .. code-block:: bash\n        \n            $ wltp --version\n            0.1.0-alpha.2\n        \n        \n        To install for different Python versions, repeat the procedure for every required version.\n        \n        \n        \n        Older versions\n        --------------\n        An additional purpose of the versioning schema of the project is to track which specific version\n        of the GTR it implements.\n        Given a version number ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``, the ``MAJOR`` part tracks the GTR phase implemented.\n        See the \"GTR version matrix\" section in doc(`CHANGES`) for the mapping of MAJOR-numbers to GTR versions.\n        \n        To install an older released version issue the console command:\n        \n        .. code-block:: bash\n        \n            $ pip install wltp=1.1.1                    ## Use `--pre` if version-string has a build-suffix.\n        \n        or alternatively straight from the sources:\n        \n        .. code-block:: bash\n        \n            $ pip install git+git://github.com/ankostis/wltp.git@v0.0.9-alpha.3.1  --pre\n        \n        Ofcourse you can substitute `v0.0.9-alpha.3.1` with any slug from \"commits\", \"branches\" or \"releases\"\n        that you will find on project's `github-repo <https://github.com/ankostis/wltp>`_).\n        \n        .. Note::\n            If you have another version already installed, you have to use option(`--ignore-installed`) (or option(`-I`)).\n            For using the specific version, check this (untested)\n            `stackoverflow question <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6445167/force-python-to-use-an-older-version-of-module-than-what-i-have-installed-now>`_ .\n        \n            You can install each version in a separate |virtualenv|_ and shy away from all this.\n            Check\n        \n        \n        Installing from sources\n        -----------------------\n        If you download the sources you have more options for installation.\n        There are various methods to get hold of them:\n        \n        * Download the *source* distribution from |pypi|_.\n        * Download a `release-snapshot from github <https://github.com/ankostis/wltp/releases>`_\n        * Clone the *git-repository* at *github*.\n        \n          Assuming you have a working installation of `git <http://git-scm.com/>`_\n          you can fetch and install the latest version of the project with the following series of commands:\n        \n          .. code-block:: bash\n        \n              $ git clone \"https://github.com/ankostis/wltp.git\" wltp.git\n              $ cd wltp.git\n              $ python setup.py install                                 ## Use `python3` if both python-2 & 3 installed.\n        \n        \n        When working with sources, you need to have installed all libraries that the project depends on:\n        \n        .. code-block:: bash\n        \n            $ pip install -r requirements/execution.txt .\n        \n        \n        The previous command installs a \"snapshot\" of the project as it is found in the sources.\n        If you wish to link the project's sources with your python environment, install the project\n        in `development mode <http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#development-mode>`_:\n        \n        .. code-block:: bash\n        \n            $ python setup.py develop\n        \n        \n        ..

To have precise control over the inputs and outputs\n        (i.e. experiments in a \"batch\" and/or in a design of experiments)\n        you have to run the experiments using the API python, as explained below.\n        \n        \n        The entry-point script is called program(`wltp`), and it must have been placed in your envvar(`PATH`)\n        during installation.  This script can construct a *model* by reading input-data\n        from multiple files and/or overriding specific single-value items.

Note:: You may reverse the procedure described above and run the python-script instead.\n            The script will open the excel-file, run the experiments and add the new sheets, but in case any errors occur,\n            this time you can debug them, if you had executed the script through *LiClipse*, or *IPython*!\n        \n        Some general notes regarding the python-code from excel-cells:\n        \n        * On each invocation, the predefined VBA module `pandalon` executes a dynamically generated python-script file\n          in the same folder where the excel-file resides, which, among others, imports the \"sister\" python-script file.\n          You can read & modify the sister python-script to import libraries such as 'numpy' and 'pandas',\n          or pre-define utility python functions.\n        * The name of the sister python-script is automatically calculated from the name of the Excel-file,\n          and it must be valid as a python module-name.  Therefore do not use non-alphanumeric characters such as\n          spaces(` `), dashes(`-`) and dots(`.`) on the Excel-file.\n        * On errors, a log-file is written in the same folder where the excel-file resides,\n          for as long as **the message-box is visible, and it is deleted automatically after you click 'ok'!**\n        * Read http://docs.xlwings.org/quickstart.html\n        \n        \n        .. _python-usage:\n        \n        Python usage\n        ------------\n        Example python REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) example-commands  are given below\n        that setup and run an *experiment*.\n        \n        First run command(`python`) or command(`ipython`) and try to import the project to check its version:\n        \n        code-block::\n        \n            >>> import wltp\n        \n            >>> wltp.__version__            ## Check version once more.\n            '0.1.0-alpha.2'\n        \n            >>> wltp.__file__               ## To check where it was installed.         # doctest: +SKIP\n            /usr/local/lib/site-package/wltp-...\n        \n        \n        .. Tip:\n            The use command(`ipython`) is preffered over command(`python`) since it offers various user-friendly\n            facilities, such as pressing kbd(`Tab`) for completions, or allowing you to suffix commands with `?` or `??`\n            to get help and read their source-code.\n        \n            Additionally you can <b>copy any python commands starting with ``>>>`` and ``...``</b> and copy paste them directly\n            into the ipython interpreter; it will remove these prefixes.\n            But in command(`python`) you have to remove it youself.\n        \n        If everything works, create the **pandas-model** that will hold the input-data (strings and numbers)\n        of the experiment.  You can assemble the model-tree by the use of:\n        \n        * sequences,\n        * dictionaries,\n        * class(`pandas.DataFrame`),\n        * class(`pandas.Series`), and\n        * URI-references to other model-trees.\n        \n        \n        For instance:\n        \n        code-block::\n        \n            >>> from wltp import model\n            >>> from wltp.experiment import Experiment\n            >>> from collections import OrderedDict as odic         ## It is handy to preserve keys-order.\n        \n            >>> mdl = odic(\n            ...   vehicle = odic(\n            ...     unladen_mass = 1430,\n            ...     test_mass    = 1500,\n            ...     v_max        = 195,\n            ...     p_rated      = 100,\n            ...     n_rated      = 5450,\n            ...     n_idle       = 950,\n            ...     n_min        = None,                            ## Manufacturers my overridde it\n            ...     gear_ratios         = [120.5, 75, 50, 43, 37, 32],\n            ...     resistance_coeffs   = [100, 0.5, 0.04],\n            ...   )\n            ... )\n        \n        \n        For information on the accepted model-data, check its **JSON-schema**:\n        \n        code-block::\n        \n            >>> model.json_dumps(model.model_schema(), indent=2)                                # doctest: +SKIP\n            {\n              \"properties\": {\n                \"params\": {\n                  \"properties\": {\n                    \"f_n_min_gear2\": {\n                      \"description\": \"Gear-2 is invalid when N :< f_n_min_gear2 * n_idle.\",\n                      \"type\": [\n                        \"number\",\n                        \"null\"\n                      ],\n                      \"default\": 0.9\n                    },\n                    \"v_stopped_threshold\": {\n                      \"description\": \"Velocity (Km/h) under which (<=) to idle gear-shift (Annex 2-3.3, p71).\",\n                      \"type\": [\n            ...\n        \n        \n        You then have to feed this model-tree to the class(`~wltp.experiment.Experiment`)\n        constructor.

A `ipython-notebook server <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_ >= v2.x.x is installed for  *python-3*,\n           it is up, and running.\n        b.

Admonition:: Virtualenv\n            :class: note\n        \n            You may choose to work in a |virtualenv|_,\n            to install dependency libraries isolated from system's ones, and/or without *admin-rights*\n            (this is recommended for *Linux*/*Mac OS*).\n        \n            .. Attention::\n                If you decide to reuse stystem-installed packages using  option(`--system-site-packages`)\n                with ``virtualenv <= 1.11.6``\n                (to avoid, for instance, having to reinstall *numpy* and *pandas* that require native-libraries)\n                you may be bitten by `bug #461 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/461>`_ which\n                prevents you from upgrading any of the pre-installed packages with command(`pip`).\n        \n        .. Admonition:: Liclipse IDE\n            :class: note\n        \n            Within the sources there are two sample files for the comprehensive\n            `LiClipse IDE <http://www.liclipse.com/>`_:\n        \n            * file(`eclipse.project`)\n            * file(`eclipse.pydevproject`)\n        \n            Remove the `eclipse` prefix, (but leave the dot(`.`)) and import it as \"existing project\" from\n            Eclipse's `File` menu.\n        \n            Another issue is caused due to the fact that LiClipse contains its own implementation of *Git*, *EGit*,\n            which badly interacts with unix *symbolic-links*, such as the file(`docs/docs`), and it detects\n            working-directory changes even after a fresh checkout.  To workaround this, Right-click on the above file\n            ``Properties --> Team --> Advanced --> Assume Unchanged``\n        \n        \n        Then you can install all project's dependencies in *`development mode* using the file(`setup.py`) script:\n        \n        .. code-block:: console\n        \n            $ python setup.py --help                           ## Get help for this script.\n            Common commands: (see '--help-commands' for more)\n        \n              setup.py build      will build the package underneath 'build/'\n              setup.py install    will install the package\n        \n            Global options:\n              --verbose (-v)      run verbosely (default)\n              --quiet (-q)        run quietly (turns verbosity off)\n              --dry-run (-n)      don't actually do anything\n            ...\n        \n            $ python setup.py develop                           ## Also installs dependencies into project's folder.\n            $ python setup.py build                             ## Check that the project indeed builds ok.\n        \n        \n        You should now run the test-cases (see doc(`metrics`)) to check\n        that the sources are in good shape:\n        \n        .. code-block:: console\n        \n           $ python setup.py test\n        \n        \n        .. Note:: The above commands installed the dependencies inside the project folder and\n            for the *virtual-environment*.  That is why all build and testing actions have to go through\n            ``python setup.py {some_cmd}``.\n        \n            If you are dealing with installation problems and/or you want to permantly install dependant packages,\n            you have to *deactivate* the virtual-environment and start installing them into your *base*\n            python environment:\n        \n            .. code-block:: console\n        \n               $ deactivate\n               $ python setup.py develop\n        \n            or even try the more *permanent* installation-mode:\n        \n            .. code-block:: console\n        \n               $ python setup.py install                # May require admin-rights\n        \n        \n        \n        Development procedure\n        ---------------------\n        For submitting code, use ``UTF-8`` everywhere, unix-eol(``LF``) and set ``git --config core.autocrlf = input``.\n        \n        The typical development procedure is like this:\n        \n        1. Modify the sources in small, isolated and well-defined changes, i.e.\n           adding a single feature, or fixing a specific bug.\n        2. Add test-cases \"proving\" your code.\n        3. Rerun all test-cases to ensure that you didn't break anything,\n           and check their *coverage* remain above 80%:\n        \n           .. code-block:: console\n        \n                $ python setup.py nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package wltp.model,wltp.experiment --cover-min-percentage=80\n        \n        \n           .. Tip:: You can enter just: ``python setup.py test_all`` instead of the above cmd-line\n               since it has been *aliased* in the file(`setup.cfg`) file.\n               Check this file for more example commands to use during development.\n        \n        \n        4. If you made a rather important modification, update also the doc(`CHANGES`) file and/or\n           other documents (i.e. README.rst).  To see the rendered results of the documents,\n           issue the following commands and read the result html at file(`build/sphinx/html/index.html`):\n        \n           .. code-block:: console\n        \n                $ python setup.py build_sphinx                  # Builds html docs\n                $ python setup.py build_sphinx -b doctest       # Checks if python-code embeded in comments runs ok.\n        \n        5. If there are no problems, commit your changes with a descriptive message.\n        \n        6. Repeat this cycle for other bugs/enhancements.\n        7. When you are finished, push the changes upstream to *github* and make a *merge_request*.\n           You can check whether your merge-request indeed passed the tests by checking\n           its build-status |build-status| on the integration-server's site (TravisCI).\n        \n           ..
