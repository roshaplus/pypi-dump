    "description": "\n.. _corelight-client:\n\n.. Version number is filled in automatically.\n.. |version| replace:: 1.1.1\n\n====================================\nCorelight Sensor Command Line Client\n====================================\n\n.. contents::\n\nOverview\n========\n\nThis tool provides a command-line client for the `Corelight Sensor\n<https://www.corelight.com>`_, a `Bro <https://www.bro.org>`_\nappliance engineered from the ground up by Bro's creators to transform\nnetwork traffic into high-fidelity data for your analytics pipeline.\nUsing the command-line client, you can configure and control a\nCorelight Sensor remotely through its comprehensive RESTful API. See\nthe Corelight Sensor documentation for an extended version of this\nclient overview.\n\n:Version: |version|\n:Home: http://www.corelight.com\n:GitHub: https://github.com/corelight/corelight-client\n:Author: `Corelight, Inc. <https://www.corelight.com>`_ <info@corelight.com>\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nThis client is open-source under a BSD license. See ``COPYING`` for\ndetails.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nThe command-line client needs Python >= 3.4 with the ``requests``\nmodule installed as its main dependency.\n\nThe easiest way to install the client is through the Python Package\nIndex::\n\n    # pip3 install corelight-client\n\nAlternatively, you can install the latest version from GitHub::\n\n    # git clone https://github.com/corelight/corelight-client\n    # cd corelight-client\n    # python3 setup.py install\n\nIf everything is installed correctly, ``--help`` will give you a usage\nmessage::\n\n    # corelight-client --help\n    Usage: corelight-client [<global options>] <command> <subcommand> [<options>]\n              [--ssl-ca-cert SSL_CA_CERT] [--ssl-no-verify-certificate]\n              [--ssl-no-verify-hostname] [--cache CACHE]\n    [...]\n\nNote that initially, ``--help`` will not yet show you any further\ncommands to use. Proceed to the next section to let the client connect\nto your device.\n\nAccess and Authentication\n=========================\n\nYou need to enable access to the Corelight API through the device's\nconfiguration interface. You also need to set passwords for the API\nusers ``admin`` (for unlimited access) and ``monitor`` (for read-only\naccess). See the Corelight Sensor documentation for more information.\n\nNext, you need to tell the ``corelight-client`` the network address of\nyour Corelight Sensor. You have three choices for doing that:\n\n- Add ``-b <address>`` to the command-line.\n\n- Create a configuration file ``~/.corelight-client.rc`` with the content\n  ``device=<address>``.\n\n- Set the environment variable ``CORELIGHT_DEVICE=<address>``.\n\nIf that's all set up, ``corelight-client --help`` will now ask you for a\nusername and password, and then show you the full list of commands\nthat the device API enables the client to offer. If you confirm saving\nthe credentials, the client will store them in\n``~/.corelight-client/credentials`` for future reuse. You can also specify\nauthentication information through the `Configuration File`_ or as\n`Global Options`_.\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThe client offers the API's functionality through a set of commands of\nthe format ``<command> <subcommand> [options]``. By adding ``--help``\nto any command, you get a description of all its functionality and\noptions.\n\nIf the ``--help`` output lists a command's option as being of type\n``file``, the client requires you to specify the path to a file to\nsend. In addition, you can prefix any option's value with ``file://``\nto read its content from a file instead of giving it on the\ncommand-line itself.\n\n(Note: The ``--help`` output will contain the list of commands only if\nthe client can connect, and authenticate, to the device.)\n\n.. _corelight-client-options:\n\nGlobal Options\n--------------\n\nThe ``corelight-client`` supports the following global command-line\noptions with all operations:\n\n``--async``\n    Does not wait for asynchronous commands to complete before exiting.\n\n``--device``\n    Specifies the network address of the Corelight Sensor device.\n\n``--cache=<file>``\n    Sets a custom file for caching Corelight Sensor meta data.\n\n``--debug``\n    Enables debugging output showing HTTP requests and replies.\n\n``--password``\n    Specifies the password for authentication.\n\n``--ssl-ca-cert``\n    Specifies a file containing a custom SSL CA certificate for\n    validating the device's authenticity.\n\n``--ssl-no-verify-certificate``\n    Instructs the client to accept any Corelight Sensor SSL certificate.\n\n``--ssl-no-verify-hostname``\n    Instructs the client to accept the Corelight Sensor's SSL certificate\n    even if it does not match its hostname.\n\n``--user``\n    Specifies the user name for authentication.\n\n``--version``\n    Displays the version of the ``corelight-client`` and exits.\n\n\n.. _corelight-client-config:\n\nConfiguration File\n==================\n\nThe ``corelight-client`` looks for a configuration file ``~/.corelight-client.rc``.\nThe file must consist of lines ``<key>=<value>``. Comments starting\nwith ``#`` are ignored. ``corelight-client`` support the following keys:\n\n``device``\n    The network address of the Corelight Sensor device.\n\n``user``\n    The user name for authentication.\n\n``password``\n    The password for authentication.\n\n``ssl-ca-cert``\n    A file containing a custom SSL CA certificate for validating the device's\n    authenticity.\n\n``ssl-no-verify-certificate``\n    If set to ``false``, the client will accept any Corelight Sensor's SSL\n    certificate.\n\n``ssl-no-verify-hostname``\n    If set to ``false``, the client will accept the Corelight Sensor's SSL\n    certificate even if it does not match its hostname.\n\n\n\n\n",
