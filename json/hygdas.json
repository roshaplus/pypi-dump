    "description": "HygDAS is a database management system based on \n      graph/hypergraph model as the underlying data model. At the lowest end of \n      a hypergraph-based model is a set of primitive nodes and its attributes \n      (data values). Primitive nodes can related to each other via edges (with \n      relevant attributes). Primitive nodes can also be aggregated into a set of\n      nodes, known as hypernodes, which can be linked to eachother via edges \n      (with relevant attributes). Related edges can be aggregated into a set of \n      edges, known as hyperedge.",
