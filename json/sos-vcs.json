SCM) can do, not only inside a Subversion base folder, but in any (and even multiple) folders of your file system, be it inside or outside of repository checkouts.\n\n[SOS](https://github.com/ArneBachmann/sos) augments [SVN](http://subversion.apache.org) with offline operation and thus serves the same need as [RCS](http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/), [CVS](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/cvs), [Git](https://git-scm.com), [gitless](http://gitless.com), [Bazaar](http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/), [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org), and [Fossil](http://www.fossil-scm.org).\n\n\n## How it works ##\nThis tool can be used *a)* as a drop-in replacement for `svn` and other VCS commands, *b)* as an offline VCS extension for those that don't support it natively, or *c)* as a standalone VCS.\n\nSOS will double as any popular SCM command line tool and can execute any `svn`, `git` or other VCS commands by simply calling `sos <command> [<arguments-and-options>]`, e.g. `sos commit -m \"Message\"` instead of `svn commit -m \"Message\"`. This works by auto-detecting the type of encompassing VCS of the folder you are running `sos` from.\nOnce you executed `sos offline`, however, all commands are interpreted by the SOS tool instead, until leaving the offline mode by `sos online` (details below).\n\nSOS supports three different file handling approaches that you may use to your liking, thus being able to mirror the file handling philosophies of different VCSs, including one new mode for super quick and easy version management.\n- **Simple mode** (default): All files are automatically committed and \"tracked\", but changes between branches/revisions will always be replayed in the life file tree (files will always be added or removed depending on operation)\n- **Tracking mode**: Only files that match certain file name tracking patterns are respected at `commit`, `update` and `branch` (just like SVN, gitless, and Fossil do), requiring users to specifically add or remove files to a branch\n- **Picky mode**: Each operation needs the explicit declaration of file name patterns to work on (like Git does).\n\n\n## Comparison with traditional VCS ##\n- `switch` works like `checkout` in Git or `update to revision` in SVN\n- `update` works a bit like `pull` in Git or `update` in SVN\n\n\n## Commit semantics ##\n- Committing always creates a new revision with an incremented index.\n\n\n## Update and merge semantics ##\nThere are several level of consideration:\n- File addition/removal per revision, e.g. when updating from another branch and/or revision or switching to them\n- Line insertion/deletion per file, e.g. when merging file modifications during update\n- Character insertion/deletion per line, e.g. when non-conflicting intra-line differences are detected\n- Updating in track or picky mode will always integrate tracked file patterns. To revert this, use the `switch --meta` command to pull back in another branch's or revision's tracking patterns.\n\n\n## Config options ##\n- `strict`: Flag for always performing full file comparsion, not relying on file size and modification timestamp only. Default: False\n- `track`: Flag for always going offline in tracking mode (SVN-style). Default: False\n- `picky`: Flag for always going offline in picky mode (Git-styly). Default: False\n- `compress`: Flag for compressing versioned artifacts. Default: True\n- `defaultbranch`: Name of the initial branch created when going offline. Default: Dynamic per type of VCS in current working directory (e.g. `master` for Git, `trunk` for SVN)\n- `texttype`: Semicolon-separated list of glob patterns for file names that should be recognized as text files that can be merged through textual diff, in addition to what Python's `mimetypes` library can do. Default: Empty\n- `bintype`: Semicolon-separated list of glob patterns for file names that should be recognized as binary files that cannot be merged through textual diff. Default: Empty\n- `ignores`: List of glob patterns for files to ignore during commit/diff/changes/update etc.\n- `ignoresWhitelist`: List of glob patterns that allow files to be added although captured by a blacklist pattern from `ignores`\n- `ignoreDirs`: As `ignores`, but for folder names\n- `ignoreDirsWhitelist`: As `ignoresWhitelist`, but for folder names\n\n## Branch semantics ##\n- SOS always branches from a branch's last revision. Exception: Simple mode always considers current file tree instead, unless TODO --last for tracked mode?\n\n    There may be, however, blocks of text lines that seem inserted/deleted but may have actually just been moved inside the file. SOS attempts to detect clear cases of moved blocks and silently accepts them no matter what.\n\nLevels of interactive merging:\n- One rule set for entire revision\n- One rule set per file\n- One decision per block of lines\n- Conflict resolution decision per conflicted line\n\n\n## Noteworthy details ##\n- There is no relation between a checkout, branch point and any committed revision.\n- Branches are always created from current file system state and have no reference to other branches or specific revisions\n- Updating is allowed even if uncommitted changes are connected (no matter if from last revision or after switching to any other revision)\n- Python 2 support was ditched completely, as type safety was difficult to guarantee and external library support also missing\n\n## User configuration and defaults ##\nSOS optionally uses the [`configr`]() library to manage per-user global defaults for the `--strict`, `--track` and `--picky` parameters that the `offline` command takes.\nBy means of the `sos config set <key> <value>` command, you can set the `strict`, `track` or `picky` flag with values like `1`, `yes`, `on`, `true`.\nIt's also possible to define a per-user global defaults for file and folder exclude patterns.\n\n\n## Tipps ##\n- It may be a good idea to go offline one folder higher up in the file tree than your base working folder to care for potential deletions or renames\n- Switching inside a branch never modifies the tracking patterns, as they are not linked to any specific revision\n\n\n## Release management ##\n- Run `python3 setup.py build` to test the code and increment the version number\n- Run `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` and let Travis CI run the tests for different target platforms. If there were no problems, continue:\n- Run `python3 setup.py sdist` to package the module with previously generated version info\n- Run `twine upload dist/*.tar.gz` to upload the module to PyPI.\n\n\n## Todos ##\n- diff and merge ignore EOL style during combination\n- all doctests have been moved to `tests.py`\n- `sos.coco` should be <= 1000 LOC, but is currently larger\n- create better looking landing page to build community support\n- branching may be expensive as all files are copied\n- diffCommand = \"diff -d {old!s} {new!s}\"  # requires diffutils on OpenSUSE\n- mergeCommand = \"merge -A -L z -L a -L b c a b\"  # requires rce on OpenSUSE\n- [Answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4934208/working-offline-with-svn-on-local-machine-temporary) when published",
