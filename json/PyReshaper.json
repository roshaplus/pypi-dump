    "description": "The PyReshaper\n==============\n\nA package for converting NetCDF files from time-slice (history) format \nto time-series (single-variable) format.\n\n:AUTHORS: John Dennis, Sheri Mickelson, Kevin Paul, Haiying Xu\n:COPYRIGHT: 2016, University Corporation for Atmospheric Research\n:LICENSE: See the LICENSE.rst file for details\n\nSend questions and comments to Kevin Paul (kpaul@ucar.edu).\n\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nThe PyReshaper is a tool for converting time-slice (or history-file\nor synoptically) formatted NetCDF files into time-series (or single-field)\nformat.  The PyReshaper package is designed to run in parallel (MPI) to\nmaximize performance, with the parallelism implemented over variables\n(i.e., task parallelism).  This means that the maximum parallelism\nachieveable for a given operation is one core/processor per variables in\nthe time-slice NetCDF files.\n\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nThe PyReshaper directly depends upon the ASAP Python Toolbox (ASAPTools)\nand either PyNIO or netcdf4-python.  Access and manipulation of the NetCDF\nfiles is done through PyNIO or netcdf4-python, and the parallelism is \nimplimented using the ASAPTools SimpleComm, which uses mpi4py.  Implicit\ndependencies exist as a result of these direct dependencies.\n\nThe PyReshaper explicitly depends upon the following Python packages:\n\n-  PyNIO (v1.4.1+) or netCDF4-python (v1.2+)\n-  ASAPPyTools (v0.4+)\n\nThese packages imply a dependency on the NumPy (v1.4+) and mpi4py (v1.3+) \npackages, and the  libraries NetCDF and MPI/MPI-2.\n    \nAdditionally, the entire package is designed to work with Python v2.6 and up\nto (but not including) Python v3.0.  If using Python version 2.6, you will\nneed to install the ``ordereddict`` package, too.\n \nThe version requirements have not been rigidly tested, so earlier versions\nmay actually work.  No version requirement is made during installation, though,\nso problems might occur if an earlier versions of these packages have been\ninstalled.\n\n\nEasy Installation with PIP\n--------------------------\n\nThe easiest way to install the ASAP Python Toolbox is from the Python\nPackage Index (PyPI) with the pip package manager::\n\n    $  pip install [--user] PyReshaper\n    \nThe optional '--user' argument can be used to install the package in the\nlocal user's directory, which is useful if the user doesn't have root\nprivileges.\n\nOne should be careful, however, as the PyPI packages may not always be up\nto date.  We recommend obtaining the most recent versions of the PyReshaper\nfrom the GitHub site shown in the section below.\n\n\nObtaining the Source Code\n-------------------------\n\nCurrently, the most up-to-date development source code is available\nvia git from the site::\n\n    https://github.com/NCAR/PyReshaper\n\nYou may then check out the most recent stable tag.  The source is available in\nread-only mode to everyone.  Developers are welcome to update the source\nand submit Pull Requests via GitHub.\n\n\nBuilding & Installing from Source\n---------------------------------\n\nInstallation of the PyReshaper is very simple.  After checking out the source\nfrom the above svn link, via::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/NCAR/PyReshaper\n    \nEnter the newly cloned directory::\n\n    $ cd PyReshaper\n\nThen, run the Python setuptools setup script.  On unix, this involves::\n\n    $  python setup.py install [--prefix=/path/to/install/location]\n    \nThe prefix is optional, as the default prefix is typically /usr/local on\nlinux machines.  However, you must have permissions to write to the prefix\nlocation, so you may want to choose a prefix location where you have write\npermissions.  Like most distutils installations, you can alternatively\ninstall the PyReshaper with the '--user' option, which will automatically\nselect (and create if it does not exist) the $HOME/.local directory in which\nto install.  To do this, type (on unix machines)::\n\n    $  python setup.py install --user\n    \nThis can be handy since the site-packages directory will be common for all\nuser installs, and therefore only needs to be added to the ``PYTHONPATH`` once.\n\nTo install the documentation, you must have Sphinx installed on your system.\nSphinx can be easily installed with pip, via::\n\n    $  pip install Sphinx\n    \nOnce Sphinx is installed, you can build the PyReshaper HTML documentation\nwith::\n\n    $  cd docs\n    $  make html\n\nThe resulting HTML documentation will be placed in the docs/build/html\ndirectory, and the main page can be loaded with any browser pointing to\n'docs/build/html/index.html'.\n\n\nBefore Using the PyReshaper Package\n-----------------------------------\n\nBefore the PyReshaper package can be used, you must make sure that the \nsite-packages directory containing the 'pyreshaper' source directory is in\nyour PYTHONPATH.  Depending on the PREFIX used during installation, this\npath will be::\n\n    $PREFIX/lib/python2.X/site-packages\n\nwhere X will be 6 or 7 (or other) depending on the version of Python that you\nare using to install the package.\n\nTo use the PyReshaper scripts (e.g., 's2smake' and 's2srun'), you must add the\nscript binary directory to your PATH.  Depending on the PREFIX used during\ninstallation, this path will be::\n\n    $PREFIX/bin/\n    \nOnce the script binary directory has been added to your PATH and the \nsite-packages directory has been added to your PYTHONPATH, you may use the\nPyReshaper package without issue.\n\n\nInstructions & Use\n------------------\n\nPlease see the more detailed instructions found in the docs/ directory for\nusage and examples.  See the 'Building & Installing from Source' section \nfor how to build the documentation with Sphinx. \n\n",
