    "description": "Currency converter\n==================\n\nThis is a currency converter that uses historical rates against a reference currency (Euro).\n\nCurrency data sources\n---------------------\n\nThe default source is the `European Central Bank <http://www.ecb.int/>`_. This is the ECB historical rates for 42 currencies against the Euro since 1999.\nIt can be downloaded here: `eurofxref-hist.zip <http://www.ecb.int/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-hist.zip>`_.\nThe converter can use different sources as long as the format is the same.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can install directly after cloning:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n $ python setup.py install --user\n\nOr use the Python package:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  $ pip install --user currencyconverter\n\nCommand line tool\n-----------------\n\nAfter installation, you should have ``currency_converter`` in your ``$PATH``:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n $ currency_converter 100 USD --to EUR\n 100.000 USD = 87.512 EUR on 2016-05-06\n\nPython API\n----------\n\nCreate once the currency converter object:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> from currency_converter import CurrencyConverter\n    >>> c = CurrencyConverter()\n\nConvert from ``EUR`` to ``USD`` using the last available rate:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> c.convert(100, 'EUR', 'USD') # doctest: +SKIP\n    137.5...\n\nDefault target currency is ``EUR``:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> c.convert(100, 'EUR')\n    100.0\n    >>> c.convert(100, 'USD') # doctest: +SKIP\n    72.67...\n\nYou can change the date of the rate:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> from datetime import date # datetime works too\n    >>> c.convert(100, 'EUR', 'USD', date=date(2013, 3, 21))\n    129...\n\nFallbacks\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nSome rates are missing:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> c.convert(100, 'BGN', date=date(2010, 11, 21))\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    RateNotFoundError: BGN has no rate for 2010-11-21\n\nBut we have a fallback mode for those, using a linear interpolation of the\nclosest known rates, as long as you ask for a date within the currency date bounds:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> c = CurrencyConverter(fallback_on_missing_rate=True)\n    >>> c.convert(100, 'BGN', date=date(2010, 11, 21))\n    51.12...\n\nWe also have a fallback mode for dates outside the currency bounds:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> c = CurrencyConverter()\n    >>> c.convert(100, 'EUR', 'USD', date=date(1986, 2, 2))\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    RateNotFoundError: 1986-02-02 not in USD bounds 1999-01-04/2016-04-29\n    >>> \n    >>> c = CurrencyConverter(fallback_on_wrong_date=True)\n    >>> c.convert(100, 'EUR', 'USD', date=date(1986, 2, 2)) # fallback to 1999-01-04\n    117.89...\n\nOther attributes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n+ ``bounds`` lets you know the first and last available date for each currency\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> first_date, last_date = c.bounds['USD']\n    >>> first_date\n    datetime.date(1999, 1, 4)\n    >>> last_date # doctest: +SKIP\n    datetime.date(2016, 11, 14)\n\n+ ``currencies`` is a set containing all available currencies\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> c.currencies # doctest: +SKIP\n    set(['SGD', 'CAD', 'SEK', 'GBP', ...\n    >>> 'AAA' in c.currencies\n    False\n    >>> c.convert(100, 'AAA')\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ValueError: AAA is not a supported currency\n\nFinally, you can use your own currency file, as long as it has the same format (ECB):\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # Load the packaged data (might not be up to date)\n    c = CurrencyConverter()\n\n    # Load the up to date full history\n    c = CurrencyConverter('http://www.ecb.int/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-hist.zip')\n\n    # Load only the latest rates (single day data source)\n    c = CurrencyConverter('http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref.zip')\n\n    # Load your custom file\n    c = CurrencyConverter('./path/to/currency/file.csv')\n",
