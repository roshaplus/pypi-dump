    "description": "rtyaml: Round-trippable YAML\n============================\n\nPrimary author: Joshua Tauberer <http://razor.occams.info>\n\n* GitHub: https://github.com/unitedstates/rtyaml\n* PyPi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rtyaml\n\nThis module provides wrappers around ``pyyaml`` to set sane defaults:\n\n* round-tripping YAML files is possible by preserving field order\n* saner output defaults are set for strings\n* a comment block found at the very beginning of a stream when loading YAML is preserved when writing it back out\n\nInstall::\n\n   pip install rtyaml\n   (or pip3 --- this module works in both Python 2 and Python 3)\n\nUsage::\n\n   import rtyaml\n   stuff = rtyaml.load(open(\"myfile.yaml\"))\n   # ...do things to stuf...\n   rtyaml.dump(stuff, open(\"myfile.yaml\", \"w\"))\n\nAs in the underlying pyyaml library, ``load`` accepts a byte string containing YAML, a Unicode string containing YAML, an open binary file object, or an open text file object. Also, the second argument to ``dump`` is optional and if omitted the function returns the YAML in a string.\n\n``load_all`` and ``dump_all`` are also supported, which load and save lists of documents using YAML's ``---`` document separator.\n\nDependencies\n-------------\n\n* pyyaml (in Ubuntu, the ``python-yaml`` or ``python3-yaml`` package)\n* libyaml (in Ubuntu, the ``libyaml-0-2`` package plus, at install time only, ``libyaml-dev``)\n\nDetails\n-------\n\nThis library does the following:\n\n* Uses the native libyaml CSafeLoader and CDumper for both speed and trustable operations.\n* Parses mappings as OrderedDicts so that the field order remains the same when dumping the file later.\n* Writes unicode strings without any weird YAML tag. They just appear as strings. Output is UTF-8 encoded, and non-ASCII characters appear as Unicode without escaping.\n* Writes multi-line strings in block mode rather than quoted with embedded \"\\n\"'s, choosing between the literal or folded mode depending on what looks better for the length of the lines in the string.\n* Writes mappings and lists in the expanded (one per line) format, which is nice when the output is going in version control.\n* Modifies the string quote rules so that any string made up of digits is serialized with quotes. (The default settings serialize the string \"01\" with quotes but the string \"09\" without quotes! (Can you figure out why?))\n* Serializes null values as the tilde rather than as \"null\" (without quotes), which I think is less confusing.\n* If a block comment appears at the start of the file (i.e. one or more lines starting with a '#'), write it back out if the same object is written with rtyaml.dump().\n\nPublic domain dedication\n------------------------\n\nThis project is dedicated to the public domain, as indicated in the LICENSE file:\n\n\tThe project is in the public domain within the United States, and copyright and related rights in the work worldwide are waived through the CC0 1.0 Universal public domain dedication. http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\nAll contributions to this project must be released under the CC0 dedication.
