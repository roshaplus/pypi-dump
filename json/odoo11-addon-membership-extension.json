For example, if you\nhave several levels of partnership (Starter, Silver, Gold) and one product\nfor each one, then partners who buy Silver product will have Silver membership\ncategory. Afterwords, you can filter Silver members.\n\nMembership lines are created when a membership product is invoiced, like in\nOdoo standard version. But now users can create a new membership line without\ncreating an invoice.\n\nAlso, users can edit membership line dates and state even if an invoice is\nnot related with it.\n\nYou will see a general membership status at partner level that specifies if\nit's a member of any category or not, and also a detail status per\nmembership category.\n\nTo make member start date independent from the associated member one, check the\noption *Adhered member* in the membership tab of the partner who is associating.\nA start date will now be available to edit.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/208/10.0\n\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues\n<https://github.com/OCA/vertical-association/issues>`_.
