    "description": "|PyPI|\n\nEver did a mistake to ``pip install`` in the terminal when installing\npackages from ``requirements.txt`` file like following?\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install requirements.txt\n    Collecting requirements.txt\n      Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement requirements.txt (from versions: )\n    No matching distribution found for requirements.txt\n\nNow you wont. Thanks to some nasty hacks and tricks there is a package\non PyPI that handles that. It finds the desired requirements file and\ninstalls it in your current environment.\n\n::\n\n    echo \"gevent\" > requirements-dev.txt\n    pip install requirements-dev.txt\n\nThis package was made only for trolling so do not expect it to work. It\nmay work on Linux and Mac OS X but was not extensively tested. It is\nalso a one-shot trick so no updates will be installed once you do that\nunless you specify a ``-U`` or ``--update`` switch. Happy debugging!\n\nPyPI (fortunately) does not allow to upload package named\n``requirements.txt`` so the only supported name is currently a\n``requirements-dev.txt``. It still should be quite popular though.\n\n.. |PyPI| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/downloads-enough-ff69b4.svg\n   :target:",
