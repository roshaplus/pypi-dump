    "description": "Rapid Framework\n===============\n\nRapid Framework is a tool for integrating Continuous Integration, Automatic Testing, Automatic Building and Continuous Deployment in a quality and\nefficient manner.\n\nWhy Rapid?\n----------\n\nRapid was built with ease and scalability in mind. There are various features which allow you to take control of your builds and know what is happening\nat all times. Rapid makes your CI Solution infrastructure. It simply works.\n\nRapid was built to be small and efficient. Rapid is a layered system which allows you to be free to scale your infrastructure as needed. Rapid is the\nonly CI Solution that we know of that can build and release itself with no down time.\n\nHave you ever used a system that runs out of memory? Ever have a client blow up and you can't recover? That doesn't happen with Rapid. Try it out!\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nServer - System that supports python. At least 60MB of RAM! That's it!\nClient - System that supports python. At least 30MB of RAM! That's it!\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Multi Staged pipelines\n- Parallel Workflows\n- Sliced Actions\n- Ability to track time for all parts of your build\n- Re-run Action possibility\n- Prioritized builds\n- Interstitial Runs\n- Targeted clients\n- Distributed Logging\n- Automatic upgrades\n- 24/7 Uptime - Install a new version and restart in 200ms!\n- Behavior Point Test Mapping\n- UWSGI integration\n- Massive Scaling\n- Github Integration for handling webhooks\n- Release Step Mapping and workflows\n- External process integration and workflow\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  $ pip install rapid-framework\n\n\nOptions\n-------\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n  $ rapid --help\n\n\nusage: rapid [-h] [-f CONFIG_FILE] [-p PORT] [-m] [-c] [-l] [-d LOG_DIR]\n             [-q QA_DIR] [--downgrade DB_DOWNGRADE] [--create_db]\n             [--create_migration MIGRATE]\n\nRapid Framework client main control\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -f CONFIG_FILE, --config CONFIG_FILE\n                        config file path\n  -p PORT, --port PORT  Port for the master to listen on\n  -m, --master          Master mode is default\n  -c, --client          Client mode\n  -l, --logging         Logging mode\n  -d LOG_DIR, --log_dir LOG_DIR\n                        Logging directory\n  -q QA_DIR, --qa_dir QA_DIR\n                        QA Dir\n  --downgrade DB_DOWNGRADE\n                        Downgrade db for alembic\n  --create_db           Create initial db\n  --create_migration MIGRATE\n                        Create Migration for alembic\n\nLicense\n-------\nRapid is **licensed** under the **Apache 2.0 License**.
