It allows to automatically create a write-off\nentry for the amount paid by the customers when they received dunning\nfees (using the **Account Credit Control** module).\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nAs this module aims to automatize the ``Statement Operation Templates``,\nyou first want to ensure that you have an operation configured for the\ndunning fees.\nYou can find them in ``Invoicing > Configuration > Miscellaneous >\nStatement Operation Templates``. An example of operation is (the account\nis where the amount received for the dunning fees will be input):\n\n=================== ========================== ======= ============\nAccount             Amount Type                Amount  Label\n=================== ========================== ======= ============\nDepends of the l10n Percentage of open balance 100.0 % Dunning Fees\n=================== ========================== ======= ============\n\nThe configuration of the rules themselves happens in ``Invoicing >\nConfiguration > Miscellaneous > Statement Operation Rules``.\n\nThere is no conditions to setup on this rule. It will be applied if the\namount in the bank statement line is above the journal entries amount\nand if the difference is comprised in the amount of the dunning fees for\nthe journal entries.\n\nExample:\n\n======================= ======\nDocument                Amount\n======================= ======\nJournal Entry (invoice) 100.-\nDunning Fees no1        5.-\nDunning Fees no2        10.-\nDunning Fees no3        15.-\n======================= ======\n\nThe customer received 3 times dunning fees, with a increasing amount.\nThe customer might pay from 100.- to 115.-. The difference between\n100.- and what the customer paid above goes to the write-off account\nconfigured on the operation. If the customer pays 99.- or 116.-, the\nDunning Fees rule is not valid and the other rules will be evaluated.\n\n.. note:: The Dunning Fees rule must be placed before the Roundings\n          rules, otherwise the fees might be confused with roundings.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/website/image/ir.attachment/5784_f2813bd/datas\n   :alt: Try me on Runbot\n   :target: https://runbot.odoo-community.org/runbot/98/8.0\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nThis module only works with the ``account_credit_control_dunning_fees``\nmodule in the project: https://github.com/OCA/account-financial-tools\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n* Guewen Baconnier <guewen.baconnier@camptocamp.com>\n\nMaintainer\n----------\n\n.. image:: http://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: http://odoo-community.org\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and promote its widespread use.\n\nTo contribute to this module, please visit http://odoo-community.org.",
