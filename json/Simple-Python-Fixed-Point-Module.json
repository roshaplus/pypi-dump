    "description": "FixedPoint (SPFPM) is a pure-Python module which provides basic facilities for\r\nmanipulating fixed-point numbers of essentially arbitrary precision. It aims to\r\nbe more suitable for simulating binary fixed-point artihmetic within electronic\r\nhardware (e.g. for digital signal processing (DSP) applications) than the\r\nDecimal package, which is more concerned with fixed-point arithmetic in base-10.\r\nSPFPM supports basic arithmetic operations as well as a range of mathematical\r\nfunctions including sqrt, exp, sin, cos, atan etc.",
