    "description": "The GS1 UK Experimental GTIN Application Programming Interface Testing Service is a prototype service that is made\navailable to specific GS1 UK members with the aim of fast-checking thousands of barcoded product data.\nA GTIN (global trade item number) is the name of the barcode value uniquely identifying each product.\nPrevious names for the GTIN are EAN in Europe and UPC in the USA. This checker works to test:\n1. That each GTIN has the correct integrity; that is, it is the right length, in the correct format, and with the correct syntactical makeup.\n2. The GTIN\u2019s prefix value is correctly assigned to correct GS1 UK member.\n3. The GTIN\u2019s prefix value is correctly assigned to correct member in the world where we have this information.\n4. The product\u2019s description matches \u2013 or mostly matches \u2013 a product description that GS1 UK has on file, where we have this information.\nThe API allows thousands of GTIN values to be sent and tested in real-time. This interface uses standard web API principles:\n1. A POST request interface over secure web HTTP\n2. Data values accepted in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format\n3. A response also in JSON format\nIn order to provide security and controlled access, only members who have been provided\nwith an appropriate \u2018key\u2019 may access the service at this time.\nThe prototype nature of this service means that users must accept occasional errors and performance issues from time to time.\nTherefore this checker is provided on an \u2018as-is\u2019 basis.\nHowever, members involved in using this service are able to help shape it in a manner that fits best with their\nGTIN-checking requirements, with fast development-time turnaround. Working together we can shape the correct product with\na view to a future production system.",
