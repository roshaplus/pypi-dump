    "description": "What is Pympress?\n=================\n\nPympress is a little PDF reader written in Python using Poppler for PDF\nrendering and GTK+ for the GUI.\n\nIt is designed to be a dual-screen reader used for presentations and\npublic talks, with two displays: the *Content window* for a projector,\nand the *Presenter window* for your laptop. It is portable and has been\ntested on various Mac, Windows and Linux systems.\n\nIt comes with many great features: - supports embedded videos - text\nannotations displayed in the presenter window - natively supports\nbeamer's *notes on second screen*!\n\nPympress is a free software, distributed under the terms of the GPL\nlicense (version 2 or, at your option, any later version).\n\nThis is now a fork of `Schnouki's original\nPympress <https://github.com/Schnouki/pympress>`__, at least for now.\n\nInstalling\n==========\n\nIf you have python\n------------------\n\nUsing pip\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nRun the following command in your shell (or replace ``python3 -m pip``\nwith ``python -m pip`` or just ``pip``):\n\n::\n\n    python3 -m pip install pympress\n\nOr you can get it from github:\n\n::\n\n    python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/Cimbali/pympress#egg=pympress\n\nIf you don't have pip, see `the python documentation on\ninstalling <https://docs.python.org/3.5/installing/index.html>`__. You\nmay also want to check that you have all `the\ndependencies <#dependencies>`__.\n\nFrom source\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you also want the source code, you can clone this repo or grab `the\nlatest releases'\nsource <https://github.com/Cimbali/pympress/releases/latest>`__, open a\nconsole where you put the code, and type ``python3 -m pip install .``\n(or, if you plan on modifying that code,\n``python3 -m pip install -e .``). Same remarks as above apply.\n\nBinary install\n--------------\n\nIf you don't want to know about source code or dependencies, this is for\nyou. Grab `the latest installer for your\nplatform <https://github.com/Cimbali/pympress/releases/latest>`__ and\nexecute it. You're done!\n\nCurrently binaries are only available for windows (.msi files). Choose\npackages with 'amd64' in the name if you have a 64 bit machine, 'x86' if\nyou have a 32 bit machine. The 'vlc' suffix indicates that this\ninstaller ships VLC as well to support video, so try it if the other\nversion fails to read videos.\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nPympress relies on: \\* Python, 3.x or 2.7 (with\n`setuptools <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`__, which is\nusually shipped by default with python). \\*\n`Poppler <http://poppler.freedesktop.org/>`__, the PDF rendering\nlibrary. \\* `Cairo <https://www.cairographics.org/>`__ (and python\nbindings for cairo), the graphics library which to pre-render and draw\nover PDF pages. \\* `Gtk+ 3 <http://www.gtk.org/>`__, a toolkit for\ncreating graphical user interfaces. \\* `PyGi, the python bindings for\nGtk+3 <https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/PyGObject>`__. PyGi is also known\nas *pygobject3*, just *pygobject* or *python3-gi*. \\* Introspection\nbindings for poppler may be shipped separately, ensure you have those as\nwell (``typelib-1_0-Poppler-0_18`` on OpenSUSE, ``gir1.2-poppler-0.18``\non Ubuntu) \\* optionally `VLC <https://www.videolan.org/vlc/>`__, to\nplay videos (with the same bitness as Python) \\* optionally\n`gettext <https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>`__, to get a translated\nversion of Pympress.\n\nGettext is part of libc on Linux, and part of the PyGi installer on\nWindows. On Mac OS X, you can `use brew to install\ngettext <http://stackoverflow.com/a/33896321/1387346>`__.\n\nOn windows GTK+3, Poppler and their python bindings are all shipped\ntogether in `the PyGi\ninstaller <https://sourceforge.net/projects/pygobjectwin32/>`__. *Be\nsure to check the supported Python versions (up to 3.4 at the time of\nwriting)*, they appear in the FEATURES list in the linked page.\n\nOn other platforms they are often installed by default, or easily\navailable through your package or software manager. For example, on\nubuntu, you can run the following as root to make sure you have all the\nprerequisites *assuming you use python3*:\n\n::\n\n    apt-get install python3 python3-pip libgtk-3-0 libpoppler-glib8 libcairo2 python3-gi python3-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-poppler-0.18\n\nDifferent distributions might have different package naming conventions,\nfor example the equivalent on OpenSUSE would be:\n\n::\n\n    zypper in python3 python3-pip libgtk-3-0 libpoppler-glib8 libcairo2 python3-gobject python3-gobject-Gdk python3-cairo typelib-1_0-GdkPixbuf-2_0 typelib-1_0-Gtk-3_0 typelib-1_0-Poppler-0_18\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nOpening a file\n--------------\n\nSimply start Pympress and it will ask you what file you want to open.\nYou can also start pympress from the command line with a file to open\nlike so: ``pympress slides.pdf``\n\nFunctionalities\n---------------\n\nAll functionalities are available from the menus of the window with\nslide previews. Don't be afraid to experiment with them!\n\nKeyboard shortcuts are also listed in these menus. Some more usual\nshortcuts are often available, for example ``Ctrl``\\ +\\ ``L``, and\n``F11`` also toggle fullscreen, though the main shortcut is just ``F``.\n\nA few of the fancier functionalities are listed here: - **Swap\nscreens**: If Pympress mixed up which screen is the projector and which\nis not, press ``S`` - **Go To Slide**: To jump to a selected slide\nwithout flashing through the whole presentation on the projector, press\n``G`` or click the \"current slide\" box.\n\nA spin box will appear, and you will be able to navigate through your\nslides in the presenter window only by scrolling your mouse, with the\n``Home``/``Up``/``Down``/``End`` keys, with the + and - buttons of the\nspin box, or simply by typing in the number of the slide. Press\n``Enter`` to validate going to the new slide or ``Esc`` to cancel. -\n**Estimated talk time**: Click the ``Time estimation`` box and set your\nplanned talk duration. You can also pass this on the command line\nthrough the ``-ett`` flag. The color will allow you to see at a glance\nhow much time you have left. - **Adjust screen centering**: If your\nslides' form factor doesn't fit the projectors' and you don't want the\nslide centered in the window, use the \"Screen Center\" option in the\n\"Presentation\" menu. - **Resize Current/Next slide**: You can drag the\nbar between both slides on the Presenter window to adjust their relative\nsizes to your liking. - **Preferences**: Some of your choices are saved\nin a configuration file, in *~/.config/pympress* or *~/.pympress* on\nlinux, and in *%APPDATA%/pympress.ini* on windows. - **Cache**: For\nefficiency, Pympress caches rendered pages (up to 200 by default). If\nthis is too memory consuming for you, you can change this number in the\nconfiguration file.\n\nHacking\n=======\n\nFeel free to clone this repo and use it, modify it, redistribute it,\netc, under the GPLv2+. Pympress has inline sphinx documentation (`Google\nstyle <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/latest/ext/example_google.html>`__,\ncontains rst syntax), and the `docs\nfolder <https://github.com/Cimbali/pympress/tree/master/docs/>`__\ncontains the documentation generated from it, hosted on `the github\npages of this\nrepo <https://cimbali.github.io/pympress/pympress.html>`__.\n\nTranslations\n------------\n\nIf you want to add a translation, check if\n``pympress/share/locale/<language>/pympress.po`` already exists. If not,\ntake `the template\nfile <https://github.com/Cimbali/pympress/tree/master/pympress/share/locale/pympress.pot>`__\nas input and translate all the strings, then add it to the repo in\n``pympress/share/locale/<language>/pympress.po``. Finally pass this .po\nfile to msgfmt and add the output to the repo at\n``pympress/share/locale/<language>/LC_MESSAGES/pympress.mo``.",
