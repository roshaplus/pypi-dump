    "description": "\ufeff# Scrython\nScrython is a wrapper for the Scryfall API, designed for an easier use. Make sure to familiarize yourself with the docs.\n## Breaking changes\nSince Scryfall's API is constantly changing, this library will also be changing.\n\nVersions will be broken down as such:\n\n0: Overall library version\n0.x: Changes that will break previous functionality\n0.x.x: Changes that Scryfall has made to break functionality.\n\nIt's important to keep up to date with library changes, since it relies on how Scryfall has updated it's own API. If they change something, my library will potentially break or be outdated until a fix is patched.\n\n## Basic usage\nScrython can be imported using `import scrython` at the top of your code.\nI've written to library to attempt to be familiar for those who already use it. As such, modules like `cards` are named to reflect the endpoints found in `api.scryfall.com/cards/`and so on.\nFor the most part I've kept all the class attributes the same as their key names, except for a few cases where I've found better functionality.\n\n```\n    >>>import scrython\n    >>>card = scrython.cards.Named(fuzzy=\"Black Lotus\")\n    >>>card.name()\n    'Black Lotus'\n    >>>card.id()\n    'bd8fa327-dd41-4737-8f19-2cf5eb1f7cdd'\n    >>>card.oracle_text()\n    '{T}, Sacrifice Black Lotus: Add three mana of any one color to your mana pool.'\n```\n\n## Key features\n\n - Asyncronous requests. This library utilizes the `asyncio` and `aiohttp` libraries to ensure that requests are not blocked when used in asyncronous environments. There is no delay limiting when making a request, so be careful how many objects are created.\n - Full use of all endpoints in a given category. This library uses every endpoint within `cards` and `rulings`as of writing this. I hope to include more as this is developed.",
